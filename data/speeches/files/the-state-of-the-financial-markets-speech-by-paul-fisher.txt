The Bank of England has two core purposes. The first is maintaining monetary stability. That means
achieving stable prices as defined by the Government and ensuring confidence in the currency. The second
is contributing to financial stability. That entails identifying, monitoring, and taking action to remove or reduce
systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system. The interim
Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was set up by the Government earlier this year to help meet this
objective.1 It has now had its first round of meetings and a record of its first policy meeting and the
associated Financial Stability Report were published just last week.2

To help meet these objectives, the Bank runs a Market Intelligence (MI) programme, which involves frequent
meetings and conversations between Bank staff and a wide range of external market contacts to gather and
analyse information from market participants. The Bank is uniquely positioned to run such a programme,
given its public policy objectives, its own sterling and foreign currency operations, and its location within one
of the world’s foremost international financial centres. Up to 70 Bank staff, the vast majority of whom have
other, full-time operational duties, help to collect MI as part of their day-to-day responsibilities. Personally, I
estimate that, over the past 6 months, I have been involved on average in two meetings with market contacts
every working day. Our external contact base is very extensive,3 internationally diverse,4 and covers a wide
range of markets, from vanilla instruments such as gilts and equities through to all manner of derivatives.
This MI programme makes a crucial contribution to meeting the Bank’s core purposes by (partially) making
up for missing data (at least qualitatively and occasionally quantitatively) and helping us to understand better
the behavioural patterns that underlie movements in financial variables. On the monetary policy side, for
example, it can shed light on the drivers of commodity prices and changes in market-based measures of
inflation expectations. On the financial stability side, the significant complexities in the financial system, the
lack of data and the constantly and rapidly evolving nature of financial markets mean that MI is particularly
useful in helping us spot the emergence of stress and new developments and risks that might introduce
potential vulnerabilities and fault lines in parts of the financial system.
Today, I want to use the insights gained from our market intelligence work, together with market data, to
provide an overall assessment of the state of financial markets, including the extent to which they have
recovered since the depths of the financial crisis, the impact of a renewed reach for yield on financial
innovation, and the impact of the regulatory agenda on market functioning.

The evolution of financial markets during the crisis

To set the scene, it is instructive to look at the general pattern in markets over the past few years. Chart 1
uses a ‘heat-map’ to summarise data on issuance and spreads in primary and secondary markets for
selected bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS), compared to their historical averages. The widespread
panic and financial market seizure of 2008 is clearly visible in the concentration of red and grey segments.
The latter represent those periods in which there was no primary issuance or spread data because the
markets were effectively closed.

(a) Shading is based on a score that reflects, for unguaranteed debt, both issuance (relative to
GDP) and spreads in primary markets and secondary markets, expressed as a number of standard
deviations from average, using as much data as was available from January 1998. Updated to endMay 2011; recent months use 2011 Q1 GDP.
(b) Insufficient data for UK CMBS secondary markets.

Since the nadir in late 2008, most markets have been on a course of gradual healing. The heat map shows
how issuance and spreads in these particular markets have recovered. Advanced economy corporate bond
spreads have fallen back sharply since their peaks (Chart 2). Measures of volatility and bid-offer spreads
across a range of asset classes have also fallen back since the height of the disruption (Charts 3 and 4).
And most international equity indices have picked up markedly since their troughs (Chart 5).

This recovery in markets has been neither uniform nor smooth. For example, a number of markets were
severely disrupted by concerns about the debt sustainability in Greece, Ireland and Portugal in mid 2010,
and once again during 2011 (Charts 6 and 7 show these countries’ bond spreads to German Bunds and
sovereign CDS premia). And a number of private sector markets, such as the ‘own label’ US residential
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) market and the UK commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
market have seen very little, if any, primary issuance since the crisis. 5 In part that reflects continued
weakness in commercial real estate and (to a lesser extent) residential housing markets. But it is also likely
to reflect the combination of a large existing stock of ABS and a diminished investor base as many of the
funding mechanisms have been swept away. These factors have slowed the recovery in primary issuance,
and suggest that ABS markets are likely to be much smaller in future. Indeed some markets that were at the
epicentre of the crisis, such as those for structured collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), may be
permanently gone.

Despite a number of shocks along the way, markets have been increasing in their resilience over the past
two years. For example, UK banks have been able to continue to issue debt in both public and private
markets during 2011, in spite of renewed sovereign debt concerns, the natural disasters in Japan and civil
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.6 Moreover, that issuance has been spread across an
increasingly diverse range of instruments including, more recently, UK RMBS (Chart 8). This has helped the
UK banks alleviate concerns about the ‘funding cliff’ of official sector refinancing at the end of 2011. For
example, it has facilitated the remarkable pre-emptive reduction in the amount outstanding under the Bank’s

Just in the past couple of weeks we have seen the first European CMBS to be issued since August 2007. In the United Kingdom,
some corporates have issued long-dated fixed-rate bonds secured on real estate as part of sale and leaseback transactions. Market
participants, however, tend to regard these transactions as corporate debt, rather than CMBS.

Market intelligence suggests that the major UK banks have raised around £25bn in private markets in the year-to-date 2011.

But this is no time for complacency. UK bank funding costs, as proxied by their CDS premia, remain
elevated – both relative to their historical average, and relative to European non-financial corporations’ CDS
premia (Chart 10). And there remain significant risks going forward. Sovereign strains, and their potential
impact on the European banking sector in particular, represent the most immediate and material threat to
markets generally and to UK financial stability. As a result, the interim FPC have recommended that the
major UK banks provide improved and more comprehensive disclosure of their sovereign and banking sector
exposures. There is also event risk associated with the forthcoming publication of the EBA stress test
results, if the results are markedly different from market expectations.

The search for yield/assets

The significant recovery in many global financial markets reflects, in part, the actions of policymakers around
the world. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England responded to the collapse in economic activity and
the risk of deflation by cutting official interest rates and embarking on a programme of asset purchases
financed by the creation of central bank reserves (known as Quantitative Easing). It also separately sought
to stimulate markets for corporate debt and commercial paper, and put in place a Special Liquidity Scheme
for banks to swap their illiquid collateral for highly liquid T-bills. Other central banks took a variety of similar
actions. For example, the Federal Reserve began purchasing a range of private and public sector securities
in large scale. And in Europe, the ECB responded by offering its counterparty banks unlimited refinancing
operations at maturities of up to 12 months.

Despite these differences in policy, one end result was common – they led to a massive expansion of central
bank balance sheets (Chart 11) and a significant injection of liquidity into the global financial system. That
in turn pushed down yields on ‘safe’ assets, encouraging portfolio rebalancing (one of the key channels
through which asset purchases work) and a ‘reach for yield’.7

More recently contacts, especially those in the United States, have reported that the reach for yield has been
exacerbated by a perceived reduction in the universe of acceptable assets for real money investors.8 For
example major corporates, especially those in the United States, are reported to be relatively cash rich. Flow
of funds data suggest that the US corporate sector is holding around $1trn – or 7% of total corporate sector
financial assets – in cash. That has led to a reduction in US investment grade net bond issuance and an
associated shortage of high-quality corporate assets, at a time when relative demand for those assets is
strong. And there has also been a reduction in US T-bill issuance, amid ongoing concerns about the
extension of the US government’s debt ceiling. Similarly, serious concerns about the creditworthiness of a
number of euro-area sovereign issuers have led to a reduction in the quantum of euro-denominated assets
perceived to be ‘safe’, with some US money funds reducing their exposures to European banking sectors.
7

As described by Janet Yellen in her recent speech “Assessing potential financial imbalances in an era of accommodative monetary
policy”.

It is still early days, but the combination of portfolio rebalancing and this reported shortage of specific
high-quality assets might have wider implications for financial stability if it encourages investors to look for
additional yield by moving into more illiquid products (by investing in new asset classes or in derivatives of
more liquid underlying instruments) or into more complex products (which they might not fully understand,
and which might not be appropriately priced for correlation, optionality or underlying credit risk). Market
intelligence is crucial here, in that it can provide us with near real-time information about whether and where
these risks might be building (or eventually crystallising).

So far, there is little evidence of excessive risk-taking on a generalised basis across the financial system.
But the intelligence we have gathered during 2011, notwithstanding the recent pull-back in June, has flagged
a number of pockets of increasing risk appetite and a few specific markets which have been showing signs of
excess. That tendency seems to have been most prevalent in the United States, where the financial and real
economy recoveries appear somewhat more established than in the UK and the euro area (Chart 12). But
during recent discussions, some market participants have noted that this tendency has begun to spread to
Europe as well.

One example comes from the high-yield corporate bond markets, where demand has been very strong and
where issuance, which reached record levels in 2010, has continued apace in 2011 (Chart 13). That is likely
to reflect the generalised disintermediation of stricken banking systems – for those that are able to tap capital
markets, bond issuance poses a useful alternative to bank lending. Moreover the extent of high-yield

issuance may reflect the fact that it is smaller businesses, which are likely to be sub-investment grade, who
are finding it hardest to secure affordable bank finance.9 Given oligopolistic banking systems like those in
the UK, a deeper and more liquid capital market might help improve the supply of credit to UK businesses.
Indeed, recent MI has suggested that there has been some direct lending activity to mid-sized corporates in
the UK by non-bank institutions such as dedicated loan, private equity and pension funds (although the
absolute amounts are still very small).

Bank of England Working Paper no. 253.

The Bank’s model-based estimates suggest that US high-yield and investment grade corporate debt
currently reflect historically low risk premia, and so may be vulnerable to a correction (Chart 14). Moreover
although much of the recent issuance reflects refinancing of existing bonds or loans (with companies seeking
to lock in low interest rates and extend maturities) and M&A activity, there have also been growing reports of
US issuance to finance ‘dividend recapitalisations’ (where debt is issued to pay special dividends). Issuance
of covenant-lite leveraged loans (which include fewer of the usual protective covenants for the benefit of the
lending party) was $34bn in the first five months of 2011, compared with $8bn in the whole of 2010. And US
contacts have reported renewed issuance of bonds with Payment-in-Kind (PIK) toggles (where issuers have
the option of deferring cash interest payments, choosing instead to roll interest payments into additional debt
securities). Although the incidence of these sorts of deals remains significantly below that associated with

And although the aggregate US corporate sector cash position is strong, it is likely to mask significant heterogeneity in the distribution
of firms, with a disproportionate share of the cash held by the largest investment grade businesses.

the pre-crisis exuberance, these examples might be indicative of the reach for yield/assets encouraging
investors to chase returns via higher risk assets.
Despite the low-yield environment, market contacts have been telling us that some investors’ expectations of
returns were little changed by the crisis, reflecting a combination of investor inertia and the need to earn
sufficient returns to cover their liabilities. But we also hear that investment horizons are often shorter and
tolerance of volatility and desire for leverage is lower. Something clearly has to give here – investors know –
and must remember – that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that additional return involves
additional risk. The macro-prudential concern is that the reach for yield encourages financial innovation and
growth in some parts of the financial system where the risks are not well understood,10 especially if it leads to
greater interconnectedness within the banking system. This is one area which is likely to warrant further
attention and analysis by the FPC in due course.

Financial innovation and the emergence/growth of new products

The financial industry is characterised by its tendency to innovate, continuously designing and offering new
financial products to its customers. In my view, financial innovation should be seen as a ‘good thing’ in
normal circumstances. It can lead to a more efficient allocation of capital and a reduction in the costs of
financial intermediation, both of which should help sustain real economic growth. For example, the rapid
growth of electronic trade execution in the foreign exchange market has increased the speed and ease with
which trades can be conducted. That should ultimately make international trade cheaper, bringing with it the
associated benefits. Improvements in technology can, by facilitating wider market access, also lead to
improved price discovery and market liquidity. Moreover, innovation can help issuers align the risk
characteristics of new products more closely to those that investors demand. In principle, that should
promote greater and more efficient sharing and spreading of risk across the financial system. In essence,
the recession which followed the financial crisis demonstrated how much the real economy depends on an
efficient, functioning financial system.

Financial innovation is a continuous process, and there are many examples of either new products or rapid
growth in fashionable markets during the past few years. For example during 2010, there were significant
developments in bank funding instruments such as putable CDs and evergreen repos.11 These products
offer higher returns to investors compared with more conventional instruments, and also improve banks’
ability to meet new regulatory rules. There has also been an increase in the prevalence of long-term
collateral upgrade trades where, for example, a real money investor lends a bank gilts against less liquid but
higher yielding assets. Those repo transactions help the real money investor achieve a higher return, while
banks build up their liquid asset buffers and fund their less liquid collateral. In that regard, these repo
10

That could come about not only through the low yields on safe assets, but also through an increase in the correlation amongst safe
assets, which might prompt reserves managers to seek new diversification opportunities, some of which might be met through financial
engineering.
11
These products are discussed in more detail in the box on pages 168-169 of the 2010 Q3 Quarterly Bulletin.

transactions look quite similar to a private sector version of the SLS. Where appropriate, such transactions
can both improve the returns to pension funds and support lending to the real economy. Of course, the
authorities need to monitor the extent to which these transactions strengthen the links between the banking
and insurance sectors. And it is vital that the insurers fully understand the counterparty credit risk they are
running, the quality of the collateral they are taking and how to manage the collateral in the event of default.
The more recent developments in markets for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are another example of
financial innovation and growth in a previously small market. ETFs are in principle a ‘good’ financial
innovation – for example, they offer retail investors a cheaper way of getting exposure to the underlying
asset (by cutting out the fund manager) and provide a very liquid asset. Nonetheless, the rapid growth in
ETF assets under management – which have increased seven-fold since 2003 (Chart 15) – merit attention,
given it has been characterised by increasing complexity, opacity and interconnectedness, and as some
practices, if left unchecked, could grow to pose risks to the stability of the financial system.12

(a) Data to end-May 2011

Take for example synthetic ETFs provided by asset management arms of banks. These ETFs replicate an
index return using derivatives but without necessarily physically purchasing the underlying assets. Synthetic
ETF providers (typically banks) might have an incentive to collateralise the total return swap with illiquid
collateral that is expensive to fund elsewhere in the market. If the swap counterparty defaults on its leg of
the transaction, the ETF (and hence the end investor) would be left holding this collateral, which might have
very different liquidity and credit characteristics to the securities it originally planned to invest in. In
12

The Bank first discussed ETFs in a box on pages 40-41 of the June 2010 Financial Stability Report. Since then, ETFs have been the
recent focus of much international attention, including at the BIS, the FSB and the IMF (see http://www.bis.org/publ/work343.pdf,
http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_110412b.pdf and the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report
(http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/fmu/eng/2011/02/pdf/0611.pdf) respectively).

particular, if the investor unwittingly takes on collateral whose value is highly correlated with the ETF provider
(i.e. if there is so-called wrong way risk), then the collateral is likely to have relatively little value in the event
of default. Some of these issues are discussed in the June Financial Stability Report.

The examples I have cited above involve fundamentally good financial products which should improve
economic efficiency and hence the welfare of society as a whole. But the growth of the more opaque version
of these products marks them out, and unmonitored excess could compromise these markets in the future.
Recent history is rife with examples of where over-exuberance has led to opacity, severe market difficulties
and financial instability (e.g. the rise of CDO2 in the securitisation markets). In such cases, the costs of
collapse can easily outweigh the previous benefits. It is important that the authorities monitor the ETF
industry and make sure that market participants understand the risks they may be running. It is for that
reason that the interim FPC advised the FSA last week that its bank supervisors should monitor closely the
risks associated with opaque funding structures, such as collateral swaps or similar transactions employed
by ETFs.

Regulatory responses
The financial crisis exposed a need to not just strengthen but to completely re-design aspects of financial
regulation, to try to find a solution to ‘too big to fail’ problem and hence minimise the chances of something
similar happening again (if financial institutions could fail without large spillovers then much other regulation
might be unnecessary). The resulting regulatory agenda is formidable – including agreeing the detailed rules
supporting Dodd Frank in the US; EMIR and Solvency II in Europe; the new Basel rules on capital and
liquidity including the SIFI surcharge internationally; the final outcome of the ICB in the UK; various FSB
initiatives and many more besides. I do not intend today to discuss the merits of the various ongoing
regulatory initiatives. Rather I want to briefly comment objectively on their impact on the state of financial
markets.

It is clear that many individual regulatory initiatives are not yet parameterised or sufficiently detailed for
market participants to anticipate their effects fully. And the extent to which regulations might eventually differ
across geographical and legal jurisdictions is also still unclear. There is no implied criticism here –
re-designing the regulatory frameworks for, among others, banks, insurance companies and rating agencies,
takes time, and a lasting, well-planned robust set of regulations that will stand for many years to come is
surely preferable to a hastily-agreed but inadequate framework. The authorities nationally and internationally
are pushing the agenda hard to come up with the right decisions as quickly as possible.

The progress of the regulatory agenda has, however, created additional uncertainty in financial markets
which is reflected in investor behaviour and in some market prices. For example, market intelligence
suggests that it is one of the factors contributing to the continued elevated funding costs for many banks. In

12

due course, the various regulatory initiatives will produce detailed rules. As that happens one can expect a
variety of reactions. On one level, there is likely to be some shift of activity between markets and business
models as participants evaluate where the new rules establish new incentives. Beyond that, there might well
be some general improvement in market functioning, reflecting the reduction in regulatory uncertainty and
the more resilient financial system that the regulatory agenda is designed to deliver. At the moment, market
intelligence suggests that market participants are focussed on the elevated uncertainty and have not yet
anticipated the benefits of, for example, a safer banking system.

Conclusion

Financial markets have come a long way since the epicentre of the crisis in 2008, with many markets that
were significantly impaired in the crisis now functioning well. That progress is encouraging in terms of
financial stability and support for the real economy, but further healing is still required. Looking ahead, there
are some clear obstacles to that process. The sovereign debt crisis, currently focussed on the euro area, is
one. And the general recovery in the macroeconomic outlook is another. There will also be a lot of
uncertainty embedded in markets until final details are available on the majority of the regulatory agenda.
That agenda must be allowed to take sufficient time to get the right answers, but as these become available
we should expect to see further improvements in market functioning. Meanwhile, the authorities will need to
pay particular attention to the next rounds of financial innovation, especially given the prolonged low interest
rate environment.
