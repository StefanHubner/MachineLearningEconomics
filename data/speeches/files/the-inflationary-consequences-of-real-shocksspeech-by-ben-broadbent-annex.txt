The Monetary Policy Committee’s use of Optimal Policy Projections
1.
The MPC’s monetary policy remit requires it to maintain price stability, defined
by the Government to be a 12-month increase in CPI of 2%. The remit recognises
that inflation may deviate temporarily from the target on account of shocks, however.
Since 2013, the remit has explicitly recognised that in these circumstances, bringing
inflation back to target too rapidly could cause volatility in output and employment
that is undesirable. The remit requires the MPC to consider, balance and explain
such short-run monetary policy trade-offs. While the inflation target of 2% applies at
all times, the remit recognises that it can be desirable to manage trade-offs between
inflation and activity.
2.
This trade-off management in the MPC’s remit is consistent with an
economics literature on ‘flexible inflation targeting’. The positive relationship
between inflation and the output gap, which captures the extent to which activity is
above or below the economy’s potential, encapsulated in the slope of the Phillips
Curve lies at the core of this monetary policy trade-off. 1 The central bank can
address inflationary pressures only by compressing output. This may be desirable
when the economy is hit by demand shocks which push inflation and the output gap
in the same direction. But it generates a crucial trade-off in the presence of supply
shocks or cost-push shocks that can move inflation and output in opposite directions.
3.
During the preparation of the MPC’s forecasts, Bank staff produce
model-based simulations, Optimal Policy Projections (OPPs), designed to explore
this policy problem. 2 They seek to identify the best outcomes – in terms of inflation
and the output gap – that monetary policy could achieve, and the policy path that
would deliver them. And although there may not always be a trade-off between
inflation and activity, the OPPs remain useful in such circumstances by helping to
identify the optimal policy stance to return inflation to target and close the output gap.
4.
This is inevitably a highly conditional exercise. The OPPs take the MPC’s
forecast as given, assume that it is known and believed by all, and explore whether
adjusting monetary policy relative to the market curve on which the forecast is
conditioned can improve economic outcomes. 3
5.
The OPPs are not a perfect guide to policy. Like all model-based exercises,
they abstract from a number of important real-world policy considerations. For
example, there is no role for uncertainty or risks, whereas, in reality, uncertainty
about the outlook is likely to be an important factor in policy decisions. There is also
no time variation in the monetary transmission mechanism, for example to capture

Originally formulated by Phillips (1958), albeit as a relationship between wage growth and
unemployment.
2 OPPs have also been used by several other central banks, including the Federal Reserve which
publishes the paths in its Tealbook B, the Norges Bank and the Riksbank.
3 In using a different model to produce OPPs from that used to produce the MPC’s forecast, the
Bank’s approach follows that of Svennson and Tetlow (2005).

possible changes in the way the economy works over time. And the OPPs do not
consider interactions with other policymakers and tools.
6.
The policy model that is used for the OPPs formalises the monetary
transmission mechanism (MTM). It is a slightly simplified version of the DSGE
model used in the production of the MPC’s forecast, Compass, replacing rational
expectations with bounded rationality. 4 While agents in this model still have perfect
foresight of how the economy will evolve, they discount their knowledge of the future.
This makes real interest rates in the distant future less relevant for current
consumption decisions and therefore dampens the so-called ‘forward guidance
puzzle’ that would otherwise arise. 5
7.
The OPPs take the MPC’s forecast as given, and simulate optimal policy
responses conditional on that forecast.6 The policy problem is solved under the
assumption that the policymaker sets policy in a time-consistent way, such that they
re-optimise and decide on policy in every period. An alternative would be to assume
that the policymaker can credibly commit to a state-contingent policy plan, and solve
the problem only once for all periods. But in reality, it would likely be both infeasible
and undesirable for the MPC to commit to such a plan, not least because it would tie
the hands of future committees. 7
8.

The per-period loss function used to simulate the OPPs is:
𝐿𝑡 = (𝜋𝑡 − 𝜋 ∗ )2 + 𝜆(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ )2 + 𝛿(Δ𝑖𝑡 )2

where the parameters are set such that the policymaker dislikes in equal measure
the marginal effect of: a 1 percentage point deviation of annual inflation from target;
a 1/ 𝜆 percentage point deviation in the output gap; and a 1/ 𝛿 percentage point
change in the quarterly interest rate.
9.
The final term in the loss function implies that policymakers prefer small policy
rate changes to large ones. The inclusion of such ‘smoothing’ in the loss function
leads to gradual changes in policy paths and rules out sudden policy reversals
without explicitly needing to introduce non-linearity. This helps to generate policies
that are both stable and predictable. Calibrating the weight on interest rate
smoothing is difficult, and given the lack of a reasonable anchor, staff routinely show
the MPC OPPs under a range of different assumptions.
10.
The parameter attached to the output gap deviations, 𝜆, captures the essence
of the monetary policy trade-off and formally measures how wide an output gap the
policymaker is willing to bear in order to keep inflation close to target. Previous Bank
analysis has sought to identify the MPC’s implied lambda over the inflation targeting

The OPPs can inform the MPC’s decision-making in a variety of ways. 9 The
OPPs can be useful for illustrating trade-offs in the forecast and demonstrating the
likely path for rates that might be appropriate given a particular forecast. While this
can only be an input for policymakers, given the number of strong assumptions that
the OPPs rely on, it can be a useful discussion point, and help to inform
communications. It provides another lens on the policy outlook to sit alongside the
forecasts conditioned on the market curve and a constant path for Bank Rate.
