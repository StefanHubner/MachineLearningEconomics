CURBING THE CREDIT CYCLE
1. Introduction
Credit lies at the heart of crises. Credit booms sow the seeds of subsequent credit crunches. This is
a key lesson of past financial crashes, manias and panics (Minsky (1986), Kindleberger (1978),
Rogoff and Reinhart (2009)). It was a lesson painfully re-taught to policymakers during the most
recent financial crisis.
This time’s credit cycle has been particularly severe and synchronous. In 2006, private sector credit
across the UK, US and euro area rose by around 10%. During 2009, private credit in these
countries fell by around 2%.1 The knock-on consequences for real growth were equally severe and
synchronous. Peak to trough, G7 real output fell by 3.6% during the Great Recession.
In response, there have been widespread calls for remedial policy action. These proposals come in
various stripes. Some have proposed a more active role for monetary policy in addressing financial
imbalances (Taylor (2010), White (2009)). Others have suggested using new macro-prudential
tools to rein in credit excesses (Borio and Lowe (2002), Bank of England (2009), Kashyap et al
(2010)). Others still have proposed a radical root-and-branch reform of the structure of banking
(Kay (2009), Kotlikoff (2010)).
Evaluating the merits of these proposals requires a conceptual understanding of the causes of the
credit cycle and an empirical quantification of its dynamic behaviour. What is the underlying
friction generating credit booms and busts? Are credit cycles distinct from cycles in the real
economy? And how have they evolved, both over time and across countries? Answers to these
questions should help frame public policy choices for curbing the credit cycle.
To fix ideas, Section 2 sketches a model of the credit cycle. In this model, a lack of information
provides incentives for banks to expand their balance sheets to boost profits and signal their ability
to investors. This gives rise to a coordination failure, as banks collectively risk-up. That, in turn,
generates a systematic credit boom and subsequent bust when risk is realised.
Sections 3 and 4 present some empirical evidence on the credit cycle. Across countries and across a
sweep of history, credit cycles are both clearly identifiable and regular. Typically, they presage

2

banking crises. In their frequency and amplitude, credit cycles are distinct from the business cycle.
There is also evidence of them arising from coordination failures, which generate spillover effects
across banks and countries.
Drawing on this evidence, Section 5 identifies some implications for the design of public policy. It
suggests that neither monetary nor micro-prudential policy may be well-equipped to tackle the
credit cycle. Instead, some new policy apparatus may be needed which (unlike monetary policy)
targets bank balance sheets directly but which (unlike micro-prudential policy) does so
systematically. This is one key dimension of so-called macro-prudential policy.2
Various international macro-prudential policy committees are, or are about to be, put in place – in
the US the Financial Stability Oversight Committee, in the euro-area the European Systemic Risk
Board and in the UK the Financial Policy Committee. These provide one element of a macroprudential policy framework. Other elements remain to be put in place. Knowledge of the sources
and dynamics of the credit cycle will be important in assembling those missing pieces. This paper
is intended to be a contribution towards that goal.
2. A Model of the Credit Cycle
We begin by sketching a model which captures some key features of past, and in particular the
present, credit cycle. There are a number of existing models of the credit, or leverage, cycle. In all
of these models, cyclicality in financial variables is aggravated by various micro-economic
frictions. These frictions typically then amplify fluctuations in the real economy. Broadly, these
models can be classified according to the underlying micro-economic friction.
For example, a well-established body of literature has looked at the effects of asymmetric
information between borrowers and lenders in placing limits on credit (Bernanke, Gertler and
Gilchrist (1996), Holstrom and Tirole (1997)). These constraints can be loosened by the borrower
pledging collateral to the lender, in effect as a substitute for information (Kiyotaki and Moore
(1997)). This solves one problem, but at the potential expense of another: movements in the prices
of collateral then have the potential to aggravate cycles in leverage and credit (Geanakoplos
(2010)). These cycles can in turn act as a “financial accelerator” for the business cycle. These are
typically models of a representative bank and credit-constrained investor.
2

There are other potential non-cyclical instruments of macro-prudential policy, including instruments to tackle

systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).

3

A second potential source of credit market friction arises from coordination failures among lenders
(Gorton and He (2008)). In these models, banks are heterogeneous and their behaviour strategic.
The individually rational actions of heterogeneous lenders can generate collectively sub-optimal
credit provision in both the upswing (a credit boom) and the downswing (a credit crunch), perhaps
through herding (Acharya (2009), Acharya and Yorulmazer (2008)). This is the result of a
collective action, or co-ordination, problem among banks.
In credit markets, these co-ordination failures are far from new. Keynes memorably noted:
“A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when
he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way with his fellows, so that no
one can really blame him” (Keynes (1931)).
Eighty years later, Chuck Prince, then-CEO of Citibank, captured the collective action problem
thus:
“As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing”
(Prince (2006)).
As Prince’s quote attests, these incentives were a key driver of risk-taking behaviour in the run-up
to the crisis. In the face of stiffening competition, banks were increasingly required to keep pace
with the returns on equity offered by their rivals – a case not so much of “keeping up with the
Joneses” as “keeping up with the Goldmans”. To achieve these higher returns, it was individually
rational for banks to increase their risk profiles. They did so in various ways including through
higher leverage, marked to market gains on trading books and writing contracts with deep out-ofthe-money option payoffs (Alessandri and Haldane (2009)).
These strategies had the desired effect. They generated high and synchronous reported returns
(Chart 1). But they did so at the expense of higher risk in aggregate – a case of a competitive coordination failure. Reported returns were, in this sense, risk illusory. As those risk illusions were
shattered, all of the pre-crisis gains in banks’ reported returns were lost. Our model captures the
spirit of these dynamics, with short-run risk-taking to preserve reputation and boost returns (a credit
boom) in time giving way to longer-term collective costs when the music ceases (a credit crunch).

2.1 The set up
We develop a simple framework, in the spirit of Rajan (1994), to capture these collective action
failures. Rajan’s (op.cit.) model generates multiple equilibria. We use a version of the Morris and
Shin (2003) ‘global games’ framework to pin down a unique equilibrium for the coordination game
among banks, which then allows an evaluation of policy options.3
The set up is as follows. Each period there is a continuum of agents, indexed by

0,1 , all of

whom work as financial intermediaries for a single period. In other words, bankers have, by
assumption, short horizons. They aim to maximise their reputation in the market at the end of this
period. 4 At the beginning of each period, each bank originates a risky asset, the return on which
3

For other applications of the “global games” framework to banking, see inter alia, Rochet and Vives (2004) and
Goldstein and Pauzner (2005). Broadly speaking, these models use the framework to pin down uniqueness in the
coordination game played by the depositors of fragile banks, a la Diamond and Dybvig (1983). For a survey of
coordination games in macroeconomics, see Cooper (1999) and Morris and Shin (2000).

Individuals might receive intrinsic utility from being thought of as high ability, or it might matter materially if future
job prospects (including wages) depend on current reputation (see Scharfstein and Stein (1990)). The threat of corporate
takeovers might also generate shortened managerial horizons, or agents might engage in hyperbolic discounting, which
generates a short-term bias.

5

depends on (i) the banker’s ability, which can be high or low, and (ii) the macro state, which can be
good or bad. Both are unobservable to the market.
The macro state is good with probability . High bank ability and a good macro state increase the
probability of positive asset returns. That is, when the macro state is bad, assets turn out to be bad,
irrespective of bankers’ ability. But when the macro state is good, both high and low ability
bankers achieve high returns with some probability, with high ability types always achieving high
returns and low ability types achieving high returns with probability

1.

Asset returns are realised in the middle of each period and are observed only by banks. If the asset
is good, banks make a profit (normalised to be a negligible amount). If the asset is bad, banks face
a loss of -1. Because of their short horizons, bankers care about both the present value of their asset
returns and their reputation in the market, where is the probability assigned by the market to a
banker being high ability.
The market is unable to observe banks’ actions directly, so instead infers bankers’ ability from
observed bank earnings. Banks’ earnings are affected by their choices when returns are low. If an
asset turns out to be bad, banks can hide negative earnings in the short run by engaging in risky
policies to boost returns – in effect, engaging in risk illusion. When a bank engages in a risky
policy, an immediate loss is avoided with probability . But risky policies always involve longer
term expected losses of

.

If instead of setting risky policies banks choose immediately to liquidate assets, they set a tight
policy, realising a loss of -1 for sure. So banks’ choices when faced with low asset returns
determine their risk profiles. If returns are low, under a risky policy banks can increase short term
earnings with some positive probability, but must incur a long term loss; while under a tight policy,
banks can accept low short term earnings for sure now, avoiding losses in the future.
Suppose banks attach weight

0,1 to their reputation in the market and 1

to the net present

value of future profits. When the asset is good, banks earn a return normalised to zero. When the
asset is bad, two strategies are possible. If a bank chooses a risky (superscript ) policy, it obtains

When the loan is bad, setting a tight (superscript ) policy yields

as the probability of a loss is unity under a tight policy and the bank obtains reputation

7

, .

The evolution of reputation is key for determining behavioural dynamics in the model. The
marginal effect on reputation of banks adopting risky rather than tight policies is given by
,

We posit

,

, ,

0: improvements in the macro state increase the incentive banks face to liberalise

their risk management policies. When the macro state is good, any negative earnings are more
likely to be attributed to low ability. This is the “Prince constraint”. A concern for reputation
incentivises banks to seek risky ventures (to keep dancing), the more so the better is the market’s
prior on the macro state (the louder the music).
We also posit

0: as a larger proportion of banks set risky credit policies, the larger the incentive

to pursue similarly risky policies. When others are posting positive earnings, the reputational loss
from foreclosing and taking losses is that much greater. This is the “Keynes constraint”. It is better
for your reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.
These conditions generate the potential for credit booms and busts. The better is the macro state,
the greater banks’ incentive to pursue risky projects to preserve reputation, as the market attributes
low earnings to low ability. But one bank’s announcement of positive earnings encourages others
to announce positive earnings by setting risky policies too. In Rajan’s model this strategic
complementarity between banks generates multiple equilibria: in sufficiently good states, banks
coordinate on risky policies (“credit booms”), while in bad states they coordinate on tight policies
(“credit crunches”). In between, either equilibrium is possible.

We assume no discounting, as in Rajan (1994). The qualitative results would not change were we to consider it.

2.2 The model in a ‘global game’
Next, we apply the technology of Morris and Shin (2003) to define a unique equilibrium from this
game. Assume that banks observe fundamentals with some small amount of noise, with bank
receiving signal
,

where the noise terms

are distributed in the population with continuous density

on the real line. Our model satisfies the conditions set out in Morris and Shin (2003) for there to
exist a unique equilibrium in this game. In particular, each bank's strategy
signal satisfies

,

{Risky} when in receipt of a high signal exceeding some critical level

. The condition determining this threshold

is (see Appendix)

.

8

Condition (1) allows us to perform comparative statics on the unique coordination equilibrium.
Using (1) it follows that the threshold level of fundamentals above which banks set risky policies is
(a) increasing in the long-term cost of extending bad credit , and (b) decreasing in relative
reputational concerns , or

/

0,

/

0.

Both results accord with intuition. First, increasing the cost to banks of pursuing risky strategies
causes banks to coordinate on risky policies only at very high levels of fundamentals. Or, put
differently, safety prevails over a larger range of fundamentals when risky policies are costly.
Prudential policies (discussed further in Section 5) are one means of raising the cost to banks of
pursuing such risky strategies.
These prudential policies would have both direct effects and strategic effects in the model. A rise in
long term costs raises the direct cost to bank of adopting a risky strategy. But it also leads bank
to expect fewer other banks to adopt risky policies. So a rise in c has both a direct effect on banks’
actions and an effect through banks’ expectations of others’ actions.8 This expectational channel is
crucial from a policy perspective.
Second, reputational concerns act in the opposite direction. As greater weight is placed on shortterm reputation, incentives are sharpened to signal high ability by pursuing risky policies, even
when their signalling effect is relatively small ( is low). As in Rajan (1994), a tight credit policy
becomes optimal for all levels of fundamentals as

0, or as reputational concerns vanish.

Conversely, if increased competition and deregulation increase reputational concerns, this increases
the propensity of the system to periodic credit booms and subsequent busts.
2.3 Dynamics
This model can generate credit cycles which amplify cycles in the real economy relative to a world
without credit cycle frictions.9 Without frictions, bad loans are liquidated immediately, allowing
new assets to be originated next period to unencumbered borrowers. By contrast, extending credit
to bad risks eventually results in balance sheet impairment for both borrowers and lenders.

8

These expectation effects are necessarily intra-temporal in our model. The actual operation of macro-prudential
policy may well have effects through inter-temporal expectations as well. See Section 5 below.

9

The property that global games generate endogenous cycles in dynamic settings has been analysed in, inter alia,
Steiner (2006) and Giannitsarou and Toxvaerd (2007).

9

We perform a simple simulation to illustrate these dynamics. Suppose the macro state moves
stochastically around its trend as a result of a sequence of iid productivity shocks. The macro state
is mean-reverting as long as banks set tight policies when they realise low asset returns. This
occurs when reputational effects are switched off (

0 .

Next suppose reputational concerns are introduced, leading banks to risk up to signal high ability.
Because of strategic complementarities, banks do this whenever

. This leads to subsequent

impairment of the borrowing sector. These dynamics are captured in the simple specification

dynamics of

begin also to shape the real economy.

The distribution of

is assumed to have a higher mean and variance than

of the credit boom. In particular, we constrain the distribution of

to simulate the effects

relative to

such that expected

risk-adjusted fundamentals are constant over time.10 So we have, in effect, a regime-switching
model. When banks play safe strategies, fundamentals are relatively stable. When banks risk up,
they create a temporary improvement in expected fundamentals at the cost of greater volatility.
If fundamentals evolve according to (2), and bankers at time know this, past fundamentals act as
public signals. Morris and Shin (2003) show that when past fundamentals are observed with
sufficient noise, the global game described above continues to have a unique equilibrium. If
fundamentals were high yesterday, bankers know that fundamentals are likely to be high today.
Intuitively, this makes them more likely to choose the risky policy. In the annex, we sketch the
in the public

public signal game and find its equilibrium. We show that, when the threshold is
signal game, we have that

/

0 as long as the public signal contains information for the

bankers. When this information disappears, the threshold becomes independent of past
fundamentals (see Annex 1(b)). In addition, it continues to be the case that

In particular, the Sharpe ratio (the expected value of fundamentals relative to their standard deviation) is constant
across both regimes.

10

/

0, such that higher costs of risk taking and lower reputational concerns decrease the

probability of risky policies being adopted.
This dynamic specification has some interesting properties. First, even small shocks can have
disproportionately large effects on fundamentals depending on the initial conditions. In particular,
if fundamentals happen to be close to the switching threshold, a further positive shock will lead all
firms to coordinate on the high risk-taking strategy. That drives up both the expected value of
fundamentals and its volatility. This generates a form of path dependence. Second, credit cycles
are endogenous in this framework. As firms coordinate on high risk strategies, this drives up the
expected value of fundamentals. But it also drives up volatility due to risk illusion. Because riskadjusted returns are constant, this must entail an increase in the probability of there being a severe
negative shock, so the probability of a crash rises. Third, when past fundamentals are observed with
sufficient accuracy, improvements in outturns can signal trouble ahead. It becomes more likely,
then, that bankers will coordinate on the risk taking equilibrium.
Chart 2 shows a simulation of the model when

0.5 for 100 periods with

normally distributed shocks. The frictionless benchmark model generates the path shown by the
maroon line. As specified, the path is mean reverting, with movements in the macro state around
trend. Allowing for reputational effects generates the blue path, giving a threshold level of
fundamentals

shown by the green dashed line. As the macro state hits the threshold, banks adopt

risky policies to signal high ability. In this simulation this happens four times, in periods 3, 50, 68
and 72.
Consider the threshold breach in period 72. As during the Great Moderation, the good macro state
at first persists. The credit boom fuels high fundamentals. But while headline fundamentals have
improved, risk-adjusted fundamentals have not. Eventually, this results in a crunch in credit and a
sharp deterioration in the macro state, as risk is realised.
Now suppose that financial liberalisation generates heightened competition between banks,
increasing the market premium on reputation. This raises the value of in the model. Chart 3
shows the effects of the reputational weight being raised

0.3 . The threshold for risky policies

falls. Relative to the baseline, there is an additional large and persistent boom in the middle of the
simulation, followed by a period of below counterfactual fundamentals. The path of the economy is
more volatile, with deviations from trend larger and more persistent. In other words, the credit
cycle has real and adverse consequences.

2.4 Empirical implications
Several empirical implications follow from the model. First, strategic complementarities
incentivise banks to adopt risky strategies in a coordinated fashion during the boom. So the

12

dynamics of the model predict that we should observe cycles in financial activity at a macroeconomic level. Initial productivity improvements are amplified into lending booms, which are
followed by credit busts and, potentially, crises. Second, at a micro-economic level, the
coordination of risky strategies during the boom should compress the dispersion of bank earnings,
as low ability banks masquerade as high ability banks during good times. But during the bust, when
the macro state turns bad, the dispersion of banks’ earnings should increase as low ability types
crystallise losses while high ability types do not. We turn next to the macro and micro evidence.
3. Credit Cycle Dynamics
To what extent are the macroeconomic credit cycle dynamics predicted by the model present in the
real world? To assess that, we draw on a dataset recently developed by Schularick and Taylor
(2009). This covers a lengthy time-series (often more than a century of data) across 12 developed
countries.11 It enables us to identify lower (than business cycle) frequency movements in credit,
just as Comin and Gertler (2006) do for post World War II US GDP.12 We concentrate on results
for the UK and US, though broadly similar patterns are evident for the other ten countries.
Table 1 presents some summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of real GDP growth, real
loan growth and real bank asset growth in the UK and the US since 1880.13 The sample is split into
four periods: 1880-1913; 1914-1945; 1945-79; and 1980-2008. Charts 4 and 5, meanwhile, plot
loan or asset to GDP ratios for the UK and US over the sample. Several features are clear:


Average real GDP growth is little changed either side of the wars (Table 1). But real credit
has grown around twice as quickly since 1945. In consequence, loan/GDP ratios trend
upwards from around 1945, consistent with financial liberalisation and deepening (Charts 4
and 5).

11

The countries covered are: Australia, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United States.
12

They argue that medium term cycles in GDP reflect persistent responses of real activity to the high-frequency
fluctuations normally associated with the “business cycle” (Comin and Gertler, op. cit.). In this sense, there is a direct
analogy with our model, in which strategic complementarities in risk taking can generate persistent credit cycles in
response to high-frequency fluctuations in fundamentals.

13

The bank loans series consists of total domestic currency loans of banks and banking institutions to companies and
households, while the assets series consists of total domestic currency assets of banks and banking institutions. For a
full description of the data and its sources, see Schularick and Taylor (2009), Appendix B.

13



The same general pattern is evident in the volatilities of output and credit. The variability of
real GDP growth has, if anything, fallen in the period since 1945. The standard deviation of
real credit growth rose in the years immediately following 1945 and has remained above
those levels, especially since 1980.



Since 1945, the standard deviation of real credit growth has been around five times that of
real activity.

On the face of it, these summary statistics are consistent with credit dynamics being distinct from
GDP dynamics. It is possible to formalise this intuition by using filtering techniques to extract the
cycle in credit. To do so, we apply a band-pass filter to the data.14 This isolates the cyclical
component of a series operating in a frequency range specified by the user.15
We begin with estimates of the spectral density for real loan growth. Chart 6 plots one such
estimate, along with approximate 90% confidence bands.16 The peak in the density at a (normalised)
frequency of around 0.18 suggests a cycle with duration of around 11 years – a medium term cycle.
The smaller peak at around 0.45 corresponds to a business cycle frequency of around 4.5 years. The
relative size of these two peaks suggests that medium term fluctuations are an important source of
overall variation in real loan growth. But the limited sample length means that the confidence bands
around our estimated density are large.

14

We also experimented with the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Although the choice of an appropriate smoothing parameter
is not straightforward a priori, this approach produced broadly similar results to the band-pass filter. See e.g. Harvey
and Jaeger (1993) and Canova (1998) for discussions.
15

In what follows, we use Christiano and Fitzgerald’s (2003) optimal finite sample approximation to the band pass
filter. An alternative to Christiano and Fitzgerald’s procedure is provided by Baxter and King (1999). Christiano and
Fitzgerald provide evidence to suggest that their optimal finite sample approximation is preferable to Baxter and King’s
when extracting cycles at lower frequencies.) Suppose the time series in question is a stationary stochastic process
. The properties of the time series can be captured in
with expectation . Its auto-covariance is
the frequency domain by taking a Fourier transform of the auto-covariances yielding the power spectrum
1
2

,

where is the frequency (in radians) in the range
, (and
1 / ). Since the power spectrum is a function of the
auto-covariances (including the variance 0 ), it can be viewed as a decomposition of the variance of the time-series in
terms of frequency. When the power spectrum is normalised by the variance 0 , the resulting standardised function is
known as the spectral density. The filter then isolates ‘bands’ in the frequency domain of the spectral density and
returns the resulting series.

16

We estimate the spectral density by smoothing the sample periodogram using a Parzen window with lag truncation
parameter . We experimented with various values of . In general, this trades off the variance of the estimate of
with the bias. Higher values of entail less bias, but a greater variance and wider confidence intervals. The

Using the estimated spectral density to inform our search, Charts 7-8 show cyclical fluctuations in
real loan growth in the UK and US. Since the estimated density is subject to uncertainty, we
expand the frequency domain over which we plot the medium term cycle to 8-20 years. Consistent
with the estimated density, shorter-term, business cycle fluctuations, say between 2-8 years, were
typically not found to account for much of the overall cyclical variation in credit.17 In other words,
credit growth exhibits a clear cyclical pattern with a medium-term orientation. We estimate the
standard deviation of the 8-20 year cycle to be around 10%, with a 95% confidence interval of
[7.00%,12.8%].18 Hence the credit cycle appears to be a well-defined empirical regularity. It also
appears to have been operating for well over a century. And its frequency suggests factors other

If the series for the UK are detrended, business cycle frequency fluctuations in real loan growth explained around
10% of the overall variation in real loan growth, as measured by the coefficient of variation for this cycle. By contrast,
the medium term cycle explains around 30% of the variation in detrended real loans for the UK.

liberalisation and competition.

The credit cycle is distinct from the business cycle in amplitude as well as frequency. To show this,
Charts 7-8 plot the medium-term cycles in real GDP for the UK and US alongside the credit cycle.
The amplitude of the credit cycle is twice that of fluctuations in GDP over the medium term. It is
roughly five times that of fluctuations in GDP at conventional business cycle frequencies. The
peak-to-trough variation in the typical credit cycle has been around 20 percentage points in the UK.
For real GDP, it is around 10 percentage points. As a result, ratios of credit to GDP themselves
exhibit a distinct cyclical pattern in the UK and US (Charts 4-5).

The same broad patterns are evident in the data when moving from credit to asset (equity and
house) prices in the UK and US (Charts 9-10). A clear financial cycle is evident in both these
series, distinct from the typical business cycle in its amplitude as well as frequency. The peak to
trough variation in asset prices is, if anything, greater than for credit: around 40 percentage points
for equities and around 15 percentage points for house prices over medium-term horizons in the
UK. Charts 11 and 12 demonstrate those differences, plotting medium-term frequency cycles in
GDP and asset prices in the UK and US since 1945.

In Annex 2 we show results for the other 10 countries, applying the same techniques to real GDP
and real credit. Although the cycles are sometimes not as regular, the same general cyclical patterns
in output and credit are present using the wider panel of countries. As Irving Fisher noted almost
eighty years ago:
“The old and apparently still persistent notion of “the” business cycle, as a single, simple,
self-generating cycle,…is a myth. Instead of one cycle, there are many co-existing
cycles, constantly aggravating or neutralising each other, as well as co-existing with
many non-cyclical forces” (Fisher (1933)).
Historically, the credit cycle appears to have been just such a phenomenon.
But why should we care? One reason might be that credit booms and busts are systematically
related to the incidence of crises, with their associated social costs. Using the filtered credit series
for the 12 countries, and the dating of banking and currency crises from Bordo et al (2001), it is
possible to test this hypothesis.19 Over the sample period, these countries were in a state of banking
and/or currency crisis anywhere between 10% and 25% of the time. This broadly matches the
frequency of the credit cycle.

We also used crisis dating from Lopez-Salido and Nelson (2010) for the US.

21

Table 3 asks what proportion of crisis years occurred within 5 years of the peak in the credit cycle
in those countries. On average, more than half of all financial crisis years across the 12 countries
appear to have been preceded by a credit boom. Among Anglo-Saxon countries, such as the US,
UK and Australia, closer to 75% of crisis years occurred following a credit boom. This is relatively
concrete evidence of the credit cycle having real and damaging effects on output.20,21

4. Credit Cycle Spillovers
This empirical evidence to date, operating at a macro-economic level, is consistent with the model
in Section 2: a credit cycle is clearly discernible; its frequency is different and its amplitude larger
than the business cycle; and its fluctuations may exacerbate the business cycle. But the model also
has implications at a micro-economic level, arising from strategic complementarities, or spillover
effects, across firms. In this section we consider empirical evidence on such credit spillover effects.
The model implies that the cross-sectional distribution of returns to banking should be compressed
during a credit boom, as banks seek to keep up with competitors by collectively boosting returns.
This is a time-series phenomenon. A second implication is that the dispersion in returns may be
smaller for financial than for non-financial companies to the extent that former are more susceptible
to risk illusion. This is a cross-sectional phenomenon.
To assess these hypotheses, Charts 13 and 14 look at the dispersion of returns for publicly listed US
banks calculated in two ways: implied market returns on bank equity and reported returns on
banks’ equity (ROE). For comparison, the dispersion of returns among the largest US non-financial
companies is also shown, together with identified periods of credit boom. Two features are striking.
First, measures of return dispersion are consistently lower for banks than for non-banks: simple
t-tests reject the null of equal mean dispersion between the two types of institution at the 1% level.
Given the much higher levels of leverage among banks than non-banks, that is surprising: high
20

We also conducted some probit regressions using lagged real credit growth to predict the probability of banking
crisis, following Schularick and Taylor (op.cit.). We replicated their results: lagged real credit growth (up to five or six
years) was jointly significant in positively contributing to the probability of there being a subsequent banking crisis, and
robust across sub-samples pre and post WWII. The joint significance of five-six annual lags of real credit growth is
consistent with our depiction of the credit cycles as a medium term phenomenon in which sustained booms are
statistically significantly related to banking crises.
21

See also Bordo and Haubrich (2010), who show that more severe financial events are associated with more severe
real effects in the US 1875—2007.

22

leverage should bias against finding lower dispersion in banking. It is consistent with stronger
herding incentives in banking.
Second, measures of return dispersion tend to fall during periods of credit boom, statistically
significantly so at the 1% level. For example, measures of equity return dispersion hit all-time lows
at the height of the recent credit boom in 2006-2007.22 At first sight this might seem to run counter
to the conventional wisdom that the correlation between asset prices tends to increase dramatically
during times of stress, while remaining muted in boom times. But our model suggests that there
may be strong behavioural incentives for banks to adopt highly correlated portfolios in the boom, as
low ability types attempt to masquerade as high ability types. Banks’ reported returns would then
move together, even when prices across a range of different asset classes might not. The dispersion
we find in the data in times of stress is a corollary of this. In the bust, low ability types get found
out, while high types differentiate themselves. Dispersion moves counter-cyclically.23
Charts 15 and 16 look at the same metrics for UK banks. We have also examined return patterns
among the largest global banking and non-financial firms.24 The results are much the same. On
average, the dispersion in banking returns is statistically significantly lower than for non-banks, at
the 1% level, both for UK and global institutions. And, in general, we observe a compression of
returns during credit booms and a dispersion in busts. There is evidence of an increase in the
degree of coordination of global banks’ activities after the financial liberalisation of the 1980s. This
suggests credit cycles may have become increasingly synchronous globally.

22

There are, of course, alternative explanations. See, for example, Gomes, Kogan and Zhang (2003), whose model
predicts counter cyclical dispersion driven by productivity shocks. Our explanation differs both in that (a) we relate
dispersion to lower frequency fluctuations in fundamentals than the business cycle and (b) we stress imperfect
information, and in particular the incentive to convey type, which is absent in their model.
23

Counter-cyclical variation in equity return volatility is well documented in the finance literature. There may be a link
between this and our concern with counter-cyclical dispersion. Our model suggests that the desire to signal ability,
rooted in imperfect information and short horizons, may be a cause of counter-cyclical dispersion in banking returns.
The crises generated by excessive risk taking in our model would generate heightened volatility in a time series sense.
Empirically, Schwert (1989) finds no single macroeconomic variable that can explain low frequency movements in
equity price volatility. Further evidence is provided in Hamilton and Lin (1996), Perez Quiros and Timmerman (2001),
Brandt and Kang (2004) and Belratti and Morana (2006). These econometric studies leave the structural causes of
counter-cyclical volatility unexplained. Theoretical explanations have been put forward by, among others, Campbell
and Cochrane (1999) and Mele (2007), who show that habits and cyclically asymmetric risk premia respectively may
generate counter cyclical volatility in asset pricing models. Ours relies on excessive risk taking in a world of imperfect
information.

24

This global group of banking institutions included UK and US banks as a subset.

23

To test this formally, we construct pair-wise correlations between countries’ credit cycles for two
post-war sub-samples, 1945-79 and 1980-2008. We plot the cumulative distributions of these
cross-country correlations in Chart 17. The same technique can be applied to correlations between
countries’ medium term fluctuations in GDP (Chart 18). In each chart, a shift to the right of the
cumulative distribution indicates an increase in the degree of cross-country correlation.

Consistent with Bordo and Helbling (2003, 2010), there is evidence of increasing synchronicity in
medium term GDP fluctuations across countries since 1980: a Wilcoxon rank-sum test rejects the
null that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution at the 1% level and Jenrich’s test
rejects the null that the correlation matrices are equal.25,26 This increased synchronisation can be
explained by increasing trade and financial liberalisation (see Bordo and Helbling (op. cit.)).
We observe an analogous pattern for credit cycles, with the correlation between countries’ credit
cycles higher on average after 1980. The Wilcoxon test rejects the null of equality at the 5% level
and Jenrich’s rejects its null at the 1% level. This is consistent with the notion that global banks’
activities have become increasingly alike, possibly as a result of increased competition and crossborder lending. The increase in the cross-country correlation of the credit cycle suggests policy
needs an international dimension if it is to curb effectively the credit cycle, to which we turn next.

25

Wilcoxon’s test pools the correlation matrices from the two sub samples and ranks individual country-pair
observations by magnitude. If one set of observations features systematically higher cross-correlations, the rank of each
of the observations will be higher on average in the pooled sample. Using the rankings of each correlation in the pooled
sample, a normally distributed test statistic is constructed, under the null that the two samples are drawn from the same
distribution.

26

Jennrich’s test for the equality of two correlation matrices derives a chi-squared distributed test statistic from
transformations of the correlation matrices, including a term correcting for the bounded support ([-1,1]) of the
difference between two correlations. The null is equality of the matrices.

5. Curbing the Credit Cycle
Taking together the evidence from Sections 2-4, what are the implications for public policy?
First, according to the model a credit cycle arises from a collective action failure among banks. The
lending decisions banks take, while individually rational, are collectively sub-optimal. Specifically,
individual banks may fail to internalise the reputational externalities their lending actions impose on
others. The result is a periodic tidal wave of credit during the boom followed by protracted credit
drought during the crunch. Chuck Prince’s disco inferno causes murder on the dance floor.
These credit cycle externalities provide a justification for state intervention to help co-ordinate
lending expectations and actions by banks. At least in principle, these externalities suggest a role
for the state in enforcing collective lending action, to curb the peaks and troughs in the credit cycle.
The case for policy action may have grown over recent decades as competition in banking, and
associated externalities, have intensified.
Second, it has been suggested that one means of curbing credit cycle frictions is through monetary
policy – either by ensuring it moderates appropriately the business cycle (Taylor (2010)) or, more
ambitiously, by having it play a wider role in curtailing financial imbalances (Borio and White
(2004)). The evidence presented here is not especially encouraging on that front. The frequency
and amplitude of the business and credit cycles is quite different. Monetary policy may be an
inefficient tool for calming the credit cycle, if at the same time it is to moderate the business cycle.
Recent history offers a good case study. Between 2000 and 2007, UK nominal GDP growth
exhibited no signs of exuberance, with GDP growth at trend and inflation at target. Over the same
period, UK banks’ balance sheets trebled. Using monetary policy to tame credit growth over this
period would have come at the expense of a destabilisation of non-financial activity. Activist
monetary policy would have resulted in instability migrating from the financial to the non-financial
sector. In tackling the credit cycle, monetary policy may have, in Irving Fisher’s language,
“aggravated rather than neutralised” the business cycle.
Econometric evidence tends to support this view. Model-based simulations by the IMF suggest the
need for two instruments to tackle efficiently real as well as financial imbalances (IMF (2009)).
And the empirical evidence in Bean et al (2010) suggests that monetary policy may be a rather

28

ineffective instrument quantitatively in constraining credit growth. This suggests that assigning
monetary policy the task of tackling financial imbalances may be inefficient, perhaps ineffective.
Charts 19 and 20 plot credit cycles in the UK and US from 1880, together with the different
monetary policy regimes which have operated over this period. Strikingly, credit cycles dynamics
appear to be largely invariant to the monetary policy regime – fixed or floating, rules or discretion,
lax or tight. This, too, is indicative evidence that monetary policy may not be the most effective
tool for moderating credit fluctuations.

Third, micro-prudential policy aimed at tackling financial imbalances in individual financial
institutions may also be ineffective for dealing with aggregate credit cycles. That is because bankspecific actions will not, by themselves, internalise the spillovers that arise across banks over the
credit cycle. At best, this means that micro-prudential actions may be impotent in curbing the credit
cycle. At worst, however, it could mean that bank-specific prudential actions are counterproductive. They might actually boost risk-taking incentives among banks which are not subject to
prudential intervention.
To see that, consider a two-bank variant of the model described by the payoffs in Table 4, in which
now references the market’s prior over the macro state, which it updates having observed a
bank’s earnings. When

1

γ /γ is neither too big nor too small, there are two symmetric

Nash equilibrium strategies in this game: {Risky, Risky} and {Tight, Tight}. When Bank 1 sets
{Risky}, Bank 2 does not want to set {Tight} and declare negative earnings as this is more likely to
signal low ability, provided the long term costs are not too big. On the other hand, if Bank 1 sets

30

{Tight}, Bank 2 sets tight too if long term costs are not too small. This results in a classic
coordination game with multiple equilibria.

Now suppose the regulator forces Bank 2 to set tight policies whenever it realises low returns. So if
Bank 2 announces positive earnings, it must be because the macro state is good. But given this,
Bank 1 does not want to signal low ability by playing {Tight} when it makes a bad loan since doing
so would be taken by the market to imply low ability. If the spillover from Bank 2’s actions to the
market’s assessment of the macro state is strong enough, {Tight, Tight} may no longer be an
equilibrium. Instead, Bank 1 may play Risky. The resulting equilibrium is {Risky, Tight}. In this
way, bank-specific intervention may have perverse consequences for risk-taking.
Fourth, this co-ordination problem suggests systematic, across-the-system actions are needed to
curtail effectively credit booms and busts. This is one dimension of macro-prudential policy. To be
effective, these policies need to increase the long-term cost of credit extension to banks during
booms and, as importantly, to lower these costs during busts. These actions would help smooth out
credit supply over the cycle. There are a variety of macro-prudential tools which could have this
effect, including pro-cyclical capital and liquidity requirements, or remuneration packages that tie
individual earnings more closely to long term performance (Bank of England (2009), Kashyap et al
(2010), G30 (2010)).
Chart 21 illustrates the impact of increasing the long term cost of short term risky strategies, ,
across the entire system in our simple model. The ‘low ’ and frictionless paths are identical to
Chart 2. But if the regulator raises the cost of risky policies, the signalling threshold rises to the
green dashed line. In this example, the increase in this threshold is sufficient to prevent risky
policies arising at any point over the horizon. In other words, the ‘high ’ (macro-prudential) path

31

replicates the frictionless equilibrium. The large output swings caused by risky lending cycles are
reduced significantly. The financial accelerator is defused.

Fifth, because credit cycles emerge from a failure to co-ordinate lending decisions, expectations are
crucial for the effectiveness of macro-prudential policies. Perhaps even more than in a monetary
policy context, macro-prudential policy works by acting on agents’ expectations. For example,
raising has a direct effect on lenders’ behaviour, increased incentives to reduce risk. But as
importantly, it also has an indirect expectational effect, as all lenders anticipate they will become
subject to the same simultaneous squeeze. Anticipating that, lenders will co-ordinate their lending
choices today provided policy is credible.
These collective action dynamics underscore the importance of the expectations channel for macroprudential policy. This has important implications for the design of a macro-prudential framework.
Without absolute clarity about the objectives of any macro-prudential policy framework and the
policy rule necessary to deliver these objectives, expectations will not adjust and policy will be
impotent. Any lack of transparency or failure of communications is likely to inhibit seriously the
effectiveness of macro-prudential policy.

32

Sixth, because macro-prudential policy is new in most developed countries, there are
understandable concerns that policymakers’ knowledge of the transmission mechanism of policy is
incomplete and imperfect. The model of the credit cycle developed here offers some grounds for
optimism. Signalling is the key transmission channel. Quantitative estimates of the effects of, for
example, higher capital ratios on banks’ cost of credit provision have wide confidence intervals
(BIS (2010)). But this may not be fatal if macro-prudential policy by-passes these channels and
works by acting, first and foremost, through expectations.
Seventh, the credit cycle is increasingly an international phenomenon, as well as a national one.
Credit spillovers occur across borders as well as across banks. This suggests macro-prudential
policies need also to have an international dimension if they are to tackle credit externalities. This
is recognised in the macro-prudential policy framework currently being discussed by the
international regulatory community (BIS (2010)). This framework includes an explicit reciprocity
provision. For example, judgements on local credit conditions determine the amounts of capital to
be held by international banks on their exposures in those countries. This reciprocity feature should
help to reduce the arbitrage risks posed by the internationalisation of the credit cycle.
Eighth, a second potential source of regulatory arbitrage is the shadow banking system. Even ahead
of the present crisis, this had grown to a scale potentially in excess of the conventional banking
system (Adrian et al (2010)). Operating macro-prudential policy on a sub-set of credit providers,
ignoring the shadow banks, suffers the same problems as micro-prudential policy operating on a
sub-set of banks. It risks not only being ineffective, but also providing incentives for risk to migrate
to the unregulated sector. This underlines the importance of policing the regulatory boundary and
moving this boundary if credit provision risks crossing the border in the course of setting macroprudential policy.
Ninth, especially at the outset, uncertainties about the role and efficacy of macro-prudential policy
will be considerable. Simplicity and humility will be needed. Simplicity to prevent confusion
about the objectives and transmission channels for macro-prudential policy, given the importance of
signalling. Humility to reduce the chances of banks over-relying on public policy signals about
credit provision at a time when these are sure to be noisy (see Morris and Shin (2002)). As with the
business cycle and monetary policy, macro-prudential policy cannot be expected to eliminate the
credit cycle. This is neither feasible nor desirable. And simple rules, augmented by judgement,

33

offer the best chance of ensuring robust decision-making at the start of a new macro-prudential
policy regime (Taylor and Williams (2010)).
Tenth, the state of macro-prudential policy today has many similarities with the state of monetary
policy just after the second world war. Data is incomplete, theory patchy, policy experience
negligible. Monetary policy then was conducted by trial and error. The same will be true of macroprudential policy now. Mistakes will be made. But as experience with the other arms of
macroeconomic policy has taught us, the biggest mistake would be not to try.

bad, all bankers achieve zero returns. Let be the probability that the macro state is good. Let the
