This technical appendix goes through the details of three points in the main body of the speech: the extent
to which flexible pay can account for the productivity shortfall; why (and how) the behaviour of relative prices
tells you about losses due to slow reallocation of resources (specifically capital); the sensitivity of optimal
policy to unemployment and output growth when both are noisy indicators of the “output gap”.
Flexible pay and productivity
The point that productivity is more cyclical when real pay is flexible can be represented with a simple labour
demand and supply diagram. For the demand side suppose there’s a representative firm that uses CES
production with an elasticity of substitution σ. For given output y and a real product wage w its demand for
labour is l = y – (1-σ)a – σw, where a is TFP and all the variables are in logs. Thus, along any given demand
curve, (log) labour productivity is y – l = σw + (1-σ)a.
Lower output shifts this demand curve to the left.
This might be caused by shift in TFP (the “a” term),
which will itself lower output. But it’s also possible
that y falls independently of a, thanks to a pure
demand shock. The Chart represents such a shift
and compares two cases: one with a relatively flat
labour supply curve (inflexible pay), one where it’s
steep (flexible pay). In the second case, real pay w
will fall further and measured productivity, even for
given TFP, will be lower. The size of the difference is
σΔw, where Δw is the extent to which real wages are
lower than they otherwise would have been.
While they don’t give a precise estimate, Pessoa and Van Reenen (2013) say that real pay has become
more flexible since earlier recessions, and is up to 2% weaker (all else equal) as a result. They then assume
σ = 1 (Cobb-Douglas production) and conclude that flexible pay can account for 2% of the measured drop in
productivity, relative to past downturns.
My own view is that the effect is smaller. First, a reasonable estimate for the UK suggests σ is around onehalf, not one (see, for example, Ellis and Price (2003)). Second, it’s not clear that real wages are, in fact, that
much lower, given the rate of unemployment, than one might have expected prior to the downturn (see Chart
6 in Broadbent (2012(b)). Third, the maintained hypothesis here is that the entire decline in output is, by
assumption, the result of lower aggregate demand, rather than a shift in effective supply (the a term). In
other words it’s possible that as much as 1% point of the productivity shortfall is the result of more flexible
pay and a purely demand-driven downturn (σ times the 2% difference in real wages). But it could also be
that the drop in output and wages are themselves the consequences of a drop in effective supply (the a

term). Especially if you regard the Δw = 2% figure as a little high, the 1% implied hit to productivity should be
as a ceiling, not a central estimate.
Reallocation, lost productivity and the variance of prices
Imagine a firm that uses inputs K and L to produce
Suppose we increase its employment by

and that the price of its output is

.

, holding fixed the other input K. Then the (base-weighted) value

of its output will change by
∫

(1)

where a zero superscript indicates the starting value and

the marginal product of labour. We want to think
∑

about what happens to the change in aggregate output

when shifts in relative demand are met

by changes in labour alone. In doing so we assume there is a fixed supply of labour in aggregate (call it L)
and that the labour market clears. The first condition means ∑

. The second means there a common

wage w, across all sectors, and that firms are on their labour demand curve
(2)
To work out the effect of a reallocation of labour on aggregate output note that the first-order approximation
to the integral in (1) is
[

∫

]

(3)

where the last term follows from (2). So, aggregating (1) and substituting from (3), the proportionate change
in productivity is
∑ [

]

(

)

(4)

where α is the share of wages in national income (wL/Y) and λi is employment in sector i relative to the
average. Note that, of the three terms in square brackets, the first two aggregate to zero because the wage
(and its change) are common to all sectors, so can be taken out of the summation, and we have restricted
∑

.

The share of wages in GDP is roughly two-thirds. So this relationship says the loss in productivity is (to a
first-order approximation) one third the cross-sectoral covariance between inflation and size-weighted
employment growth.

Further approximating the relationship between price and employment growth from (2), and using σ as the
elasticity of substitution between capital and labour in sector i, and

as the share of labour income in that

sector, one can re-express this in terms of prices alone:
(

where

)

(√

and

)

(5)

is the same quantity for the economy as a whole. Empirical estimates suggest

that whole-economy σ is around a half and α two-thirds. On that basis αμ is one and the loss of productivity
will be around one half the cross-sectoral variance of (μ-weighted) inflation. This is the relationship we used
in the main text.
A few more points:
First, if their derivation is a bit fiddly the intuition behind these relationships is relatively straightforward: if
sectors where demand and employment grow (shrink) also see price increases (falls) – i.e. the sectoral
supply curves slope upwards – then we know that marginal costs (

) have become dispersed and

aggregate productivity is lower as a result.
Second, other than the assumption that labour demand curves are well defined, there are no restrictions
here on production functions: they don’t need to be the same in all sectors, nor even do they need to exhibit
constant returns to scale (CRS). But: if there are constant returns, and if capital too is mobile, then relative
prices don’t change in response to demand shocks (relative supply curves are flat) and productivity is
invariant to shifts in relative demand.
To see this note that CRS means we can write marginal products in any sector i solely in terms of the
capital:labour ratio (call that
): defining the function g as
, we have
,
and

. So, under full factor mobility, and for given factor prices r and w, the two

first-order conditions for optimal employment of labour
to solve for the two variables

and

: the scale of production

) and capital

are enough

doesn’t matter for prices.

Third, note that I’ve assumed throughout that the production functions are constant: all we’re doing is
simulating pure (cross-sectoral) demand shocks, and the formula for lost productivity (roughly one half the
cross-sectoral variance of prices) depends on this assumption. But if there were such things as TFP shocks,
at a sectoral level, these would obviously have effects on relative prices too. By the same token they would
also have a (more direct) impact on aggregate TFP.

Extracting a signal about the output gap from noisy growth, unemployment
We begin with a general result due to Svensson and Woodford (2002). They analyse how optimal policy, in a
general linear model of the economy, with quadratic preferences, is affected by incomplete information about
economically relevant variables, in particular the “output gap”. They demonstrate that the sensitivity of policy
to the estimate of the output gap is invariant to its degree of accuracy. Specifically, suppose that, when you
know the output gap x with complete certainty, optimal policy involves some reaction function akin to a Taylor
rule:

If you then introduce some noise into the observation of x, the optimal policy is just
̂
where ̂ is the best possible estimate of the output gap. Everything else, including the sensitivity parameter
β, is the same as in the complete-information case. This means the relative sensitivities of optimal policy to
employment and output growth are the same as in the formula for ̂.
We now turn, in a particular (and very simple) setting, to what that “signal extraction” formula looks like. The
economy has an output gap x subject to persistent demand shocks d, unemployment u that depends on a
distributed lag of x and a white-noise disturbance u*, and output growth that’s (by definition) a combination of
changes in the output gap and an underlying supply shock, also assumed to be white noise, Δs (Δ denotes
the change in a variable so s itself is a random walk). Thus:
(1)
(2)
(3)
The standard deviations of the variances of the three shocks are σd, σu and σs respectively. We observe Δy
and u. Our task is to find the best possible estimate of x.
The easiest way to do this is to re-express (1)-(3) in state space form and use a Kalman filter. So the state
variables are x and its lagged value and evolve according to the state equation
