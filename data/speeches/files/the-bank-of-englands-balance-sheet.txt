Introduction
1

We have just experienced the biggest global financial crisis in history. The United Kingdom –

like many of the most advanced economies – is now emerging from the worst recession for at least a
generation. The response from the authorities, across the world, has been substantial and wideranging. Today, I want to focus on the Bank of England’s operations during the crisis and their
implications for our balance sheet. The ability of the Bank to influence the economy through its
actions in financial markets should be of profound interest to the pensions industry, both in terms of
our objective of restoring nominal spending growth so as to hit the inflation target, and in terms of the
immediate implications for financial asset prices.
2

We think the best way to understand the Bank’s operations is to take our balance sheet as an

organising framework. I hope that I can convince you of that today, especially since this audience is
better placed than most to understand a balance sheet approach!
3

The Bank’s balance sheet enables us to fulfill our core purposes, which are to promote and

maintain monetary and financial stability. My focus today will be on what we call the Sterling
Monetary Framework or SMF. This is the means by which the Bank implements monetary policy, and
offers liquidity insurance to the banking system.
4

I want to make one point clear up front. The SMF has to control the amount of money in the

economy consistent with monetary policy objectives. The liquidity insurance operations also provide
temporary, short-term liquidity assistance to commercial banks (and building societies – but for the
rest of this talk I will just refer to commercial banks for the sake of brevity). That support helps to
minimise disruptions to the liquidity and payments services which commercial firms offer to the
economy. What our framework cannot do is provide medium-term funding to the banking sector to
support their lending activities. It would take too long to explore this argument fully today, but you
might like to think of it this way: given that we have to control the amount of money in the system to
target inflation, the Bank has to be able to both put liquidity into the system and take it out again,
whenever that proves necessary. So the Bank could never create a stable medium-term funding source
for commercial bank lending, even if we thought that was our job. Which it is not. This point is not
widely appreciated, but is very germane to current policy debates. The rest of this talk may make that
easier to understand and I shall come back to it at various points.
5

What I want to do next is to explore the overall scale of central bank actions during the crisis. I

am then going to take you through the crisis in chronological fashion, describing the new operations
that we introduced, in sequence, and their implications for the balance sheet. I shall finish with some
remarks on how we might exit from those operations as the economy recovers. (Clearly, a very
2

detailed chronology would take some time. The first appendix sets out a timeline/aide-memoire of our
operations during the past two years or so.)
6

Like central banks in other advanced economies, our operations have evolved very rapidly over

the past two years. That has resulted in a considerable expansion of the balance sheet, especially since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Relative to annual nominal GDP, the balance sheets of the US
Federal Reserve (Fed), the Eurosystem (ie the ECB and the national central banks of those states that
have adopted the euro) and the Bank of England have all increased by broadly similar amounts, as
shown on Chart 1.2

If one included the Bank’s Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS) – which, as an asset swap, is off

balance sheet – the UK expansion would reach around 25% of annual GDP. Before moving on to the
details, it is worth setting recent events in a much longer historical context. The Bank’s balance sheet
as a proportion of GDP has – even excluding the SLS – been expanded to be about as large as at any
point in the past two centuries, a period that included: the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars; two
world wars; the Great Depression, and a number of banking failures and financial crises (Chart 2).

The Eurosystem’s balance sheet is larger in normal times, partly reflecting a much bigger demand, proportionate to GDP,
for banknotes in the euro area.

The Bank’s balance sheet prior to the crisis
8

In normal circumstances, we would implement the desired monetary policy stance by setting

interest rates. Our ability to do that derives from the banking system’s demand for central bank
money: banknotes in circulation and the balances held by commercial banks in their reserves accounts
at the Bank of England. We would set the price of this money and then supply the quantity demanded
consistent with that price. The size and composition of the central bank balance sheet plays no
independent role.

The Bank’s Main Liabilities
9

Banknotes are one of the two main liabilities of the Bank. They are bought from us at face

value, on demand (shown in blue on Chart 3).3
10

The other main liability on the Bank’s balance sheet is the aggregate balance on commercial

bank reserve accounts (shown in green on Chart 3). These essentially act like current accounts for
commercial banks. Such balances are among the safest assets a bank can hold and they are the
ultimate means of payment. They can be used by banks to make payments between each other, or to
purchase banknotes or other assets from us.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

The profits from issuing c£50 billion of banknotes in the UK – known as seigniorage income – are all passed to Her
Majesty’s Treasury. To that end the Bank’s balance sheet is internally partitioned into two components: Issue Department
and Banking Department, with banknotes being the sole liability of the former. In this speech I refer only to the
consolidated balance sheet.

Reserves balances are intrinsic to the Bank’s normal implementation of monetary policy. To

understand how the Bank’s balance sheet has changed during the crisis, it is important to understand
how the Bank undertakes this function in normal circumstances. Let me briefly outline the key
features of the revised framework introduced in May 2006.
The Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework from May 2006

12

The framework had three main elements: reserve accounts, standing facilities and open market

operations. They came together to keep overnight and other very short term interest rates broadly in
line with Bank Rate between the MPC’s decisions. Over the monthly maintenance period, that is
between MPC meetings, commercial bank reserves holdings are remunerated at Bank Rate, so long as,
over the month, they average within a narrow range around a target. A unique feature of the UK
system is that commercial banks choose their own reserves target at the start of each monthly period.
Individually, on any given day, commercial banks have a choice between varying their reserves
position at the Bank and transacting in the market.
13

In case of operational disruption, or exceptional volatility in overnight interest rates, reserves

account holders may also borrow from, or lend to the Bank via our Operational Standing Facilities.
They can do this overnight in unlimited amounts, but at a penal rate compared with Bank Rate.
Providing banks are able to meet their individual reserves targets, this framework provides incentives
for participants to arbitrage and so minimise any difference between market rates and Bank Rate until
5

the next MPC decision date. But for this to work, the Bank needs to ensure that its (net) supply of
money to the system is just sufficient in aggregate so that the commercial firms’ targets for reserve
accounts are validated. The new SMF initially generated reserves balances of around £24 billion in
May 2006. These liabilities are shown in green on Chart 3.
Open Market Operations (OMOs)
14

The Bank’s Open Market Operations (or OMOs) are the means through which we provide

sufficient money to the system so that banks can collectively meet their targets for reserves accounts.
These operations are ordinarily the balancing item on the balance sheet and their size reflects all the
day-to-day sterling flows across the Bank’s balance sheet. Under the 2006 framework, OMOs were to
be undertaken on a weekly basis via an operation in which banks bid, usually to borrow funds from the
Bank, at Bank Rate.
15

OMOs take the form of lending money against high-quality collateral (that is a ‘repo’

transaction) for a fixed term. These loans could, in principle, be exclusively done via short-term
operations. Our standard one week operations are assets, shown in yellow on Chart 4.
16

However, effective implementation of monetary policy does not require the Bank to roll over

its entire stock of loans each week. Such ‘churn’ would be inefficient. Much of the bank note issue is
expected to be permanent, or at least long lasting. In order to avoid too high a churn in its assets, part
of the notes issue can be backed by instruments with a longer maturity. From January 2006, the Bank
started to offer longer-term repo operations at market interest rates for three, six, nine and twelve
month maturities. These assets are shown in light blue on Chart 44. And, in January 2008, the Bank
began to conduct purchases of UK government bonds, shown in darker blue on Chart 45, as a device
to match the duration of the note issue with even longer duration assets. This was of course separate
from, and much smaller than, the subsequent gilt purchase programme by the MPC begun in March
2009. More on that later.

Other items
17

I don’t have time in this speech to discuss all of the items on the Bank’s balance sheet. For

those interested in more detail there is an annex which covers items such as the Bank of England’s
foreign currency reserves, and its customer business.

The Bank’s balance sheet since the start of the current crisis
18

To recap, the objectives of the Bank’s operating framework are a function of the two core

purposes of the Bank in the spheres of monetary and financial stability. They are to implement
monetary policy by maintaining market interest rates in line with Bank Rate at maturities to the next
MPC decision date. And to reduce the cost of disruptions to the liquidity and payments services
supplied by commercial banks, via the ability to provide short-term liquidity support. This ‘liquidity
insurance’ must be balanced against the costs of creating incentives for banks to take greater risks.
19

It will be helpful to make a distinction between these two objectives as I describe the Bank’s

response to the crisis. For monetary policy implementation, the main changes started in March 2009
when, with interest rates close to zero, large elements of the framework were suspended to allow the
direct injection of money into the economy, on a much larger scale, and independent of the demand for
banknotes or reserve account balances. For our liquidity insurance operations, the evolution was more
continuous, although it is fair to say that the pace of change accelerated when the failure of Lehman
Brothers led to a widespread loss of confidence in the financial system in September 2008.

The early stages: liquidity insurance actions
20

There was some expansion of the Bank’s balance sheet from August 2007 onwards, principally

because, in response to the stresses in bank funding markets, banks voluntarily chose to hold more
reserves. That was how our system was designed to work. Our counterparty banks collectively
increased their reserves targets from £16 billion in July 2007 to a peak of £45 billion by December
2008. At the start of the maintenance period in September 2007, however, the commercial banks
collectively raised their targets by only £1.1 billion. It was clear to us that this was insufficient and
that more liquidity would be needed. Using the flexibility built into the system, the Bank expanded its
lending operations beyond the amount needed for banks to meet their targets. At one point during that
September 2007 maintenance period around an additional £9 billion was injected. In order not to
penalise the commercial banks for holding reserve balances in excess of their targets, during
September, the Bank also widened the normally narrow target ranges for each bank within which
reserves were remunerated, to ensure that the banking system as a whole could hold the additional
reserves without financial penalty. The target ranges were widened again in Autumn 2008 when the
crisis deepened.

operations article in the 2008 Q1 Quarterly Bulletin.

Extended collateral three-month repo OMOs
21

During the Autumn of 2007, it was clear that the lack of liquidity in markets was preventing

banks from funding themselves through normal means. Initially, we provided additional 3 month
operations, offering 4 auctions of £10 billion each, against wider collateral and at a penalty rate. These
were not taken up by the banks. By December 2007, bank funding markets had become even more
difficult. So, there was a co-ordinated approach by the major central banks who all announced
additional measures. In the UK, we offered further expanded 3 month repos. This time without a
penalty, against a much wider range of collateral than accepted previously. This included AAA
RMBS and covered bonds.
22

These extended collateral long-term repos (or eLTRs) were offered in auctions initially of £10

billion. When the crisis deepened in the Autumn of 2008, they were offered in greater size and at
greater frequency and the eligible collateral was widened further to include securities backed by
commercial mortgage assets and corporate debt. At their peak during January 2009 the stock of
outstanding ELTRs reached £180 billion (the light blue bars on Chart 4 show this).
Special Liquidity Scheme
23

Following the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, financial conditions began to deteriorate

again, particularly in bank funding markets. The Bank designed and introduced the Special Liquidity
Scheme (SLS) which was launched on 21 April to improve the liquidity position of the UK banking
system by allowing banks and building societies to swap high-quality, but temporarily illiquid,
mortgage-backed and other securities for UK Treasury bills. The key principles of the SLS were (i)
that it would be done in large scale - it eventually reached £185 billion (ii) it would offer liquidity for a
medium-term period - of up to 3 years and (iii) to avoid inappropriate incentives in future (ie the
‘moral hazard’ issue), only assets already on commercial banks’ balance sheets at the end of 2007
were eligible. And all the main UK banks agreed to take part.
24

SLS swaps are structured similarly to stock lending transactions, with banks paying a fee for

the bills they borrow. Hence they do not appear on the Bank’s balance sheet. The terms of the SLS
made it equivalent to three-year funding. How does this sit with the central bank not providing
funding? The key point is that the SLS could not be funded by creating central bank money. It was
only possible using funding provided from the Government via UK Treasury bills. This reinforces the
point that bank funding can only be provided – directly or indirectly – by savings.

8

25

After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, financial market conditions

deteriorated dramatically further. The Bank introduced a number of additional measures. The
drawdown period for the SLS was extended from 21 October to the end of January 2009.
Discount Window Facility
26

The Discount Window Facility was launched in October 2008. The Bank drew on a number of

the features of the SLS in designing this new, permanent bilateral liquidity insurance facility. In the
Facility, banks and building societies may borrow gilts against a wide range of collateral, at fees
reflecting the type of collateral and the size of drawing. It is designed to avoid encouraging imprudent
liquidity management in the future. Like the SLS, transactions under the DWF represent asset swaps.
They do not appear on the Bank’s balance sheet, and they do not normally affect the provision of
central bank reserves.
27

In recognition of continuing stresses in financial markets, the Bank announced in January 2009

that, for an additional fee of 25 basis points, it would permit drawing from the DWF with a term of 364
days in addition to the standard option to draw for 30 days.
28

For us, the DWF was perhaps the most significant development in our operational framework

in this period. In launching it, the Bank took the decision that it could be transparent about the
collateral it is prepared to take in a new, permanent public facility. The terms were designed to be
consistent with avoiding creating incentives for commercial banks to take greater risks in future. Of
course, they were also designed to protect the Bank from the risk of loss.
29

For assets to be admitted as eligible in the DWF, the Bank needs to be able to value them, and

to be able to manage the risks in the event that counterparty default means that we take outright
ownership. The fees that apply in the DWF reflect the type of collateral used, with higher fees being
applied the more risky the collateral, with ‘own-name collateral’ – where the assets were originated by
the borrowing bank – being in the category with the highest fee. We are considering widening the
collateral eligible for use in the DWF in due course, subject of course to the basic principle that we
must be able to value and manage the associated risks.

US dollar repo operations
30

There was one further major response to the pressures created by Lehman Brothers collapse.

As some dollar funding markets closed, there was extremely poor liquidity in dollar inter-bank
9

markets, especially during European trading hours before the US market opened. This problem had
existed for continental European banks from quite early in the crisis and the ECB had conducted a
currency swap with the Fed to provide dollar loans in the European time zone. But the problems
became more acute and widespread from September 2008. So the Bank of England joined other
central banks in offering to lend US dollars overnight, beginning on 18 September 2008. The Bank
established a swap facility with the Federal Reserve to provide the funding for these operations,
offering $40 billion initially. By late September, the immediate pressure had eased somewhat, but
concerns remained about access to US dollar funding, especially over the quarter end. The Bank
introduced a one-week operation alongside its overnight operations. In mid-October, the central banks
involved in US dollar operations announced that the existing variable rate auctions were to be replaced
with fixed-rate operations of unlimited size.6 The Bank began conducting additional operations at
one-month and three-month maturities, with counterparties able to borrow any amount against the
Bank’s wider pool of eligible collateral. At its peak, the stock of US dollars provided through the
Bank’s operations reached about $86 billion. (These assets are shown in pink on Chart 4 and the
proceeds of the swap with the Fed as a liability on Chart 3)).
31

As pressures receded during 2009, the central banks involved announced the withdrawal of,

first the overnight and then the one month dollar operations and, in September, of the three month
operations. In common with the New York Fed and other central banks, the Bank continues to keep its
US dollar operations under review in the light of market conditions.
The later stages of the crisis: implementation of monetary policy
32

In the stressed market conditions that prevailed from August 2007 until March of this year, the

flexibility inherent in the existing framework was sufficient to implement monetary policy, with one
exception – draining excess liquidity.

Draining: Bank of England One-Week Bills
33

I have noted how extra liquidity was injected via eLTRs in large scale in the Autumn of 2008.

That meant that there was more central bank money in the system than was needed to meet the demand
for banknotes and reserve accounts. Short-term lending operations (an asset shown in yellow on
Chart 4) were not necessary and were halted. On the required scale, widening the target ranges for

This was facilitated by a change to US law permitting the Fed to pay interest on reserves balances.

10

accounts would no longer have been sufficient and the excess central bank money would have been
inconsistent with the desired setting of interest rates. So our liquidity insurance operations were
creating a challenge for monetary policy control. We needed a new instrument to drain money from
the system. That new instrument was the one-week Bank of England bill. These were offered to
commercial banks via weekly tender, and remunerated at Bank Rate. At their peak, over £100 billion
of bills were issued on 8 January 2009 (a liability shown in purple on Chart 3). They also
subsequently became an integral part of the regime under the early months of the asset purchase
programme, when they were changed to be variable rate.
34

Aside from introducing these bills, the Bank’s apparatus for implementing monetary policy

was largely unchanged. And the size and composition of the Bank’s balance sheet played a role in
liquidity insurance, but no independent role in the delivery of the MPC’s desired monetary stance.
The Asset Purchase Facility.
35

That changed on 5 March 2009 – my first week as Director for Financial Markets and my first

MPC meeting as a voting member of the Committee – when we announced that, in addition to
reducing Bank Rate by 50 basis points to its lowest ever rate of 1/2%, the Bank would undertake a
programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. As we purchased
assets from the financial sector, we allowed sufficient money to remain in the system so that reserves
would rise in line with our asset purchase programme. In fact, we were forcing the banks collectively
to hold far more reserves than they would have chosen as voluntary targets. Because of that,
significant elements of the SMF were suspended. Instead of having voluntary targets and reserves
averaging, we made a controlled expansion of reserve balances, and remunerated all reserve accounts
at Bank Rate. And we used Bank of England bills to drain any excess created by the simultaneous
injection of money by the eLTRs. This programme initially involved a plan to buy £75 billion of
private and public sector assets, over a period of three months and was increased at subsequent MPC
meetings to currently stand at £200 billion.
36

The purpose of these asset purchases (which have been mainly gilts) is to expand money

spending in the economy and hence help the MPC meet the inflation target. The way in which it does
that has been described elsewhere, but in essence, boosting the cash holdings of those who sell the
assets will trigger a range of further adjustments in the economy. That should have the effect of
raising asset prices, reducing yields on more risky assets, and will subsequently feed through to money
spending.

11

37

In addition to the monetary aspects of the purchase programme, the Government had, in

January 2009, authorised the Bank to commence the purchase of corporate assets to improve liquidity
in selected corporate funding markets. The aim of these facilities is not to ‘fund’ the corporate sector.
Rather, by making small targeted purchases, initially of investment grade commercial paper and
subsequently corporate bonds, the Bank aims to reduce the cost of corporate finance by reducing
liquidity premia. These purchases currently form part of the MPC’s quantitative easing programme.
However, initially, corporate asset purchases were funded by a cash deposit which was in turn funded
by the Debt Management Office issuing Treasury Bills. Should corporate purchases continue when
the MPC’s asset purchase programme ends, then that financing mechanism would be employed again.
38

All the assets purchased in these programmes, gilts and corporate securities, are held off

balance sheet in the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund (the BEAPFF). This Fund is
financed by a loan from the Bank – an asset shown in green on Chart 4. As with the SLS, the Fund is
indemnified for losses by the Government.
The transition of the balance sheet to a post-crisis world : the road to recovery
39

As we have noted, the expansion of the Bank’s balance sheet, to a size that as a proportion of

GDP is as large as at any time in the past two centuries, initially reflected an increase in our liquidity
insurance operations, and subsequently the decision by the MPC to make asset purchases.
40

Eventually, these operations will need to be unwound.

41

When the time comes for the MPC to tighten monetary policy, it will be able to do so either by

raising Bank Rate, or by selling assets back to the market, or by some combination of the two. As and
when assets are sold, reserves balances will fall accordingly, and that will tend to cause the balance
sheet to contract. Independent of the operation of monetary policy, the Bank will continue the
schemes to undertake operations in corporate debt, for as long as they are judged to be necessary.
42

The overall size of the balance sheet may well not fall back all the way to pre-crisis levels. Not

least because banks may choose to hold higher reserves balances than before the crisis. One
motivation for this might be to help meet the more demanding liquidity requirements recently
proposed by the FSA. The Bank has also recently expanded the range of firms that are eligible to hold
reserves accounts, to include smaller banks in order to help them to manage their liquidity. Previously
only those with ‘Eligible Liabilities’ of £500 million and who therefore paid Cash Ratio Deposits to
the Bank were eligible for reserves accounts. Now, all firms that report under the CRD regime,
regardless of their size, will be able to apply to hold a reserves account at the Bank. This potentially
12

adds around 200 firms. The balance sheet impact of this for the Bank may be small, because even
taken together these new balances will be relatively little. This is an important extension to the range
of firms that is able to access the Bank’s market-wide facilities.
43

Of the liquidity insurance operations I have described, the transition back to a more normal

situation is in some cases time-limited, and in others it is state-contingent. In the case of the SLS for
example, the facility was introduced as a temporary measure and the last swaps will expire by end
January 2012, at which point the SLS will be closed.
44

The US dollar operations of the Bank and other major central banks were similarly intended to

be a temporary measure in the context of exceptionally stressed market conditions. They are currently
hardly being used but are due to run to 1 February.
45

On the other hand, extended collateral long-term repo operations and the Discount Window

Facility are intended to be permanent features of the liquidity insurance menu of the SMF. As Chart 4
shows, it is quite striking that, as the MPC expanded its purchases of assets, the participation in eLTRs
has dropped. As we have forced the banks to hold ever more reserves and as market conditions have
improved, their demand for liquidity through the eLTRs has reduced.
46

In the eLTRs, the Bank sets a minimum yield for bids involving wider collateral. This is set at

a level such that in non-stressed conditions it is more attractive to finance the collateral in the private
repo markets. So, as stress in markets abates, there are price incentives built into the design that
should result in a decline in participation in our operations.
47

Similar principles apply to the DWF pricing. Unlike the extended collateral repos, the DWF is

available on demand. The amount borrowed is determined by the counterparty, but at prices and on
conditions determined in advance by the Bank. The prices are a function of the collateral type offered
by the counterparty, and the amount of the counterparty’s borrowing; and they increase as banks’
borrowing increases, and/or is made against riskier collateral. Even at low levels of borrowing,
however, the pricing structure is designed to be more expensive than is available in private markets in
non-stressed circumstances. In this way, the pricing schedule for the Bank’s provision of liquidity
insurance is carefully balanced against the cost of the existence of insurance creating incentives for
banks to take excessive liquidity risk.

13

Concluding remarks
48

This talk has been quite detailed. But I hope that it has helped explain a number of points

about the Bank’s balance sheet and its operations since the crisis began. Here are a few conclusions
you may like to take away:
• The extent of the Bank’s support for the economy has been truly, historically, massive - both in
terms of liquidity insurance operations and monetary policy. That shows up in the expanded size of
our balance sheet.
• There has been an unprecedented pace of change and innovation in our facilities. Nevertheless, the
schemes have been carefully designed to protect against losses impacting on the Bank.
• We can provide temporary short-term liquidity support to individual banks and to the system as a
whole.
• And we can set expansive monetary conditions even when interest rates reach close to zero.
• But we can’t provide medium-term funding for banks to carry out lending. That must ultimately
come from private sector savings or, possibly, from Government. Similar principles apply to
purchases of non-financial corporate assets in any significant scale.
• At some point, the large expansion in our balance sheet will have served its purpose, and we shall
return to more normal times. The temporary facilities are either time limited or have price
disincentives to use in normal conditions.
• The Bank’s balance sheet will return to something like its former composition, and perhaps even its
former size. Our work is not over yet, but the innovations introduced during the crisis should leave us
much better prepared to deal with stresses in the future.

Annex 3: ‘Other Items’ on the Bank of England Balance Sheet
Ways and Means
1
‘Ways and Means’ is the name given to the Government’s overdraft facility at the Bank. Prior
to the transfer of the government’s day-to-day sterling cash management from the Bank to the Debt
Management Office (DMO) in March 2000, the outstanding daily balance varied significantly
reflecting net cash flows into and out of government accounts. Since March 2000, borrowing from the
Bank has not been used to facilitate day-to-day cash management and the balance was generally stable
at around £13.4 billion until the facility was repaid during 2008. The Bank and the Treasury agreed to
this repayment in order to provide the Bank with additional balance sheet flexibility in responding to
the demands of the financial crisis. The facility however remains available for use.
Foreign exchange reserves
2
The Bank of England holds its own foreign exchange reserves. These reserves are separate
from the Government's foreign exchange reserves, which the Bank manages as HM Treasury's agent.
The institutional arrangements for exchange rate policy and foreign exchange reserves was set out as
part of the new monetary policy framework introduced by the government in 1997.7 Under this
framework, the Government is responsible for determining the UK’s foreign exchange rate regime.
The Government’s foreign exchange reserves are held in an account called the Exchange Equalisation
Account (the EEA), and the current size of the government’s gross reserves is approximately $66
billion. The EEA is managed by the Bank as agent for the Treasury.
3
But the framework also provides for the Bank of England to have its own separate pool of
foreign exchange reserves which the MPC may use at its discretion to intervene in the support of its
monetary policy objective – in other words, the Bank may intervene in foreign exchange markets as
part of its operating framework for meeting the inflation target which the government sets for the
MPC. The size of the Bank’s reserves is modest compared with those of the Government, and stands
at approximately $6 billion. The Bank finances the acquisition of its reserves by issuing foreign
currency securities in its own name in the international capital markets. The currency denomination,
maturity and size of this issue reflects the Bank’s judgment on where the best value for money may be
achieved. In recent years, issuance has taken the form of an annual syndication of a $2 billion 3-year
bond.
4
Intervention in foreign exchange markets by the UK is now very rare. That reflects the
Government’s monetary policy framework which sets the inflation target as the nominal anchor for the
economy, and which allows the exchange rate to be market-determined. Prior to that, when the
monetary policy framework included an exchange rate objective (either formally as in sterling’s
membership of the ERM, or informally as part of exchange rate shadowing) intervention by the
Government was more common in support of that exchange rate objective. Another context in which

20

the Government may use its foreign exchange reserves is that of participating in concerted
international interventions, such as the G7 US dollar interventions in the 1980s.
5
The Bank has not intervened in foreign exchange markets on its own account since the inception
of the 1997 monetary policy framework. And over the same period, the Government has intervened
using the EEA only once, in September 2000 as part of concerted international intervention to support
the euro.
Other assets and liabilities
6
Some of the Bank’s capital and reserves are held in equity holdings, eg in the BIS and ECB and
of course the Bank’s physical assets. The remainder (the Bank’s ‘free’ capital), together with the
proceeds of non-interest-bearing Cash Ratio Deposits placed with the Bank by UK-resident
commercial banks are invested in a portfolio of sterling-denominated securities.
7
The Bank also provides banking services for a small number of customers, mainly other central
banks. These accounts appear as liabilities of the Bank and are placed back out in deposits.
