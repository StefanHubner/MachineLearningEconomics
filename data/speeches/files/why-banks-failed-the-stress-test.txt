WHY BANKS FAILED THE STRESS TEST

By any historical standard, the financial crisis of the past 18 months has been
extraordinary. Some have suggested it is the worst since the early 1970s; others, the
worst since the Great Depression; others still, the worst in human history. Time will
tell.

Risk managers are of course known for their pessimistic streak. Back in August 2007,
the Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs, David Viniar, commented to the
Financial Times:

“We are seeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row”

To provide some context, assuming a normal distribution, a 7.26-sigma daily loss
would be expected to occur once every 13.7 billion or so years. That is roughly the
estimated age of the universe.
A 25-sigma event would be expected to occur once every 6 x 10124 lives of the
universe. That is quite a lot of human histories. When I tried to calculate the
probability of a 25-sigma event occurring on several successive days, the lights
visibly dimmed over London and, in a scene reminiscent of that Little Britain sketch,
the computer said “No”. Suffice to say, time is very unlikely to tell whether Mr
Viniar’s empirical observation proves correct.

Fortunately, there is a simpler explanation – the model was wrong. Of course, all
models are wrong. The only model that is not wrong is reality and reality is not, by
definition, a model. But risk management models have during this crisis proved
themselves wrong in a more fundamental sense. They failed Keynes’ test – that it is
better to be roughly right than precisely wrong. With hindsight, these models were
both very precise and very wrong.

For that reason, 2008 might well be remembered as the year stress-testing failed.
Failed those institutions who invested in it in the hope it would transform their

2

management of risk. Failed the authorities who had relied – perhaps over-relied – on
the signal it provided about financial firms’ risk management capabilities. And,
perhaps most important of all, failed the financial system as a whole by contributing,
first, to the decade of credit boom and, latterly, the credit bust.

That is a stark conclusion. But it is a conclusion which is hard to escape. When
tested against real stress, large parts of the financial system seized-up and a number of
financial institutions failed. Against that backdrop, now is as good a time as any for
candour about what went wrong. That is the purpose of my comments today: to
diagnose some of market failures or frictions in stress-testing practices highlighted by
the crisis; and, more speculatively, to suggest some practical ways in which stresstesting might deliver answers which are “roughly right”.

The Golden Decade

To understand the recent failures in risk management, some history is instructive.
Prior to the current financial crisis, the previous two low tide marks for the financial
system and risk management were the stock market crash of October 1987 and the
failure of the hedge fund LTCM in September 1998. Both prompted a sea-change in
risk management practices and technologies.

The October 1987 crash in many respects marked the birth of Value at Risk (VaR) as
a key risk management tool in financial firms. By 1989, Dennis Weatherstone, JP
Morgan’s then-chairman, called for a “4:15 Report”, which combined all of the firm’s
data on market risk in one place. That report should contain information sufficient to
answer the question “How much could JPM lose if tomorrow turns out to be a
relatively bad day?”

With this as the top-down edict, it is perhaps unsurprising that JP Morgan were an
early-developer and early-adopter of VaR. By 1996, they had published their
methodology and the detail of the parameterisation of their risk models. In 1998
RiskMetrics Group, an independent for-profit business, spun off the JP Morgan
methodology and began offering consultancy services to the risk management
community. And from 1997 onwards, VaR came to take a degree of prominence
3

within the regulatory community, with first the US SEC and subsequently the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) giving further impetus to VaR, including
through the design and implementation of Basel II.

By 2006, when Philippe Jorion published his famous textbook on VaR, relatively few
would have disputed the claim in its title - “Value at Risk: The New Benchmark for
Managing Financial Risk”. The message was clear: the technological frontier of risk
management had been shifted outwards decisively. A cursory search suggests that
there have been more than 200 books published on VaR since the October 1987 crash,
or roughly one a month.

The date of birth of stress-testing is harder to trace. Early mention is made of it in a
technical note by RiskMetrics in 1996. But it is clear that stress-testing was given
considerable impetus by the failure of LTCM more than a decade after the October
1987 crash. Unlike VaR, which had private sector origins, the official sector appears
to have been at least as much a driver behind the adoption of stress-testing. By 2001,
under the auspices of its Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP), the IMF
was publishing details of its stress-testing methodology and experience. Today, the
same cursory search reveals over 250 articles on stress-testing in the past ten years, or
more than one a fortnight. We were experiencing a second wave of technological
revolution in risk management.

This technological transformation contributed to what was, with hindsight, an
extraordinary period of growth and success for the financial system and financial
markets – a Golden Decade. Between October 1998 and June 2007, banks’ share
prices increased almost 60% and their balance sheets rose more than threefold. In
some markets growth was little short of explosive, with the rise in volumes
outstanding in the CDS market making Moore’s Law look positively sluggish.

And why was this credit boom not destined to end in bust? Because this time was
different. At the same time as returns were being boosted by bigger balance sheets
and financed by higher leverage, risk was being held in check by a shift in the
technological frontier of risk management. A new era had dawned, one with
simultaneously higher return and lower risk. This miracle came care of a compelling
4

combination of cavalier risk-takers and roundhead risk-managers. Or so ran the
rhetoric.

With hindsight, this Golden Decade and its aftermath has all the hallmarks of, in
Charles Kindleberger’s words, Manias, Panics and Crashes. Enthusiasm about return
gave way to hubris and a collective blind eye was turned to the resulting risk. This
was a latter-day version of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale, “The Emperor’s
New Clothes”. In a classic collective delusion, the Emperor’s new clothes, you will
recall, were admired by all. Conferences like this one became catwalks for banks and
the authorities alike, parading their new garments through the streets in all their
finery. Risk modelling became high fashion for the pointy-heads, haute-couture for
the anoraks.

The past two years have rather changed all that. The sub-prime market has played the
role of the child in the fairytale, naively but honestly shifting everyone’s perceptions
about how threadbare the financial system had become. The madness of crowds, as
Charles Mackay so vividly put it, became visible to all. The resulting unravelling of
the Golden Decade has been little short of remarkable.

Asset prices have collapsed – for example, world equity prices have lost more than
three-quarters of their gains during the Golden Decade. Prices of banks’ shares have
fared even worse, losing almost 60% of their value and are now lower than at the start
of the Golden Decade. In the face of these falls, risk management systems across
virtually all institutions have been found badly wanting. A survey of 500 risk
managers by KPMG in October last year found that 92% intended to review their risk
management practices.

Estimated losses within the financial sector since the start of the crisis lie anywhere
between a large number and an unthinkably large one. Today, managers of risk – the
authorities just as much as banks – find themselves struggling to preserve their
dignity, with risk management systems a combination of sack-cloth and fig-leaf. This
year, stress-testing conferences like this one are more doghouse than catwalk.

Diagnosing the Market Failures

So what were the failures, specifically of stress-testing and other risk management
tools, that contributed to this credit boom and subsequent bust? It is useful to try and
identify the micro-economic friction – the market failure – that was the root cause of
these risk management problems. Doing so better enables both financial institutions
and the authorities to pinpoint what needs to change and how. These market failures
fall roughly into three categories:
•

disaster myopia;

•

network externalities; and

•

misaligned incentives.

All three have impeccable microeconomic credentials and potentially disastrous
macroeconomic consequences.

Disaster Myopia

In a nutshell, disaster myopia refers to agents’ propensity to underestimate the
probability of adverse outcomes, in particular small probability events from the
distant past. That makes it sound like a rather unworthy informational failure. In fact,
it is well-established in cognitive psychology that economic agents have a tendency to
base decision rules around rough heuristics or rules of thumb.1 The longer the period
since an event occurred, the lower the subjective probability attached to it by agents
(the so-called “availability heuristic”). And below a certain bound, this subjective
probability will effectively be set at zero (the “threshold heuristic”).

If the period of stability is sufficiently long – a Golden Decade perhaps? - this
subjective approach to evaluating probabilities looks increasingly like a fully-rational,
Bayesian approach to updating probabilities. As time passes, convincing the crowds
that you are not naked becomes progressively easier. It is perhaps no coincidence that
the last three truly systemic crises – October 1987, August 1998, and the credit crunch
1

For example, Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky (1982).

6

which commenced in 2007 – were roughly separated by a decade. Perhaps ten years
is the threshold heuristic for risk managers.

Models of disaster myopia have been used to explain a number of phenomena,
including the tendency for drivers to slow down having witnessed an accident and
then speed up once the accident has become more distant in their memory, and for
people to under-insure against low frequency natural hazards such as earthquakes and
floods. In the context of financial crises, disaster myopia has been used to explain the
LDC debt crisis, the US savings and loans debacle and various commercial property
crises.2 The credit crunch of the past 18 months is but the latest in a long line of
myopia-induced disasters.

Such disaster myopia is not of course confined to the private sector. The official
sector is just as likely to succumb to cognitive biases borne of long periods of
stability. With hindsight, the stress-tests required by the authorities over the past few
years were too heavily influenced by behaviour during the Golden Decade. Many risk
management models developed within the private sector during the Golden Decade
were, in effect, pre-programmed to induce disaster myopia. These models were often
data hungry. Improvements in data and IT technology were able to feed these beasts
with vast, high-frequency datasets. This provided, in the statistical jargon, ample
degrees of freedom for modellers, enabling them to devise risk frameworks which, on
the face of it, were very precisely calibrated in-sample.

And there’s the rub. The sample in question was, with hindsight, most unusual from a
macroeconomic perspective. The distribution of outcomes for both macroeconomic
and financial variables during the Golden Decade differed very materially from
historical distributions. Charts 1-8 illustrate this small sample problem. They look at
the distribution of a set of macroeconomic and financial variables, comparing the
Golden Decade with a sample stretching back in some cases to the 17th century. Even
visually, these distributions plainly suggest that the Golden Era distributions have a
much smaller variance and slimmer tails. More formally, Table 1 looks at the first
four moments of these variables, comparing the Golden Era with the full sample.

2

For example, Guttentag and Herring (1986a) and Herring (1999).

7

For the macro time-series, the differences in variability are striking. The long-run
standard deviation of UK GDP growth has on average been 4 times greater than
during the Golden Decade; for unemployment 5 times greater; for inflation 7 times
greater; and for earnings 12 times greater. Put differently, as part of the Basel II
regime the FSA require banks to simulate the effects of a 1-in-25 year stress. In 2007,
the worst such GDP growth outcome over the preceding 25 year period was -1.4%;
the average 1-in-25 year stress over the full sample is -3.8%.

For financial time-series, small sample problems are even more acute, especially for
events in the tail of the distribution. Measures of kurtosis – the fatness of the tails –
of UK house price inflation are 6 times larger over the full sample than over the
Golden Decade; for UK bond yields 10 times larger; and for UK equity returns 16
times larger. To bring these stylised facts to life, consider the distribution of equity
returns in Chart 7. If we assumed the Golden Era distribution was the true one, the
three worst monthly returns in history – the bursting of the South Sea bubble in
September and October 1720, and Black Monday in October 1987 – would have been
respectively 12.7, 6.9 and 6.5-sigma events. All three would have appeared to be
once in a lifetime – of the universe – events.

Underestimation of risk, whether variances or tail outcomes, has consequences for the
risks facing both individual firms and for the system as a whole. As an example of
the former, Chart 9 plots some unconditional 90th percentile VaRs for a selection of
UK banks, based on their equity returns up until end-July 2007 and then extended to
include the present crisis.3 These unconditional VaRs for UK banks increase, on
average, by almost 60% once the sample is extended; and for some banks these risk
measures more than double.

For the system as a whole, one way of illustrating the consequences of
underestimating risk is to translate it into “fair value” insurance premia. For example,
consider a financial firm offering insurance against moves in future equity prices by
writing put options in mid-2007. Pricing of this insurance is assumed to be based on

8

the distribution of equity returns during the Golden Decade. If the “true” distribution
of returns were its long-run average, by how much would this insurance have been
under-priced in 2007?

Chart 10 provides some answers for a selection of strike prices for the option. The
degree of under-pricing of risk is large and is larger for options designed to protect
against tail risks (lower strike prices). For at-the-money options on UK equities, the
insurance premium would have been under-priced by around 45%; for options well
out-of-the-money – say, 50% below equity prices at the time – the mis-pricing would
have been nearer 90%. This is risk under-pricing on a dramatic scale.

These examples are no more than illustrative. But they help illustrate that the
quantitative consequences of disaster myopia were material ahead of crisis and may
have contributed importantly to the price of risk being set too low. And that, in turn,
helped sow the seeds of the credit boom.

Network Externalities

Any asset portfolio is, in essence, a financial network. So the balance sheet of a large
financial institution is a network, with nodes defined by the assets and links defined
by the correlations among those assets. The financial system is similarly a network,
with nodes defined by the financial institutions and links defined by the financial
interconnections between these institutions.

Evaluating risk within these networks is a complex science; indeed, it is the science
of complexity.4 When assessing nodal risk, it is not enough to know your
counterparty; you need to know your counterparty’s counterparty too. In other
words, there are network externalities.5 In financial networks, these externalities are
often referred to as contagion or spillovers. There have been many examples of such
spillover during this crisis, with Lehman Brothers’ failure a particularly painful one.

That is why there have been recent calls to calibrate regulatory requirements to these
risk externalities.6

These network uncertainties make it tremendously difficult for risk managers to
identify and price, and hence manage, balance sheet risk. Consider first evaluating
risks across the portfolio of an individual firm. There is evidence that firms find
aggregation of risks across their balance sheet extremely difficult to execute.7 To the
extent this is done at all, it requires firms to make assumptions about correlations
between asset prices. But at times of stress, asset correlation matrices are unlikely to
be stable and correlations invariably head towards one. So pre-crisis measures of
balance sheet risk are likely to be significant under-estimates. Chart 11 looks at asset
correlations over the past few years. Note their instability and abrupt upward shift
during crisis.

These risk externalities will tend to be amplified when aggregated across the network
as a whole. This generates further underestimation of institutional risks. Consider
again those 90th percentile VaR measures for UK banks. But instead of looking at
unconditional VaR, consider now conditional VaRs (CoVaRs) – that is to say, VaRs
conditional on other institutions in the network simultaneously facing stress.8 As
Chart 12 shows, this raises the median risk facing UK banks by around 40%; and for
some banks, risk estimates almost double. For a financial firm leveraged 20+ times,
those risk revisions could be the difference between success and failure.

Network risk externalities of this type impose formidable informational demands on
banks. For example, understanding the full consequences of Lehman’s failure would
have required information on the entire topology of the financial network. This is
unrealistic even for the authorities, much less an individual firm. Absent that
knowledge, the financial system was seized by network uncertainty. If this
informational failure is not easily rectified by the actions of individual firms, there is a

case for the authorities attempting to provide that missing informational public good,
however difficult that might be in practice.

Misaligned Incentives

Finally, and perhaps most contentiously, incentives and governance. Principal-agent
problems crop up in all aspects of economics. But it is questionable whether there is
any event in recent history where these agency problems have been exposed so
frequently and extensively as during the current financial crisis. It is easy to see why.
Financial innovation lengthened the informational chain from ultimate borrower to
end-investor. The resulting game of Chinese whispers meant that, by the time
information had reached investors at the end of the chain, it was seriously impaired.

In the narrower context of stress-testing, these principal-agent problems appear to
have operated at two distinct levels. First, internally, through the relationship
between risk managers and the risk-takers within financial firms; and second,
externally, in the relationship between financial firms and the authorities. The former
principal-agent problem has been rather less discussed, but appears to have been
potent during the credit boom.

Decision-making within firms is an arm-wrestle between risk and return, between risk
managers and risk-takers. When returns are high and risks appear low, this armwrestle can become one-sided. Power switches from back to front offices and risk
managers become the poor relation.9 And what is true within individual firms is then
amplified by behaviour across the system as a whole, as firms conduct their own armwrestle with competitors for higher returns on equity. The Bank’s market intelligence
suggested this “keeping up with the Jones’s” was a potent force within financial firms
during the upswing.

The second principal-agent problem, between firms and the authorities, is different in
kind but similar in consequence. It arises because of a familiar public policy problem
– time-consistency. If the ex-post failure of an institution risks destabilising the
9

The KPMG survey of risk managers in October 2008 pointed to a similar conclusion, as does the
FSA consultation paper on stress-testing published in December 2008.

11

system, any ex-ante pre-commitment by the authorities to let it fail will lack
credibility. This is simply a variant of the old adage that if you owe the bank a small
amount it is your problem, a large amount it is theirs. These days, if a bank owes a
small amount it is their problem, a large amount it is the authorities.

This time-consistency problem weakens incentives for banks to consider for
themselves large-scale risks to their balance sheet which might induce failure. The
safety net becomes a comfort blanket, the backstop a balm. And the greater the risk
these institutions themselves pose in the event of failure, the weaker the incentives to
manage risk. These are topsy-turvy incentives from a public policy perspective, with
risk management discipline weakest among those whom society would wish it to be
strongest.

And the evidence? A few years ago, ahead of the present crisis, the Bank of England
and the FSA commenced a series of seminars with financial firms, exploring their
stress-testing practices. The first meeting of that group sticks in my mind. We had
asked firms to tell us the sorts of stress which they routinely used for their stress-tests.
A quick survey suggested these were very modest stresses. We asked why. Perhaps
disaster myopia – disappointing, but perhaps unsurprising? Or network externalities –
we understood how difficult these were to capture?

No. There was a much simpler explanation according to one of those present. There
was absolutely no incentive for individuals or teams to run severe stress tests and
show these to management. First, because if there were such a severe shock, they
would very likely lose their bonus and possibly their jobs. Second, because in that
event the authorities would have to step-in anyway to save a bank and others suffering
a similar plight.

All of the other assembled bankers began subjecting their shoes to intense scrutiny.
The unspoken words had been spoken. The officials in the room were aghast. Did
banks not understand that the official sector would not underwrite banks mismanaging their risks?

Yet history now tells us that the unnamed banker was spot-on. His was a brilliant
12

articulation of the internal and external incentive problem within banks. When the big
one came, his bonus went and the government duly rode to the rescue. The timeconsistency problem, and its associated negative consequences for risk management,
was real ahead of crisis. Events since will have done nothing to lessen this problem,
as successively larger waves of institutions have been supported by the authorities.

More recently, the Bank and FSA have been engaged in some practical work with
banks, running stress-tests through their models on common scenarios. When asked
to assess the consequences of a macro stress-test, the like of which we are currently
experiencing, some banks have found it problematic. In defence, they have suggested
that such an exercise was only conducted annually as part of their Basel II
preparations and as such new stress tests would take months to conduct.

This too was revealing. If even the most obvious stress-test took many weeks to
prepare and assess, how could these tests meaningfully be used to manage risk? The
short answer, I think, is that stress-testing was not being meaningfully used to manage
risk. Rather, it was being used to manage regulation. Stress-testing was not so much
regulatory arbitrage as regulatory camouflage.

Prescribing Some Solutions

Each of these market failures has been exposed by events over the past 18 months.
When risks materialised outside of calibrated distributions, risk models provided little
guidance in identifying, pricing and hence managing them. This failure is not of
purely academic interest. The breakdown of risk models is itself likely to have
contributed importantly to crisis dynamics. Why?

First, the potential losses arising from under-pricing of risk are large. Consider the
earlier example of a disaster-myopic writer of deep out-of-the-money put options on
UK equities, priced using distributions drawn from the Golden Decade. Let’s say
that, in June 2007, a five-year put had been written on the FTSE-100 with a strike
price 40% below the prevailing market price. Today, that put would be at-the-money.

13

Hedging that position would crystallise a loss roughly 60 times the income received
from having written the option in the first place.10

This example is far from hypothetical. These are essentially the same trades
undertaken by a number of insurance companies and other investors ahead of crisis.
In the go-go years, the insurance premia from them yielded a steady income stream.
But when risk shifted, many insurers have suffered large-scale losses as premia have
adjusted and investors have scrambled to hedge. The large US insurer AIG has so far
suffered gross losses totalling over $60bn on CDS contracts alone. Losses by the
monoline insurers have also totalled in excess of $60bn.

Second, the breakdown of these models had the consequence of turning risk into
uncertainty, in the Knightian sense.11 Once the models broke down, how were assets
to be priced? Practitioners have a devil of a job pricing assets in the face of such
uncertainty. So too do academics, though some attempts have been made.12 The
theory of asset pricing under Knightian uncertainty throws up at least two striking
results. First, in the face of such uncertainty, asset prices are not precisely determined
but instead lie in a range. This indeterminacy in prices is larger the greater is
uncertainty and the greater agents’ aversion to it. Second, asset prices exhibit a
downward bias relative to fundamentals. Uncertainty gives the appearance of
“pessimistic” expectations.

Both of these theoretical predictions match pretty closely the moments of many asset
prices in the world today. Many appear to lack a clear compass relative to
fundamentals. Most are excessively volatile. Among investors, pessimism is the new
optimism, with talk of a lost decade in succession to the Golden one. Risk models –
or the failure thereof – have played their part in generating these foggy outcomes.

That is the diagnosis. What of the prescription? In their recent consultation paper,
the Financial Services Authority has outlined some very good proposals for

improving stress-testing practices among financial institutions.13 Based on my
reading of the identified failures in stress-testing, let me put forward a complementary
“five-point plan”.
•

First, setting the stress scenario. The key elements here are devising a
multi-factor risk scenario that is sufficiently extreme to constitute a tail event.
Arguably, designing such a scenario is better delegated to the authorities than
to individual firms, in part because they ought to be more immune to disaster
myopia. In its Financial Stability Report (FSR), the Bank describes such
stress scenarios. In future, the Bank aims to be able to offer through the FSR
some greater clarity to financial firms about the sorts of vulnerability scenario
it thinks they could use as one (and only one) input to their stress-testing
machinery. This might include both solvency and liquidity-type scenarios. As
the FSA have proposed, banks should also test to destruction their balance
sheets through “reverse” stress tests, in order to identify potential areas of
balance sheet weakness.

•

Second, regular evaluation of common stress scenarios. Having banks
conduct regular evaluations of their positions relative to a set of common
scenarios (provided by the authorities) would be an improvement on current
practices in several respects. First, it would allow some degree of
benchmarking of results across institutions; second, it would allow a degree
of benchmarking, and hence peer review, of models; and third, it would
hopefully help in ensuring stress-testing exercises form an input to
management decisions and are not an annual regulatory ritual. Comparing
these bottom-up exercises with top-down evaluations conducted by the
authorities – the like of which have appeared in recent Bank FSRs - can also
help in benchmarking results and models.

•

Third, an assessment of the second-round effects of stress. The results of
these common stress evaluations should be the starting point, not the end
point. These common stress tests need to be made dynamic, so that the second

15

and subsequent round interactions, and their consequences for system-wide
risk, can be evaluated. This calls for an iterative approach to stress-testing in
which banks’ first-round results and management actions influence secondround stresses facing firms – for example, the effects of asset sales and
liquidity hoarding. In effect, what we would then have is a hybrid stress testcum-war game. This will better enable firms to assess the spillover and
contagion consequences of their own and others’ actions, so helping
internalise to some degree the network externality problems which have been
prevalent through this crisis. This dynamic, collective approach to stresstesting has already been attempted in one or two countries; it would be
desirable if it became standard practice more widely. The recent Geneva
report on financial regulation proposes greater use of such systemic stress
testing. From the authorities’ side, the Bank is developing a framework which
will enable us to capture such network effects – for example, the effects of
liquidity contagion and asset price disposals – on other firms in the network.
The results from that framework could be used alongside firm-specific results
to gauge network risks.14
•

Fourth, translation of results into firms’ liquidity and capital planning.
The results from these exercises need to influence management outcomes if
they are to be useful; the internal incentive problem needs to be overcome.
So there should be a presumption that the results of these dynamic stress tests
are taken, for example, to banks’ risk committees. And banks’ executives
should periodically be asked how they intend to respond to these findings,
including how effective their defensive responses are likely to be when the
stress is system-wide and how the results affect liquidity and capital planning
decisions.

•

Fifth, transparency to regulators and financial markets. The bank-specific
results ought to inform regulatory decisions about firms’ capital and liquidity
buffers. Indeed, there is a case for having these results set out regularly in
firms’ public reports. This would hopefully help exert a degree of market

14

Aikman, Alessandri, Eklund, Gai, Kapadia, Martin, Mora, Sterne and Willison (2008).

16

discipline over management choices, as has been proposed by the Treasury
Committee.15 Existing disclosures by banks are a patchwork of different
practices which make cross-firm comparisons of risk nigh on impossible.
Having a standardised, published set of such stress-testing results would help
improve financial markets’ understanding and hence pricing of bank-specific
risk – a particular problem during this crisis – thereby helping address the
external incentive problem.

Working alongside the other Tripartite authorities, the Bank would be interested in
exploring with financial firms the feasibility and desirability of putting this five-point
plan into practice. This plan is about making stress-testing more robust but also more
relevant. It is about providing that missing informational public good. In the armwrestle with management, it is about supplying power to the elbow of risk-managers.

Conclusion

Let me conclude. As after the previous two episodes of systemic failure, in October
1987 and August 1998, a third wave of technological transformation in the standards
of risk management is now needed as a matter of priority. Firms themselves admit as
much. That calls for a new agenda. I have outlined some elements of such an agenda,
to address some of the failures exposed by the crisis. These measures involve a
greater degree of engagement both between risk managers and senior management
within firms, and between financial firms and the authorities. They would also
involve much greater transparency to the wider world about risk metrics and
accompanying management actions. These measures would not prevent a next time –
nor should they – but they might help make risk management roughly right.
