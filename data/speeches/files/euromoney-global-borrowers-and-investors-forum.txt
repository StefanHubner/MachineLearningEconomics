EUROMONEY GLOBAL BORROWERS AND INVESTORS FORUM, 23 JUNE
2005: REMARKS TO THE SESSION “WHERE ARE THE RISKS?”1

Central bankers are fond of discussing myriad uncertainties in the global macroeconomic and
financial environment. Yet judging by the level of implied volatility, derived from option
prices, on a wide range of asset classes, the market perceives uncertainty as fairly low. And,
even after the recent adjustment, credit spreads across a wide range of instruments suggest
that the premium charged for risk has fallen over recent years. This, all in an environment
where long-maturity risk-free forward rates – real and nominal – are unusually low. It is hard
to know quite what to make of this, but it forms an important backdrop to the few remarks I
want to make today.
For this audience, I think the interesting question is not whether or not risk will crystallise, as
in one form or another risks crystallise every day. Rather, the important question is whether,
in the event of nasty shocks, our capital markets can absorb them or whether they have
developed characteristics which may, as some suggest, leave them vulnerable. Or, more
constructively, what risk managers – and the authorities – might usefully monitor to help
contain any such risks.
It’s hardly a new question. But it’s one that has gained colour from the debate about
derivatives. An oddly polarised debate. Overstating it somewhat: in one corner, a group
contending that derivatives bring tangible benefits to civilisation. In the other, a group
arguing that they have within them the seeds of severe disorder.
Unsurprisingly, my take is that the truth lies somewhere in between. It is nicely illustrated by
the quite extraordinary development of the credit derivatives market over the past five years
or so.2

Dispersion of risk, and the price of risk
Credit derivatives plainly have been used as an effective risk management tool by a number
of banks and others. Contrary to some suggestions, the acid test is not especially whether
banks, individually or in aggregate, have been net sellers of credit risk. Individual banks
have been able to reduce concentrated loan exposures to single corporates, industries or
countries. As the Telecom episode reminded everyone just a few years ago, that is really
important, if elementary. Individual banks have also been able to increase their exposure to
borrowers with which they do not have a lending relationship. (Indeed, some commentators
suggest that it may sometimes be more effective for second-tier and smaller banks to take
corporate credit exposure via the derivatives market than via participation in the lower tiers
of loan syndicates.) If, overall, the result were a greater dispersion of risk around the banking
system and fewer large exposures relative to capital, the system as a whole would probably
be safer even if, net, no credit risk had left the banking industry in aggregate.
According to various surveys, some credit risk has been shed to non-banks, including
insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds. That too should, on balance, promote
the resilience of the system, not least because non-banks are not part of the core payment
systems that underpin our financial markets – provided, of course, that banks prudently
manage their counterparty exposures to non-bank sellers of credit protection. As others have
argued, this is a change of degree rather than kind: with the growth of corporate bond
markets, and especially securitisation, non-banks have been running credit portfolios for
years. By separating the provision of liquidity from exposure to credit risk, credit
derivatives, and the related developments in structured finance, give non-banks new ways of
accessing credit risk.
As well as more dispersed risk buttressing systemic stability, the innovation of credit
derivatives has plausibly taken us a further step towards complete markets, in effect
providing a richer market for credit insurance than previously existed. Investors and others
may, therefore, be able to get a little closer to the portfolios they really want to hold, which
would facilitate a better allocation of risk and so bring broader welfare benefits. This works
in the direction of reducing the price of risk, which would reduce the risk premium used to
discount uncertain future cash flows.

4
There are, therefore, tangible benefits from the new derivative markets for unbundling and
transferring credit risk. And the same can be argued for the earlier development of interestrate, foreign currency and equity derivatives.
So where’s the catch?
Short-option positions and market dynamics
Everyone is familiar with the risk present in markets if ‘everyone’ tries to sell – or buy – at
once. Various features of markets can create the conditions for, or reinforce, such herd-like
behaviour. Panic in the presence of excess leverage is the familiar culprit, and goes back to
well before the invention of derivatives, as various authors have documented in the context of
the Great Crash. Derivatives have not altered the firmament in some deep, unrecognisable
way. But they have introduced some novel variations on old themes.
One of the most interesting can potentially arise when a particular market is characterised by
traders who are structurally short options, have short holding periods, and are leveraged; and
where the underlying markets are not highly liquid. That needs a bit of unpacking.
Options can, of course, be hedged with an offsetting position in a similar option: a so-called
‘static hedge’. Where, for one reason or another, traders cannot do that, they can attempt to
hedge by running a position in the underlying instrument, with the intent that gains or losses
on the value of their option positions will be offset by losses or gains on the underlying asset
position: a so-called ‘dynamic’ hedge. It’s dynamic hedging that can be interesting.
The effects of dynamic hedging of long and short option positions can be quite different.
Broadly, dynamically hedging a long option position entails selling the underlying as prices
rise, and buying as prices fall. Conversely, those who have sold (or written) options need to
buy to balance their hedge when the value of the underlying is rising, adding to the buying
pressure. And, if the price of the underlying instrument is falling, they need to sell to balance
their hedge, adding to the selling pressure.
This is, of course, going on every day in a wide variety of deep and liquid markets without
anything particularly odd happening to market dynamics. Things are potentially more

5
interesting when markets are structurally imbalanced, with short-term traders, dynamically
hedging, concentrated on one side. If short-term traders are structurally long, their dynamic
hedging may have the effect of dampening market movements, producing zones of local
stability. But where, as a group, they are structurally short, their dynamic hedging can
sometimes amplify price movements, increasing volatility, if the market proves illiquid under
stress.
While I have set this out in a rather general way, it isn’t fanciful. There are examples of it
going back over nearly twenty years: some involving the explicit writing of options; some
implicit writing of options; and some arising from trading strategies that mimic optionality.
For example, the 1987 equity market crash was exacerbated by the prevalence of portfolio
insurance, a trading strategy akin to delta hedging an option: sell when prices are falling. A
dynamic variant of a ‘stop loss’.
Similar strategies are now a key feature of some Principal-Protected hedge fund investments,
via so-called Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI). To preserve the nominal
principal, the ‘guarantor’ will sell units in, say, a fund of funds as its value falls, and vice
versa. I guess some assumptions are made about underlying liquidity, and that these are
reflected in how such strategies are effected.
In 1994, and again in 2003, hedging the negative convexity of US mortgage-backed
securities amplified the rise in dollar bond yields, with some violence.3 The underlying
factors here, of course, are that US mortgage borrowers have an option to prepay, so they are
long options on mortgage interest rates. The financial sector is, correspondingly, structurally
short options, which it can – and does – slice and dice in various ways in an attempt to
distribute the option exposure to those who want it. But to a greater or lesser extent, a
residue is left, some of it with institutions which de facto seem to have short holding periods.
They dynamically hedge, either continuously or within thresholds.
A rather graphic – if, ultimately, not stability-threatening – example of what I’m describing
occurred a few weeks ago in the structured credit markets. I’ll spend a few moments on this

2003, page 22.

as the distribution of optionality was quite complex. For some while, a wide range of
regional banks, insurers and pension funds in Europe and Asia have been selling protection
on intermediate tranches of credit portfolios, say on losses between 3% and 7%. Although
they are effectively short an option on portfolio credit risk, they are widely regarded as
passive investors who do not dynamically hedge. Their counterparts, the dealers, are initially
long an option on portfolio credit risk; as spreads generally widen, the value of the boughtprotection position increases non-linearly. Over time it became popular amongst short-term
leveraged traders to exploit the strong supply of intermediate (or mezzanine) protection by
holding a bought-protection position on mezzanine tranches as a hedge against selling
protection on equity tranches. This was a so-called long credit correlation position, as its
value would tend to increase with rises in the implied correlation of default risk among the
companies represented in the underlying portfolios. In effect, traders were betting that
implied correlation, as modelled, would not fall. As well as being highly convex, the
position’s popularity no doubt owed something to a straightforward search for yield: the big
positive carry from being long high-yielding equity tranches and short lower-yielding
mezzanine. This type of position did, though, leave holders exposed to so-called
idiosyncratic risk; that’s to say, a deterioration in the credit of a few constituents of the
underlying portfolio. This was akin to a short-option position, requiring dynamic hedgers to
buy protection as spreads widened on troubled names. When GM and Ford spreads rose,
these correlation positions unravelled as traders went into the market to cover themselves. In
effect, the structured credit market was reminded that credit risk has a major idiosyncratic
element; that even the most sophisticated statistical models can be found wanting when they
are detached from fundamentals and/or based on short runs of data; that hedging can hurt
when a trade is ‘crowded’; and that, in such circumstances, volatility can suddenly spike and
spreads move in unplanned-for ways.
There are still-more complex variants. In some instances, options are embedded into
products where there isn’t a liquid market in options with quite the same characteristics or
long expiry dates. Power-Reserve Dual Currency Bonds may be an example,4 although not
one where excess volatility has yet crystallised.

While these and other examples suggest that, in certain conditions, volatility can be
exacerbated by option-driven or option-like trading strategies, related developments in global
capital markets can at times help to dampen volatility. Notably, with the growth of the hedge
fund industry, there are more short-term traders willing to take risk – in effect providing
liquidity – when they perceive a temporary anomaly, as perhaps happened in the US bond
market during summer 2003. That is somewhat less likely, though, when the prior trading
strategies of funds themselves have become part of the underlying imbalance.
This points up a useful lesson. That the major intermediaries – and the authorities – would
do well to try to identify where there might be big structural short, or imbalanced, option
positions in a market whose liquidity might be strained in stressed conditions. Sometimes, as
for example in the US mortgage market, this amounts to identifying a structurally long
position and asking whether the counterpart short positions are well distributed and how
managed. Sometimes, as perhaps in the structured credit market, it may amount to asking
whether there is anything that could trigger an exit by apparently long-term and passive
holders of short option positions. For the firms themselves, this kind of analysis may be
something that could be fed into stress tests developed in recent years to examine the effects
of the exit of a dealer or major fund. Central banks rely largely on market intelligence. At
the Bank of England, one of the questions we now more or less routinely ask in our MI work
goes along the lines of “is the Street and/or is the fund community short volatility
/gamma/vega in a big way in any particular market?” This is discussed further in the latest
edition of the Bank of England’s Financial Stability Review, which is published next
Monday. Regulators can put any general information gleaned from MI alongside their more
granular sources on the positions of firms.
A risk properly understood is, I hope, a risk that can be managed effectively. And so my
analysis of the impact of options hedging on market dynamics does not cancel out the
benefits that derivatives can potentially bring. For the reasons described earlier, the plugging
of ‘missing markets’ is something to welcome.
Innovation, competition, and risk management
That so many markets are no longer ‘missing’ owes something to innovation in the wholesale
financial services industry. The underlying forces driving innovation seem to be powerful,

8
and indeed perhaps self-feeding. They may also give rise to some risk management
challenges.
One possible story – there are others – would go along the following lines.
Core wholesale markets have become more efficient. This has been driven by a whole host
of things, including improved technology and deregulation reducing transaction costs; the
unbundling of different types of risk associated with the development of derivatives; and the
entry of relatively unconstrained traders, including hedge funds. One result is that in
‘vanilla’ markets it may have become more difficult for intermediaries to make positive
risk-adjusted returns that exceed their cost of capital. Anecdotally at least, they make a more
attractive return on, amongst other things, exotic products and via transactions tailored to
address the risk-management challenges of particular clients or client types. As such, they
have a powerful incentive to innovate.
Over time, many of the most successful innovations become mainstream, enhancing market
efficiency, helping to optimise the distribution of risk, and reducing the initial supernormal
returns to the innovators, who move on to the next thing; and so on. As put, that sounds like
a benign story for society. And, by and large, I think it is. It does, though, have at least two
corollaries.
First, investors – whether in funds or firms – should occasionally ask themselves whether
they can safely extrapolate into the future the returns that they have earned in the past.
Second, investment bank innovators may from time to time face a challenge in keeping the
industry’s controls up to speed with what, ex post, turn out to be their most successful
innovations. Imagine that, at any particular time, a firm has a portfolio of many innovations.
Some will succeed, some won’t. Ex ante, they won’t know for sure which is which.
Plausibly, it might not be economical to put controls in place for every single innovation on
an assumption of ‘exponential growth’. So when exponential growth occurs, controls can
sometimes be left behind.
Maybe something like that helps to explain the backlog in credit derivative confirmations,
which the FSA cautioned banks about a few months ago. Growth in the market has been

9
relentless. And to the concerns about confirmations have been added concerns, amongst
practitioners, about unnotified assignments of credit derivative positions, related in part to the
growth of hedge fund participation in the structured credit market. If something really bad
were to happen, the system would, perhaps, be less robust than otherwise if dealers were not
sure about who their counterparties were, etc.
This is the type of challenge where collaboration across the industry is needed; and where
individual firms’ incentives are stronger if they can each be confident that their peers are
taking broadly the same actions. What I have in mind is the disincentive a firm faces in
being tough with a hedge fund client if they doubt their peers will take the same line. Bodies
such as ISDA have a role to play here, and I understand are doing so.
Collective elements in atomistic markets
So, where are the risks? They are all around us all of the time, of course. Some will
crystallise. But that need not lead to disorder. Indeed, in most circumstances, global capital
markets are deep and liquid enough – having a sufficiently wide range of participants able to
trade with each other, and with different risk appetites and different actual risk exposures – to
absorb shocks. But history suggests that strains can appear at times. And as the system
develops, we need to be alive to whether cracks might show up in new places or old
weaknesses manifest themselves in new ways.
The two challenges I have sketched out for today’s markets – the incidence, now and then, of
structural short option positions amongst short-term traders; and of controls occasionally
lagging behind innovations – have a common feature. They both entail understanding
markets as something more than the positions of atomistic agents. In the first case, market
participants have an interest in factoring into their risk management an assessment of whether
a market has structurally imbalanced option (or option-like) positions. In the second case,
market participants have an interest in working together to establish robust practices and
infrastructure when a particular innovation takes off.

10
Many risk managers are, of course, well seized of this. Let’s hope they are empowered too.
As practitioners, you can, and should, play a part in buttressing the system – by continuing to
innovate, and by factoring collective outcomes into your private calculus and risk
management.
