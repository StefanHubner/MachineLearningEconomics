It is a great pleasure to be here today. Judging by the capacity crowd, the businesses
you represent are in pretty good spirits.
What better way to start than by thanking you for your excellent hospitality.
And what better place to celebrate an important double anniversary. Because that’s
what today is, for me.
It is exactly a year since I joined the Bank of England as Deputy Governor for
Monetary Policy. And it is forty years, almost to the day, since I started my first job.
I was a waitress: in a famous seaside town – the one that’s noted for fresh air and fun.
It wasn’t much of a job. But then I wasn’t much of an employee, having no
marketable skills, but plenty of attitude. I learnt how to carry several plates at the
same time and a lot of interesting new words; and the job paid for a memorable
holiday in Greece. Looking back on it, I’m sorry I left without giving notice: though
I’m not sure my boss was.
My work habits have improved immeasurably since those far off days. And so I think
has British hospitality.
The ‘eating out experience’ has certainly been transformed. At the very top end of the
market, there are now over a hundred Michelin starred restaurants compared with less
than thirty in my youth. The past decade has seen a huge investment in both hotels
and visitor attractions. Three of the top five fee paying visitor attractions in the UK
are less than five years old, with the wonderful London Eye now comfortably
outstripping that doughty old trouper, the Tower of London. London doesn’t have it
all its own way of course – the ground breaking Eden Project now comes in at a well
deserved number three.
Tourism has become more than good business. From the Welsh Valleys to the East
end of London, it is increasingly seen as a catalyst for economic regeneration. With
the success of the Manchester Commonwealth games, and Liverpool’s ambitious
plans for 2008 as European City of Culture, not to mention London’s Olympic bid,
there’s no shortage of high profile events and projects to provide inspiration for the
future.

Your industry is still a major employer, of course. You must provide more jobs than
the NHS and the Armed Forces put together. I’d be the last person to underrate the
importance of entry level and seasonal jobs; but you need highly skilled people too.
So it’s good news that thousands of people are already on tourism and hospitality
related FE and work based courses. Your new Sector Skills Council will provide an
even sharper focus on defining and meeting your industry’s training needs.
Nowadays, your industry makes a major contribution to our national income, and to
our exports. And it’s not surprising that your fortunes are heavily influenced by the
economic climate at home and abroad.
The decade of strong growth which you have enjoyed has been underpinned, at the
national level, by an unprecedented period of low and stable inflation, and steadily
growing output and employment. Unemployment has been falling for over a decade
and has now reached a thirty year low. And household spending has been growing
strongly year in year out since the mid 1990s.
What this means is that for many years your customers have been enjoying a very
healthy growth in their spending power, in a labour market where jobs have by and
large been plentiful.
Of course, averages never tell the whole story. And hindsight is a wonderful thing.
At the time, it didn’t always seem like plain sailing.
The Stock Market crash, the slump in transatlantic traffic after September 11 and, last
year, Iraq war related fears have represented setbacks, especially for London based
businesses. Over the past few years, overseas tourism has been affected by the
economic slowdown in North America and much of Europe and, maybe also, by the
strength of the exchange rate. On the other hand, though foot and mouth hit the
industry very hard in some parts of the country in 2001, domestic tourism seems to
have held up well.
And that’s probably because the UK economy has weathered the squalls of the past
few years rather better than both the US and the euro area. Since 2000, we have
grown more strongly than the euro area, and more steadily than the US; indeed we are
alone among major industrial countries in not having experienced a single quarter of
falling output for more than a decade.

As a result the UK emerged from the slowdown in the world economy with less slack
than other economies. That is the key reason why we were the first to start raising
interest rates last November, when world activity started to pick up and demand at
home accelerated. Since then, a number of other countries, including the US, have
begun to raise their rates to more normal levels.
When I joined the Monetary Policy Committee a year ago, both the Fed and the ECB
had just cut their interest rates to exceptionally low levels, reflecting real concerns
about the strength of the world recovery. Activity picked up sharply in the US last
autumn, but the mood only changed decisively early this year, when a million new
jobs were created in just three months. It is now clear that a broad based world
recovery is well under way, led by the US and Asia, especially China, but spreading
to other regions.
The news from Japan is more encouraging than it has been for over a decade. The
UK’s major markets in Europe are benefiting from strong demand for their exports;
and the latest news suggests that domestic demand in most of these countries is finally
picking up, though consumers probably still remain a little wary.
As the news from abroad has steadily improved, we have also seen a marked
strengthening in demand at home. After a fairly weak first half, retail sales bounced
back, the housing market took on a new lease of life and investment began to recover.
It now looks as if the UK economy has been growing around or above trend since the
middle of last year.
It was against that background that the Monetary Policy Committee raised interest
rates in three further stages to 4.5%. Meanwhile inflation remains low, well below
the Chancellor’s target of 2%.
This might seem to bear out the old taunt, that central bankers are the sort of people
who want to close the bar as soon as the party starts to go with a swing. It would be
fairer to say that we want to be sure that the party remains under control. We don’t
want to encourage binge behaviour any more than you do, and for much the same
reason; it makes life unpleasant for other people, and it leaves a nasty mess behind.
That points to taking action at the first sign of trouble, and preferably before. In
current circumstances, strengthening demand is beginning to put upward pressure on
costs. Evidence from our Agents round the country, as well as official statistics,

4

suggests that the labour market is tightening, and firms are having difficulty in filling
some vacancies, despite the inflow of workers from the rest of the EU.
These are straws in the wind, but if we delay taking action until inflation has taken
off, it will be more difficult to bring it down again without causing the economy to
slow sharply. That’s why our interest rate decisions need to reflect a view of likely
inflationary pressures that looks a couple of years ahead.
Our central forecast is that the economy will continue to grow strongly over the next
year before easing back towards its longer term average, as both household and public
spending slow down a bit. But any central forecast is subject to a wide margin of
uncertainty, and there are a number of key risks.
The housing market is one. Obviously, there are many aspects of housing which have
nothing to do with monetary policy. It is striking that fewer houses were built in 2001
than in any year since the Second World War; and over 12% fewer houses were built
in the ten years to 2002 than in the previous decade.
It is not the MPC’s job to control house prices, any more than it is our job to control
share prices or the exchange rate; but just as we would not ignore the wider economic
effects of a high exchange rate or a boom in the stock market, so we cannot, and do
not, ignore the influence of soaring house prices on consumer spending and hence on
the overall pressure of demand.
Much attention has been paid to the historically high level of house prices relative to
earnings, and what this might mean for the future path of house prices. A less
discussed question – of more interest to you – is how much influence the current
strength of the housing market is having on household spending; and what impact a
weakening in the housing market might have on consumers.
Healthy as household spending has been in the last few years, there has not a
consumer boom on anything like the scale of the late 80s, when house prices last took
off. Since early 1998, house prices have risen sharply relative to incomes; but
household spending has only grown broadly in line with incomes. A buoyant housing
market may still have had some influence on spending; and spending and house prices
may have been influenced by some of the same factors. But spending and house
prices do not seem to have moved together as closely as they have done in the past.

5

Does that imply that consumers would shrug off a downturn in the housing market?
Not necessarily. The rise in house prices has meant that households have taken on a
lot of debt, and higher interest rates will mean they have less money to spend on other
things. While there are few signs of obvious financial stress at current interest rates,
given the strength of the current jobs market and the current housing market, this
could change, especially if several of these factors weakened at the same time and the
economic climate deteriorated sharply.
That’s a long way from our central forecast, but uncertainty about how consumers
might react to higher interest rates has been an important reason for tightening policy
gradually since last November.
We have also avoided springing surprises. I think that’s important: people are more
likely to believe what we say, if our behaviour is reasonably predictable. But we
wouldn’t be doing our job if we didn’t constantly revise our views in the light of new
information and new research. That is why every month has to be a fresh decision.
And why I can honestly say that I don’t know, any more than anyone else, where rates
will be in a year’s time.
Compared with a year ago, interest rates have risen from 3.5% to 4.5%. But the
international outlook is clearly stronger now, the domestic economy is buoyant, and
inflation remains low. That’s how we like it: and the lesson you should draw from
our readiness to tighten policy over the past seven months is that we are on the case.
I hope that will give you the confidence to focus on your main business; creating
wealth and ‘making people happy’.
