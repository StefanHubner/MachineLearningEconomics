The “FinTech” Problem

“The most important financial innovation that I
have seen the past 20 years is the automatic
teller machine.”
 Paul Volcker, December 2009

New Financial Technologies
•

Finance is a market in information – information technology
should matter!

•

Distributed/peer-to-peer model
– world wide web, second-hand goods, publishing, music, taxis,
accommodation etc
– massive productivity improvements in cutting out the middle person
– reduced trading times, cutting costs, widening access

•

Big data in this distributed network
– pricing/marketing using granular data

The “Sharing Economy” - AirBnB

– Averages 425,000 guests per night, totaling more than 155 million
guest stays annually — nearly 22% more than Hilton Worldwide.
– Valuation exceeds well-established global hotel chains like Hyatt.
- 76% of Airbnb properties are actually outside the main hotel
districts, suggesting complementarity of their offering.
- Although also likely to have an impact on hotel industry. Recent
study suggested an 8-10% impact on other hotels’ revenues in
Texas.

(2013), “Trust in the sharing economy”; PWC (2015), “The sharing economy”.

The “Sharing Economy” - Uber
– Over one million rides on a daily basis. Market valuation now higher
than Ford and General Motors
– Cheaper than conventional taxi’s in most US cities, even excluding
tips
– Surge pricing algorithm to equilibrate supply and demand
– Several taxi firms copied their business model – “Uberification”
– Key feature in both is the ability to harness consumer feedback and
build trust in the system.
Sources: Hall et al (2016), “The effects of Uber’s surge pricing”; Finley (2013), “Trust in the sharing economy”; PWC (2015), “The sharing
economy”, Forbes (2015), “At $68 Billion Valuation, Uber Will Be Bigger Than GM, Ford, And Honda”.

Why it Might Matter for Finance

•

Stability of financial system
– New entrants = diverse ecosystem

•

Efficiency of financial system
– Lower margins + higher volumes = higher productivity

•

Democracy of financial system
– Greater access + lower cost = social value

(2015), “UK business finance since the crisis – moving to a new normal?” for further details.

23

Opportunities and Threats
•

Can critical mass be attained? Bad apple risks

•

P2P v “Handelsbanken” model? Hard v soft data

•

How “alternative” is alternative finance?

•

Information barriers to entry - credit registers and Big Data?

•

Regulation of new banks and non-banks
– when is there a systemic threat?

24

Insurance Industry
•

Car insurance

•

Health/Life insurance

25

Driverless Cars
•

In 2020, Google plans to launch a self-driving car which:
–
–
–
–

has already driven nearly one million miles
doesn’t get tired and irritable
doesn’t swerve into lamp posts or require a driving test
has an in-built chauffeur - in the form of a rotating laser taking 1.3
million recordings per second
– can drive better than you!

•

Will anyone own a car in future?
– Reduced car demand through pooling?

•

By eliminating the element of human blunders, driverless cars
are forecast to reduce motor accidents by up to 90%.

Source: Bank Underground (2015), “Driverless Cars: Insurers Cannot be Asleep at the Wheel”.

26

Impact on Car Insurance Market
•

90% fall in premiums?

•

Impact on distribution of premiums - equalise quotes across
ages/genders/risk types?

•

Insurance for car companies rather than drivers?

•

How to deal with cyber-security issues?

•

Important legal implications for liability – who to blame when/if
there is a crash?

27

Health/Life Insurance and Big Data
•

Can Big Data make inroads into adverse selection and moral hazard
problems?

•

Telematics - more information from customers’ wearable devices
– 63% of insurer executives believe wearable technologies will be adopted
broadly by the insurance industry by 2017 [Accenture (2015)]
– But less than 1 in 4 consumers are willing to share their health information
[PWC (2014)]

•

Calibrating existing insurance risk models with richer human behaviour
data
– Tailored premiums by tracking lifestyle habits and social networks?

•

Improved ability to detect fraud by mining unstructured Big Data?
– For example anomaly detection, developing predictive models, network
analysis to facilitate effective investigations.

•

Re-evaluating individual risk vs risk pooling. If you could perfectly
predict health outcomes from DNA data, would everyone self-insure?
