Introduction

I became a member of the Monetary Policy Committee over 6 years ago; I will leave the Committee at the
end of August having by then gone through 75 monthly meetings. When I joined the Committee Bank Rate
had recently been cut to ½% and asset purchases had just begun. At that time it seemed extremely unlikely
that interest rates would remain at this emergency setting for very long and it was not expected that asset
purchases would go very much further (though in retrospect only a piffling £75 billion had then been
purchased).

No one on the Committee in mid-2009 would have thought it even remotely likely that by mid-2015 the
following would be true:


Bank Rate would still be at 0.5%;



Financial market prices would imply that Bank Rate even three years further ahead – mid 2018 –
might only be around 1.6%;



Assets purchased would have added up to £375 billion and none would have been sold;



Inflation would be about 0%.

All this is a sign of the enormous and lasting disruption that came after the financial crisis of late 2008. It is
probably too early to be looking for an epitaph for that financial crisis. But if I had to settle on one today it
might be that of Christopher Wren: si monumentum requiris circumspice – if you are looking for a monument
then just look around you.

And what would you see? In the UK you would see levels of economic activity and of productivity that are
around 15% below what you might have expected if the economy had continued on the trajectory it was on in
the years preceding the crisis; real wages are probably around 20% below that trend. You would also see a
level of inflation that was a long way from the target of 2% – though it seems likely to me that we are heading
back towards the target and that the reasons for the current inflation undershoot are both fairly easy to
understand and their effects relatively benign (things which are most surely not true of the deviations from
trend in wages, productivity and GDP).
This enormous disruption to economic activity – and the uneven, volatile but ultimately downwards path for
inflation which came after it – is why we have needed an extraordinarily expansionary monetary policy. This
expansionary stance was largely put in place in the UK by the end of 2009 and then held for 6 years and

counting . Up to our recent meeting , I have not yet voted for a single change in Bank Rate – a potential
source of some embarrassment as I ponder in years to come the question “what did you do on the MPC?”. A
simple answer might be – vote for hundred billions of asset purchases (so not exactly “er…nothing”). But I
think a better answer might be that I heeded a good piece of advice, which is: don’t just do something, stand
3

there (and think)…
I do have one more meeting on the Committee and it will coincide with the MPC’s August Inflation Report. It
also comes at a time when I think the case for beginning a gradual normalisation in the stance of monetary
policy is stronger than at any time since I joined the committee over 6 years ago.

I will return to this later. But first I want to step back and reflect on what lessons we should take about central
bank policy from the past 6 or so years. I will then come back to the question of what to do next.

Looking back: lessons from the global financial crisis

Dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis has proved exceptionally hard. Self-evidently if we can avoid
the enormous costs of such crises in the future – or at least significantly reduce the probability of facing them
– we should. There are two ways in which that could happen. First, by increasing the scope to use monetary
and fiscal policy to offset the large negative impacts on the economy of a financial crisis. Second, by
reducing the chances of a crisis occurring. Obviously you can proceed on both fronts and there has already
been significant action – the capital of banks has risen and the range of macroprudential and monetary
policy tools available in a crisis (including the availability of central bank liquidity) has been widened
significantly.

I believe that now the benefits of taking further action to reduce the chance of financial crises are likely to be
larger than the benefits of further increasing the range of policy tools to deal with the aftermath of a crisis.
There are several reasons for saying this.

First, there was in fact substantial scope to use monetary policy and fiscal policy after the crisis hit in late
2008. The fiscal deficit did rise enormously and the automatic stabilisers were allowed to work, which is one
reason why the deficit has come down less rapidly than was anticipated. Bank Rate was put to near its floor
by March 2009. But that was not the end of the story. £375 billion of asset purchases followed and the
Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) was launched in 2012. The steady – and ultimately very large – fall in the
cost of credit to the private sector came some time after the cut in Bank Rate and was, I believe, greatly
facilitated by the Bank of England purchases and by the FLS (See charts 1, 2 and 3). I do not think it is so
1

By the end of 2009 Bank Rate had been at 0.5% for three quarters, and a total of £200bn of asset purchases had been announced.

There is some doubt about who exactly said this first. I like the idea that it was the actor and polymath Peter Ustinov, because of what
prompted him to say it. He became fed up in the 1950s and 1960s with being on stage with young actors who were much impressed by
what they saw as the message of the method school that they needed to be hyper active to be great actors.

clear that in the UK the zero lower bound on the interest rate was a major constraint on monetary policy.
Throughout my entire period on the Committee I have never felt that there was no room left to make
monetary policy more expansionary. On those occasions when I felt monetary policy should have been more
expansionary I voted for more asset purchases – often being in the minority. I believe others on the
Committee took the same view that we were not out of ammunition. That is relevant when you consider the
case for raising the inflation target to make more room to cut nominal interest rates in the aftermath of a big
downturn. To my mind putting up with (on average) an inflation rate 2 or 3 percentage points higher so that
on rare occasions you can cut nominal rates further is not very attractive in terms of weighing costs against
4

benefits .

The case for raising the inflation target is stronger if you believe unconventional policy – asset purchases – is ineffective. But I believe
there is evidence against that (for a survey see Joyce, Miles, Scott and Vayanos (2012)). There might be a case for raising the inflation
target if the natural real rate of interest rate has fallen significantly and permanently, but neither is clear at this moment. I will return to
the outlook for the natural interest rate later.

There may yet be some benefits from enhancing the scope for more monetary and fiscal activism to deal
with the aftermath of the next crisis. Such further benefits as may exist are all to do with giving yourself room
to deal with the mess after it has happened. But I believe that reducing the chances of a mess happening in
the first place is likely to yield greater benefits. And the main reason for saying this is that the simplest, and
arguably most effective, policy may well have low long run costs. That policy is to gradually change the
funding structure of banks so that they are much better able to deal with shocks by relying less on debt and
more on equity. That also changes the incentives to take risk in the first place. I want to explain why this is
the better way forward and in particular why it is a better strategy than relying on monetary policy – interest
5

rates – to guard against overheating in the financial sector .

There are two fundamental reasons why having financial intermediaries fund their acquisition of assets with
significant amounts of equity makes sense. First, it directly addresses the problems of improving incentives
and preventing even limited falls in expected asset values triggering big rises in perceived risks of
insolvency. Consider why the very large fall in asset values after the dot.com bubble burst did not have such
6

devastating effects on the US economy. It was because all that frenzied activity was largely financed by
equity and not debt. People who had funded much of the dot.com bubble lost money, but this did not trigger
a whole series of insolvencies in the financial sector and disrupt the flow of credit to the wider economy.

Second, the long run cost of even rather big increases in the amount of equity funding of financial
intermediaries is plausibly quite small. Substantial changes in the use of equity funding have already taken
7

place since the crisis – and on some metrics required capital is as much as ten-times greater than pre 2008 .
And yet there is little evidence that the overall cost of bank funding has increased substantially. The paths of
bank lending rates, both in absolute terms and relative to Bank of England Rates, have tended to fall (charts
2 and 3). And direct measures of the cost of bank funding have been on a steady declining path as capital
ratios have risen (chart 4).

5

What you are about to hear is neither an example of banker bashing nor a bashing of those in charge of regulation before the crisis. I
am in a uniquely bad position to do either sort of bashing having been a non executive director on the board at FSA and an employee of
Morgan Stanley at the time of the crash in Sept 2008. I am not sure this makes me a banker; economists at investment bank had a role
part soothsayer and part court jester so are not really bankers at all.
6
This is the main theme of Titman (2013). Work by Mian and co-authors (2010, 2011, 2013), for the US, and IMF (2012) for a large
panel of countries, show the importance of debt for the real costs of crises.

Chart 4: Indicative measures of UK banks’ long-term funding spreads

Sources: Bank of England, Bloomberg, Markit Group Limited and Bank calculations.

Simple finance theory suggests why, starting from very low levels of equity (high debt leverage), the impact
of large proportionate changes in the use of equity on the overall cost of funds is likely to be small.
Consider the impact of doubling capital – or halving leverage – using the simplest possible back of the
envelope calculation of a bank’s weighted average cost of funds. Suppose we start with leverage of 40 and
cut it to 20 (that is with equity initially of 2.5% of total assets rising to 5%). Let’s imagine that the cost of debt
financing is 5% and the required return on equity (its cost) at the original level of capital is 15%. First, if we
assume that these costs will not change (a pretty big and unrealistic ‘if’ for a dramatic change in leverage),
this will lead to total cost of financing increasing from 5.25% (0.975*5%+0.025*15%) to 5.5%
(0.95*5%+0.05*15%), a rise of only 0.25pp. 25 basis points is what people used to think of as one typical
MPC rate change at its monthly meetings.

And this is an extreme case in which the costs of equity and debt do not change. Theory suggests they
should change so as to reflect the shift in riskiness as equity rises – debt becomes safer and equity returns
less variable. At the extreme (and if the conditions for the famous Modigliani-Miller (MM) theory hold) there
would be no change in the weighted cost of funds. The table below shows the effect of different assumptions
on the degree to which MM effects apply:

There are many reasons why MM does not hold for banks – tax, asymmetric information, segmented
markets (Allen and Carletti (2013)), unique features of bank liabilities in the form of deposits (see DeAngelo
& Stulz (2014)). A combination of the limited liability of shareholders and deposit insurance almost certainly
makes MM not hold for banks. But many of these factors may mean that while MM does not hold, the private
cost of banks using more equity is not a true social cost. (This is certainly true if rises in a bank’s cost of
funding from using more equity arises because of the interaction between limited liability and deposit
8

insurance) .

In some research I did a few years ago (Miles et al 2013) we estimated that the MM offset was about 50%,
which would mean that the rise in the weighted average cost of bank funds from a doubling in the use of
equity is about 13bp. Even with zero MM offset it is only 25bp – a small fraction of the fall over recent
decades in measures of the world real interest rate on relatively safe debt (King and Low (2014)).
Now this is a naïve calculation – it is standard corporate finance 101 – and it does not capture things that are
in some ways unique to banks. And even if the cost to banks of having much greater use of equity may not
be very large, it might still drive activity to institutions that are not technically banks but do bank-like things.
Might it then be that a better way to control risk taking and financial fragility is to use the blunt instrument that
nonetheless gets into every corner of the financial system: changes in the general level of interest rates
driven by monetary policy committees at central banks?

8

We also need to factor in offsetting general equilibrium effects not present in MM that might make the cost of equity lower. One
example is the model of Begenau (2015), where a preference for safe and liquid assets by households breaks MM and implies that
increases in capital requirements can reduce overall bank funding costs and increase bank lending because of the price effects in
equil brium from scarcity of bank debt.

This gets to the heart of the respective roles of macro prudential policy (which in the Bank of England is set
by the Financial Policy Committee, FPC) and monetary policy (where decisions are made by the
Monetary Policy Committee, MPC).

My own view is that skewing monetary policy towards trying to stop financial instability problems is, in
general, unlikely to be the right answer. Yet many seem to think that the crash showed that having narrower
9

aims of monetary policy – centred around an inflation target – was somehow proved wrong. I think that view
fails to look at the deep reasons for the crash, which to my mind were the existence of excess leverage (too
little equity funding) in banks. Excess leverage is not something effectively countered by a general rise in the
level of interest rates. Higher interest rates will tend to increase required returns on both debt and equity and
so it is not at all clear they encourage the use of relatively more equity. Capital requirements – a macro
prudential tool – get to the heart of the problem.

I investigated the relative advantages of using monetary policy and capital requirements to address problems
10

of excess risk taking in some recent work with a colleague at the Bank of England, Chuan Du . Let me
briefly give you the essence of what we found.

Asymmetric information (banks know more about the nature of their assets than those who provide them with
debt) and limited liability give banks the incentive to gear up and take on riskier lending projects. Assets are
riskier than would be the case if those that provide debt funding to banks could see exactly the nature of the
banks’ assets and its risks. The reason is that limited liability puts a floor under returns to providers of equity
but if things go well they get all the upside. That is fine if providers of debt can gauge the risks. But if they
cannot (and surely depositors in banks cannot) this generates inefficient outcomes – risk is higher than it
should be and some loans are made which do not have good risk-return characteristics.

Forcing banks to use more equity through higher capital requirements can mitigate some of these moral
hazard concerns. Banks become more prudent in their lending criteria because there is more to lose when
the project goes sour. But there is a downside. With higher capital requirements, banks will take on fewer
lending projects, and some prospective bankers may even be discouraged from forming a bank in the first
place.

So according to this logic (spelled out more precisely in Du and Miles) bankers are right to say:

1. For them raising equity is costly; and

2. Imposing a higher capital requirement will reduce aggregate lending.

In a speech in 2010, Ben Bernanke argued that the Fed's interest-rate policies in 2003-2005 can't explain the size, timing, or global
nature of the housing bubble. In a recent blog post on 28 April 2015 Bernanke counters John Taylor’s arguments that US monetary
policy was a major source of the housing bubble and other financial excesses by arguing it was not too easy during 2003-2005.

Both statements are correct. But both miss the point. There may be too much lending in the unregulated
state. Equity may look costly to banks but it has an overall beneficial side effect in better aligning the
interests of shareholders with those of other claimants on the bank. To put the point another way: there is an
inherent tendency in banking markets for there to be excessive risk taking. (I sketch in a more formal way the
key mechanism behind this in the Appendix where I also show how monetary policy or capital requirements
can be used to get to the right level of risk taking).

In my work with Chuan Du we focused on two policy instruments that could be used to get the right level of
risk taking in the financial sector:
1. The risk-free rate of interest on funds placed with the central bank – a monetary policy tool;
2. A leverage ratio cap imposed by the regulator on banks – a macro prudential tool.

We found that these two instruments operate as imperfect substitutes in promoting better lending decision by
banks. A tightening of either instrument can improve 'prudence' – by dis-incentivising banks against taking on
too much risk; but only at the cost of decreased 'participation' – whereby more banks will choose to forego
the opportunity to lend.
One can use a mix of the two instruments. But the trade-off between ‘prudence’ and ‘participation’ is
different. Our work suggest that on the whole using capital requirements is more efficient as a way to get the
level of risk taking right in the economy than using monetary policy (interest rates).

This is the road we have gone down in the UK. We have seen big increases in capital requirements. But we
started from extremely low levels of required equity funding for banks, so it is not so clear that even after a
ten-times increase

11

we have reached the right resting place. For what it is worth, I suspect we have not yet

got there (See Miles et al 2013; Du and Miles 2014). The FPC will continue to monitor the appropriate level
of capital for UK banks.

Lessons about Monetary Policy: QE, ZLB and deflation

The global recession led many central banks to lower their policy rates to near zero. With the exception of in
Japan, this was pretty much unchartered territory for monetary policymakers.

As I noted, Bank Rate had just fallen close to its effective lower bound when I joined the MPC, and asset
purchases were just underway. (I will refer to the effective lower bound (ELB) rather than “the zero lower
bound” (ZLB), since the effective lower bound may be slightly above or slightly below zero – though likely

close to it). The predictions from mainstream theoretical macroeconomic models for what would come next
were not comforting. They raised concerns about our capacity to stimulate the economy when policy rates
are at the effective lower bound and the risks of a liquidity trap. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003, EW) had
analysed what happens at such low levels of policy rates and the likely effectiveness of asset purchases.
They suggested that on hitting the lower bound an economy could suffer a deep deflation and recession and
that asset purchases were not likely to help much. Their analysis suggested that the effective way to avoid
deflation in such circumstances would be to commit to future inflation overshooting the target.

I found these predictions somewhat unrealistic, partly because they hinged on the sensitivity of the timing of
spending to shifts in the real interest rate (in economists jargon, that there was a significant inter-temporal
marginal rate of substitution), and that the central bank had no more tools to ease policy other than affecting
expectations about where it would set interest rates once they came off the floor. In many of these models
there was no role for QE to have any effect.

12

But like Bernanke, who even before the recent experience with

QE by many central banks was an advocate of its usefulness, I believe that it was an effective tool,
particularly at a time of severe market disruptions. As Bernanke famously put it “the problem with QE is that it
works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory” (Brookings Institution (2014)).
13

I also doubt that there is a deflation cliff at the ELB . The evidence for thinking that deflation risks become
great at the ELB is actually quite weak. There were no dramatic deflations among OECD economies (except
for Ireland, which saw an exceptionally sharp fall in economic activity), and there was no clear difference in
the change in inflation rates between countries that were constrained by the ELB and those that were not.
Inflation fell in most OECD countries in 2009, but only a few experienced outright deflation.

12

Although EW themselves are upfront about our ignorance on how expectations are formed, and hence on how they could be affected
by QE.
13
More recently, Cochrane (2014) has shown how the EW analysis hinges on arbitrary equil brium selection mechanism. Cochrane
shows that there are (infinitely many) equally valid alternative paths for inflation and output following the onset of a ZLB period using the
same framework as EW. His analysis shows that a ZLB deflation cliff is by no means an unambiguous implication of the stylised
framework of EW, but rather one possible path and that the difference between them is how expectations are formed. It is an empirical
question: what happens to inflation and inflation expectations when the economy hits the ZLB.

Chart 5 shows the change in CPI inflation between 2008 and 2009. Inflation in Iceland fell by more than
8 percentage points, but it had been 17% for 2008. The only large deflation was in Ireland, with -5.8% for
2009; inflation for the euro zone was 0.9%.

Short term expectations of inflation fell only temporarily; there were no big deflation fears. Neither actual nor
expected inflation displayed the deflation cliff at the effective lower bound. Chart 6 shows the difference
between the 1-year ahead inflation expectation of professional forecasters and their average inflation
expectations over the period 2003-2007. Within 18 months of the crash of September 2008 inflation
expectations in most countries have moved back close to their pre-crisis average, and stayed there for the
next few years.

Countries that aggressively eased monetary policy, by cutting interest rates sharply and adopting QE,
showed few signs of de-anchoring in long term inflation expectations.

In the UK and in the US the implied probability of deflation two years ahead (based on option prices) fell
rapidly after monetary policy was eased aggressively in early 2009. Even though UK inflation is now close to
zero the implied market probability that it should be negative two years ahead is under 10%. (Chart 8).

The near term for monetary policy

Even though I think the deflation risks are much exaggerated, we still have to deal with the aftermath of the
financial crisis.

In the UK we have set an uber expansionary monetary policy to offset the hit to demand and the shocks to
the cost (and availability) of borrowing for companies and households. The big policy question is for how long
should we keep policy at this setting. In the UK we are now in a much better place than we have been:
unemployment is down to just under 5.5%; annualised GDP growth has been near 3% for several quarters;
consumer and business confidence has risen sharply over the past year or so; the household saving rate is

14

Caveat: The UK inflation options are based on RPI rather than CPI inflation. We assume market participants think there’s a wedge of
around 1pp between the two measures in the long run, so the UK line shows the weight on RPI being below 1% (i.e. negative CPI). But
that’s likely to be a strong assumption as, if Bank Rate is cut when the risk of deflation is high, one might expect RPI to fall by more than
CPI as a consequence of the mortgage interest payments component of RPI (as we saw in the crisis). This may bias upwards our
measure of the weight placed on deflation in the UK relative to that for the US and euro area.

low and suggests that spending is not being held back by expectations of low near term inflation; wages are
rising; the availability of finance has increased and its cost fallen; corporate profitability looks solid.

It is not all good news. There are clear risks and a sudden return to a more normal level of interest rates is
not very sensible. But one risk I think is very much overplayed - the risk of deflation and the problem of being
without monetary tools to deal with it. I have already discussed the (lack of) evidence for a deflation cliff near
the lower bound for interest rates. Is there yet a significant risk that being near the lower bound with low
inflation can lead to de-anchoring of inflation expectations and a downward deflationary tendency?

There is not much evidence from recent levels of inflation expectations in the UK that this is a substantial
risk.

Chart 9 shows that inflation expectations 2, 3 and 4 years ahead in the UK are close to the inflation target.
The drift in short term expectations in the euro area has been somewhat more pronounced, though
expectations of inflation five years ahead are only 0.1 p.p. below their pre-crises average. To my mind there
are no clear signs that the recent low inflation – driven significantly by falls in commodity prices that boost
spending power – are creating significant risks of self-perpetuating deflation. I think it has been right to leave
monetary policy unchanged as inflation in the UK fell sharply to zero and even dipped beneath it, just as it
was right not to change policy when inflation temporarily rose to above 5 percent in the Autumn of 2011.
“Don’t just do something, stand there… (and think)” has not been such a bad piece of advice.

Where might the path of Bank Rate be heading?
By early 2018 – according to our May Inflation Report central forecast – the UK economy will have been
growing at about its long run average rate for the best part of 4 years; spare capacity will have long gone,
and the impact of commodity price changes and exchange rate changes will have largely fallen out of the
inflation figures. 1.3% was the level of Bank Rate for early 2018 implied by market yields at the time of the
May Inflation Report. At that level of Bank Rate, would inflation be steady at close to target or instead rising
away from it?

That question could be couched in terms of so called r* (the appropriate interest rate to keep inflation on
track and demand in line with productive capacity) or about persistent headwinds to demand. I can see a set
of factors that would make you think that the appropriate level of Bank Rate consistent with the target then
(early 2018) was significantly lower than in the past – some of these factors are global, some much more UK
specific.

Let me mention 4, not entirely independent ones, and consider how big they might be 3 years from now

1. Higher credit spreads
2. Fiscal headwinds
3. Secular stagnation – which is to some extent a global phenomenon
4. Demographics
Credit spreads – Credit spreads are higher than they were in the years leading up to the crash. But they
have fallen sharply over recent years (Charts 1, 2 and 3). My own assessment of this factor is that it is now
worth maybe 50-75bp when turned into a Bank Rate equivalent, and that is relative to the 1997-2007
average.
Fiscal headwinds – Estimating how great a drag on growth fiscal adjustments have been is fiendishly difficult,
in part because it involves specifying a counterfactual path for taxes and spending. Using Bank economic
models I estimate that if the government sticks to its budget plans by 2018 fiscal headwinds might have
knocked about 0.9% off the level of output. Fiscal policy may be dragging on annual growth by around
0.2 – 0.3% in each of the next three years. To offset that, Bank Rate might need to be around 75bps lower.
Global secular stagnation – One version of this is presented by Summers (2015) which states that the desire
to save relative to the incentive to invest will be persistently greater than it used to be. It’s not clear why this
would be so, and I am doubtful it holds in the UK. We have a low household saving rate and it has been on a
falling trajectory for the past few years. UK investment has been weak but we have had slack in the
economy, and that will probably be largely gone by 2018. It is very hard to know how much of the very low
level of real interest rates across the world in recent years is a temporary (albeit quite persistent)

phenomenon and how much is due to secular stagnation. Maybe it is nonetheless as big a head wind in the
UK as fiscal drag. It is hard to tell. If that were right we should knock another 50 to 75bp off the old r*.
Demographics – The effect on savings of demographic transitions has also been invoked as a major factor
for explaining falling real interest rates. Carvalho & Ferrero (2015) present a model in which the aging
population, particularly through increasing longevity, leads to a decrease in r* and argue that empirically it
can explain Japan’s persistent deflation experience. I am sceptical about the effect of demographics,
particularly in explaining a large change in r* in such a short period. And the demographic trends in the UK
are nowhere near as pronounced as in Japan or some other European economies.

Now this is all rather subjective and back of the envelope. But taking my crude estimates of how much the
equilibrium neutral interest rate might have fallen it adds up to between 175bp and 250bp. That is what one
might knock off the old neutral Bank Rate, which I think was somewhere around 5% (nominal). That would
give one a range for nominal r* at the start of 2018 of between about 2.5% and a bit above 3%. This is some
way north of the conditioning assumption used at the time of the May Inflation Report of just under 1.5%.

One has to be humble here; no one should feel certain of the right answer. As always there are
unpredictable things that can have a significant impact on the appropriate monetary policy; no-one today can
be at all sure how recent events in Greece and China will impact the UK. But r* a couple of years down the
road is, to my mind, clearly higher than 0.5%, though likely significantly below the old “normal”. If you pushed
me for a figure I would say 3% or so. And a gradual path to that level is what I would chose if I had to set the
path of Bank Rate now; and by “gradual” I do not mean that it takes 10 years to get there.
But of course we don’t have to fix a path for Bank Rate – the MPC sets today’s Bank Rate. Yet waiting too
long to start on a path back to a more sustainable rate is a bad mistake. What you really need to avoid is
sharp rises in interest rates. The cost of raising interest rate sharply is particularly high in the UK, where a
large proportion of household debt is in the form of variable interest rate mortgages and where many people
would struggle to adjust to sudden and significant rises in monthly payments. Given that, and given that
many of the after effects of the mess of 2008 do seem to have faded (e.g. the drying up of bank credit), I
think a first move up in Bank Rate soon is likely to be right. I do not attach great weight to the idea that
starting this process will create great risks of dropping back into very weak growth, falling into negative
inflation and engendering a splurge in risk avoiding behaviour. I attach more weight to the risks of waiting
too long and then not being able to take a gradual path to a more normal stance for monetary policy.

One thing the MPC will not do (and never has) is just follow another big central bank; it is a daft idea that we
cannot raise rates in the UK before the US and also cannot be long behind them.
The time to start normalisation is soon; that is not something to shrink from. I have been called a “dove” in
the past, even an “arch-dove” so some might think it bizarre for me to say this. But they should not; the

“hawk – dove” labels are pretty silly because they suggest some unchanging genetic tendency towards
favouring one type of policy; anyone who was like that would be very ill suited to be on the MPC. In some
ways the “doves and hawks” stuff is just a harmless shorthand; but there are times when it is (as
H L Mencken rather nicely put it) a geyser of pish-posh. As conditions change you change your view on what
is right; and things have changed a lot in the UK in the past year or so and very largely for the better. Now is
closer to the right time to start a gentle amble back towards a more normal setting for monetary policy.

Conclusions:

1. The best way to handle the risks of incurring huge costs from another financial crisis is to control
leverage in the financial sector.

2. Using interest rates to do that is not as efficient as the more direct route of using capital requirements;
there is not a strong case for having monetary policy routinely directed towards preserving financial
stability.

3. There is little evidence that the risk of deflationary spirals become very large at interest rates close to the
effective lower bound.

4. We are now close to the time when it is appropriate to raise rates.

APPENDIX:

Here is a simple model to illustrate the tendency for unregulated outcomes to create too much risky bank
lending.

Suppose every bank has the opportunity to invest in a portfolio of loans that will provide a good-state return
(yh ) with probability p, and a bad-state return (yl ) with probability 1 − p. Assume that the probability of
success (p) is uniformly distributed between the interval [0,1]. Banks can find out that probability before they
lend. Each bank’s probability of success p𝑖 is a private signal known only to itself that cannot be credibly
communicated to its depositors. Depositors are nevertheless aware of the probability distribution for p and
are capable of figuring out the incentives involved. All agents are risk neutral, and have access to a risk-free
Central Bank deposit facility which remunerates funds at the policy rate 1 + 𝑟.
Let 𝑒 denote the equity of a bank as a percentage of its total assets. This is perfectly observed by depositors.
Normalising total assets to 1 means that a bank with 𝑒𝑖 will need to raise (1 − 𝑒𝑖 ) in deposits. It does so by
offering a promised a rate of interest to depositors (𝑅) that is greater than the outside option available (𝑟).
We assume further that in the bad state a bank would not be able to honour its debt obligations, such that
depositors will only get yl instead of the promised return (1 − 𝑒)(1 + 𝑅) – in other words holders of bank
equity have limited liability. Given the presence of both asymmetric information and limited liability, it can be
shown that the promised rate on deposits (𝑅) will be a function of a bank’s capital (𝑒), and that banks with
lower starting capital are more prone to excessive risk taking.

For banks to be maximising their profit the following condition holds:
𝑝̂ (𝑦ℎ − (1 − 𝑒)(1 + 𝑅)) = 𝑒(1 + 𝑟)
Where p̂ is the lowest acceptable p for the bank to actually engage in lending. If p𝑖 < 𝑝̂ then the bank
would prefer to forego the opportunity to lend and simply deposit its funds at the central bank facility.
Note that 𝑝̂ will be a function of 𝑒.

Depositors will require the following condition to hold:
(1 + 𝑝̂ )
(1 + 𝑝̂ )
((1 − 𝑒)(1 + 𝑅)) + (1 −
) 𝑦𝑙 = (1 − 𝑒)(1 + 𝑟)

is the depositors’ conditional expectation of p given that p > p̂. The left hand side of this

equation is the expected return on bank deposits; the right hand side is what money deposited at the
central bank earns.
So we have two equations, and two unknowns p̂ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑅 (both non-linear functions of 𝑒).

A numerical illustration:

Suppose banks start out with capital of 2.5%. The good-state outcome on bank lending is 1.15; the bad-state
outcome is 0.75; and the safe rate available at Bank of England is 5%.

What is the efficient outcome?
The first-best threshold 𝑝̂𝑓𝑏 (the cut-off point for p if banks were 100% equity funded, or if p was perfectly
observed by households) is defined by:
𝑝̂𝑓𝑏 × (1.15) + (1 − 𝑝̂𝑓𝑏 ) × (0.75) = 1.05
So 𝑝̂𝑓𝑏 = 0.75. Ideally any lending which has a probability of success less than this level will not be done. So
the average p of all banks engaged in lending activities (the conditional expectation of p given that p > p̂) is
0.875, which is half way between the lowest acceptable success probability of 0.75 and the best possible of
1. This means about 12.5% of loans do not pay off in full. That is the efficient level of risk-taking, it is what we
would want banks to do.
What level of p do banks find acceptable given asymmetric information and limited liabilities?

For simplicity, suppose for now that depositors are unsophisticated and will only demand a promised interest
rate of 5% on deposits (the same as the risk-free rate at the central bank). Then at a gearing of 40
(=1/0.025), the answer is:
𝑝̂ × (1.15 − (0.975) × (1.05)) = 0.025 × (1.05)
So 𝑝̂ is only 0.21 ! The average p observed in the banking sector is then only 0.6 (half way between 0.21 and
1), so that fully 40% of loans do not pay off in full. This is hugely more risky lending than is optimal.

Now this assumes dumb behaviour of depositors. So suppose depositors are smart and risk-neutral. What
would the equilibrium then look like? (i.e. What is the solution when you solve the two non-linear optimality
conditions?)

The calculations involved are a bit more complicated (and this is what Du and Miles (2014) is all about). But
the answer is that the lowest acceptable 𝑝 at a level of equity funding of 2.5% of total assets (so a leverage
ratio of 40) is 0.55. This means the average success rate on loans is 78% – much lower than the right
degree of risk-taking which would make the proportion of loans that pay off in full about 88% (the first-best
scenario).
This leads to the simple thought experiment, what happened when either 𝑟 or 𝑒 is increased? Here is what
happens when you raise 𝑒:

We get nearer to the “right” answer for the average success probability observed in the banking sector
(0.875) by raising e. If we get e up to 10%, the average p becomes 82% and R drops from over 13% to
under 10%. If we go for 20% equity funding the average p is now close to the efficient level (86% relative to
the first-best level of 87.5%); the rate that is offered on deposits now falls to 6.9%.

How about using monetary policy to get the right level of risk taking in the banking sector? The table below
shows the impact of raising the rate set by the central bank above its assumed neutral level of 5% (leaving
leverage at 40).

At 6% the proportion of good loans raises to 80%, but the interest rate banks need to offer on deposits goes
up to almost 13.5%. To get the proportion of good loans up to 86% (something which could be achieved at
an unchanged interest rate but with a capital requirement of 20%) means the central bank needs to raise the
interest rates from 5% to 9% and the interest rate offered on bank deposits has to be just over 14%.
In practice one can use a mix of monetary policy (raising 𝑟) and capital requirements (raising 𝑒). Our work
suggest that on the whole using a lot higher equity requirements and not using 𝑟 much is best for overall
economic activity.
