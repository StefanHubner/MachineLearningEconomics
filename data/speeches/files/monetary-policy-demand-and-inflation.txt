Monetary Policy, Demand and Inflation
Summary
1. To understand inflation prospects, first consider where demand is
relative to potential supply. Second, analyse growth prospects relative to
trend. Then combine these to gain some idea of underlying inflationary
pressures going forward. In addition, consider whether recent relative
price changes, notably the rise in oil prices and the rise in import price
inflation, are generating second round effects via wage bargaining. So
what is the situation?
2. After 18 months of below trend growth, there is a modest degree of
spare capacity in the UK economy.
3. Looking forward, it seems probable that the growth of demand will
approach trend levels in early 2006. However, it is less probable that
demand growth further out will move above trend, which it must do if the
spare capacity is to be eliminated. In summary, there is unlikely to be
enough excess demand in the economy going forward to generate any
serious underlying inflationary pressure.
4. What of the oil price effect? Because oil prices stopped trending
upwards in August 2005 and are not expected to trend up next year, the
impact of the recent doubling of oil prices on CPI inflation is now fading.
And in the absence of second round effects, which have not appeared so
far, the oil price effect will continue to fade.
5. The combination of the fading oil price effect and the absence of
underlying inflationary pressure leads to CPI inflation undershooting the

3

target further out if rates had been left on hold. Hence my votes for a rate
cut in December and January.
6. There are some upside risks to inflation. Oil prices may continue to
trend up in 2006, perhaps because of some supply disturbance interacting
with the inexorable demand increase. Second round wage effects may
appear in the 2006 wage round.

Finally, a continuing increase in

wholesale gas prices may have a big enough impact further out to prevent
the inflation undershoot. These risks were not, in my view, important
enough to postpone a rate cut.

1. Introduction
In the December and January meetings of the Monetary Policy
Committee I voted for a 25 bps reduction in the interest rate. In what
follows are my views on inflation prospects. Before getting down to the
details, it is worth remarking on the relationship between inflation and
prospects for demand in the economy.
After an interview I gave to the Financial Times (23 September), I was
ticked off on the letters page for focussing on growth when the MPC is
supposed to be targeting inflation. Then, at a meeting of the House of
Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs (25 October 2005), Lord
Lawson of Blaby remarked that he was very glad to hear the Governor
reaffirm once again that the MPC was emphatically targeting inflation
and not targeting activity (House of Lords, 2005, Question 15). Lord
Lawson went on to add “…, few things could do more harm to
inflationary expectations than a feeling that you did not have your eye
very firmly on one ball and that maybe your attention had wandered
equally between activity and inflation” (House of Lords, 2005, Question
16).
The factor driving changes in inflation over the longer term is the level of
demand in the economy relative to the potential supply. If the former
exceeds the latter, then we may expect inflation to be rising, and vice
versa. In the light of this fact, what is one to make of the previous
remarks? It is plain that if you are trying to hit an inflation target, you
have to form a judgment about the level of demand in the economy
relative to potential supply and how it is likely to move. This must,
among other things, involve making judgments about growth prospects,
not for their own sake but because they are vital when it comes to
understanding the prospects for inflation. It is absolutely necessary to

5

keep your eye on all the factors which affect future inflation, including
growth prospects, if you wish to hit the inflation target. And, of course,
keeping your eye on something is not the same as targeting it.
The level of demand relative to potential output is not the only factor
determining inflation. Over the short run, measured inflation is strongly
influenced by relative price shocks. And these may be substantial, like
the recent doubling of the price of oil, or the fall in the prices of imported
goods following the huge appreciation of sterling in 1996/7, or the
significant rise in the prices of goods subject to VAT after the 1979
Budget. To hit the inflation target, the MPC has to take these things on
board as well as the underlying inflationary forces generated by the
position of demand relative to potential supply.
The extent to which the MPC will take account of these relative price
effects when setting interest rates will depend on how long their impact
on consumer price inflation is expected to last.

If the impact of a

particular relative price change fades rapidly it will be ignored, because
any change in monetary policy would not have any significant effect on
inflation before the impact of the relative price change disappears. So
what sort of factors will make relative price effects last? A first point
which is sometimes important is that a relative price effect will have an
impact over a number of years if people are uncertain about whether the
relative price change will be permanent.

For example, sterling

appreciated by around 25% in 1996/7. For foreign producers selling in
the UK market, this was like a 25% reduction in the sterling costs of
production. The decision they had to make was how much to cut prices
as a consequence and over what period. Because they were uncertain
how long this shift in sterling was going to be sustained, they only cut
prices gradually and import price inflation was still negative in 1999,

6

continuing to push down on consumer price inflation well after the shift
in the exchange rate.
The second mechanism which is important in prolonging the impact of
relative price changes is when wage settlements respond rapidly to
changes in consumer price inflation. So if a rise in the relative price of a
set of goods raises consumer price inflation and this feeds through rapidly
in wage inflation, then the resulting rise in cost inflation will feed back
into further price inflation ultimately generating a wage-price spiral.
These second round effects of a rise in relative prices will thus generate
further increases in price inflation which will ultimately necessitate a
monetary policy response.
So when are these second round effects likely to occur? The answer is in
situations where the monetary policy regime has no credibility and
inflation expectations are not well anchored. A classic example happened
after the large rise in VAT in the Budget of June 1979. Partly as a
consequence of this, RPI inflation to rise from around 10% to over 15%
by September with the consequences illustrated in Figure 1.

Wage

inflation responded almost immediately, fed back into price inflation and
by June 1980, RPI inflation had reached 21.5%. A dramatic tightening of
monetary policy and a huge rise in unemployment was required to get
inflation down again and even so it did not fall below 10% until June
1982. By contrast, if inflation expectations are anchored on an inflation
target, a rise in consumer price inflation generated by some relative price
increase is less likely to feed through into pay settlements because of the
general belief that inflation will return to target. I argue in what follows
that, so far, wage inflation has not responded significantly to the recent
rise in oil prices so there have been no second round effects and,

7

consequently, the implications for monetary policy of the oil price
increase are few.
To summarise, in order to understand inflation prospects today, I must
consider first, where demand is today relative to potential supply. Then I
see what can be said about growth prospects relative to trend. These two
combined will give some idea of underlying inflationary pressures. On
top of this, I must consider the extent to which the recent rise in oil prices
and, more generally, recent increases in import price inflation, having fed
through into consumer price inflation are generating second round effects
via wage bargaining. This more or less describes the remainder of this
paper. I conclude with my overall judgment on the prospects for inflation
and its implications for monetary policy.
2. The UK Economy, Where are we Today?
As I have already noted, prospects for inflation will depend crucially on
demand in the economy relative to potential supply (the output gap), both
today and going forward. So where are we today? In Figure 2, various
measures of the output gap are presented and the overall impression is
that there is some spare capacity available in the economy at present.
Looking a little more deeply at this notion of spare capacity, there are two
important aspects. First, there is spare capacity within companies, which
basically refers to the ability of the company to supply more output
without having to buy more machines in the case of a manufacturer or
purchase more selling space in the case of a retailer or hire more
professionals in the case of business services provider. Second, there is
spare capacity in the labour market which implies that there are
individuals not currently employed who are willing and able to assist in
the expansion of existing capacity by, for example, manning an extra shift
or increasing the number of professionals in a business services company.

8

To capture the first of these two aspects, in Figure 3, it appears that
capacity utilisation rates, in both manufacturing and services, have fallen
away since 2004 and now stand close to their average levels over the last
decade. So companies have a degree of spare capacity at least relative to
2004.

In the labour market, the claimant count measure of

unemployment has risen steadily over the last year and the LFS measure
has turned up rather sharply in recent months (see Figure 4). So there is
also some spare capacity in the labour market.
Overall, therefore, the picture is fairly clear. There is a degree of spare
capacity available in the UK economy as of today. So what does this
imply for inflation prospects? First, the existence of some spare capacity
ensures that underlying inflationary pressures are modest. Second, some
period of above trend growth, which will reduce the extent of spare
capacity, is consistent with hitting the inflation target in the longer term.
Third, the precise outcome for inflation will also depend on the various
relative price factors mentioned in the previous section as well as the
presence or absence of second round effects. So in what follows, I shall
first consider current and future demand prospects, to see where demand
is expected to go relative to trend. Then I shall look at the other factors
which have to be added to the basic supply/demand effects to derive the
overall prospects for inflation.
3. Prospects for Demand Relative to Potential Supply
If I am going to pursue the question of demand prospects relative to
potential supply, it is worth starting by considering how rapidly potential
supply is expanding. The general view is that the trend growth of GDP in
the UK is currently around 2.7%. There are some uncertainties here
relating to the extent of immigration of potential employees, the prospects
for productivity growth in the light of the recent decline in productivity

9

growth rates and the implications for supply potential of recent rises in
fuel prices.

Overall, however, treating the trend growth of potential

output as 2.7% per annum is a reasonable assumption so long as we
recognise the uncertainty here. Turning now to demand prospects, I start
with the world economy.
The World Economy
Because the UK exports over one quarter of what it produces, it is
important to have some idea of world demand. In Figure 5, it appears
that economic growth in the world economy is relatively buoyant,
although somewhat less so if the countries are weighted by their
importance to UK exporters. The problem here, as can be seen in Figure
6, is that the Euro area, which takes a disproportionate share of UK
exports (over 50%), has been performing less well than the other major
economies. However, the Euro area is on the road to recovery and so
world demand prospects look reasonably strong.

Equity markets

certainly think so (see Figure 7) and oil prices have flattened off in the
last few months (see Figure 8). Of course, there are risks to this relatively
benign outcome. Will the excess of savings over investment in Asia and
the Middle East continue to finance the US current account deficit, as
well as helping to sustain long-term real interest rates at historically low
levels? Will oil and other commodity prices continue to remain relatively
stable despite strong growth in the world economy? Despite these risks,
my best guess would be that the world demand for UK products will
probably grow reasonably strongly over the next few years. Certainly
more strongly than the average of the last few years.

10

The UK Economy
In Figure 9, the path of UK GDP is presented. Even were the recent data
to be revised up, the broad overall picture is unlikely to change
dramatically.

Since the middle of 2004, UK GDP growth has been

somewhat below trend. This is consistent with the finding in the previous
section that the extent of spare capacity in the UK was rising over exactly
the same period. So what happened in the middle of 2004? Let us look
first at household consumption, which makes up more than 60% of GDP.
Consumption
Not surprisingly, in the light of what has just been discussed, household
consumption growth started to fall in the middle of 2004 (see Figure 10)
although there is some evidence of a recovery later in 2005, confirmed by
the retail sales data (Figure 11). So why was there a significant shift in
mid-2004?

Perhaps the most important factor was the significant

slowdown in real post-tax labour income growth over the same period.
As can be seen in Figure 12, since 2000, household consumption growth
has tended to track post-tax labour income growth with a bit of delay. So
why did real post-tax labour income growth slow down, particularly as
there was no significant slowdown in either earnings growth or
employment growth? The answer is first, the sharp rise in consumer
price inflation driven by oil prices and second, the fact that the effective
tax on personal incomes rose particularly rapidly over this period (see
Figure 13) mostly without any increases in official tax rates (other than
Council Tax). The factors underlying this rise in effective tax rates were
composition effects (eg. incomes among those in the high tax band rose
faster than average) and the fact that the tax bands in the income tax
system are indexed to price inflation, not wage inflation.

11

Other factors associated with the slowdown of household consumption
growth since the middle of 2004 have been the sharp decline in house
price inflation (see Figure 14) and the rise in short-term interest rates
from late 2003 to August 2004. The latter effect was probably bigger
than in the past because of the historically high levels of household debt
in the UK1.
So what are the prospects for consumption going forward? So long as
employment and earnings growth continue at existing rates, then real
post-tax labour income growth will revert to normal levels because
average tax rates are not expected to rise in the future as rapidly as in the
immediate past (see Figure 13). In the light of this and barring serious
adverse shocks, consumption growth should increase towards more
normal levels. Indeed, the latest data on retail sales and from the British
Retail Consortium suggest this is starting to happen.
Investment
Aside from government investment, fixed capital investment growth in
the UK has been weak over the last year, consistent with the overall
slowdown in domestic demand (see Figure 15).

So what are the

prospects for investment growth going forward? Since both business
optimism and investment intentions have been declining since 2004 (see
Figure 16), the prognosis for investment growth is relatively modest.
Government Consumption
Luckily for the MPC, the Treasury reveals its plans for nominal
government spending for some years to come. The numbers suggest that
nominal spending on goods and services as well as on government
employees will grow steadily at around 6% per annum until April 2008
after which it will slow down. Public sector employment growth has,

12

however, been slowing over the last two years and is expected to settle at
a lower level going forward.
Imports and Exports
The general picture over the last 18 months has been a slowdown in the
growth of imports and a slight increase in the growth of exports (see
Figure 17). Given a relatively stable exchange rate, the force underlying
the slowdown of import growth is probably the recent weakness of
domestic demand, particularly the demand for consumer durables and
investment goods which have a very high import content (in excess of 60
per cent). Export growth has probably been assisted by the rise in UK
weighted world GDP growth since 2003 (see Figure 5).

Looking

forward, we may expect export growth to remain relatively strong as UK
weighted world GDP growth will probably remain buoyant. On the other
hand, import growth can be expected to recover as consumption growth
moves towards more normal levels. Indeed, in 2005 Q3, there is already
some sign of this happening as both import growth and the growth of
expenditure on consumer durables increased significantly.
Future prospects for net trade are highly uncertain. In so far as the
recovery in net trade in the last year has depended on the weakness of
expenditure on consumer durables and capital goods, this recovery may
be expected partially to reverse as consumption growth goes back to
normal. However, since growth in the UK weighted world will probably
remain strong, stronger than over the last three years, on average, the
prognosis for net trade is perhaps a little stronger than it has been over the
last few years. But given a stable exchange rate, it will probably still act
as a drag on overall GDP growth. Perhaps a bit less of a drag than has
been the case in the last few years.

13

Overall Demand
The overall picture is one where demand in the UK will move back
towards trend rates driven by some recovery in household consumption
growth and strong government expenditure growth. Weaker investment
growth may hold things back a little but given the strength of UK
weighted world growth prospects, net trade may be a little less of a drag
on GDP growth than it has been in recent years. The key issue for
underlying UK inflation is whether or not growth prospects are strong
enough relative to trend to reduce the existing level of spare capacity and
generate rising inflationary pressure. Given the relatively weak prospects
for investment and the fact that consumption growth is unlikely to move
significantly above normal levels, it seems unlikely that government
spending and net trade will make a strong enough contribution to get UK
demand growth significantly above trend.

Overall, therefore, the

probability that the balance of supply and demand will generate
significant additional inflationary pressure over the next three years
seems relatively low.
4. Pipeline Pressures, Relative Price Effects and the Overall
Inflationary Picture
The most important recent change in relative prices has been the rise in
the price of oil (see Figure 8). After increasing continuously from early
2004, the oil price has flattened off since August 2005 and is expected to
remain relatively stable over the next couple of years according to the
forward curve. There is, however, a lot of uncertainty about this. The oil
price feeds more or less directly into consumer prices via the price of
petrol and indirectly via the prices of goods which require oil in their
production. Taking lags into account, the impact of these shifts in the oil
price was to generate upward pressure on CPI inflation from late 2004
until late 2005. Subsequently, because oil prices were no longer trending

14

upwards after August 2004, the upward pressure on inflation switched to
downward pressure after September 2005. This kind of switch happens
because if, for example, the price of petrol was rising this time last year
but is stable or falling today, this will exert downward pressure on the
current annual inflation rate. This downward pressure on inflation will
probably continue for some time and explains why the MPC’s inflation
forecast in the November Inflation Report has inflation tending to fall in
2006.
The fact that a significant and permanent rise in the price of oil only leads
to a temporary jump in measured inflation is a consequence of the
absence of second round effects. As noted in the first section, second
round effects arise typically when wage settlements and earnings respond
rapidly to movements in consumer price inflation2. If this happens, a rise
in consumer price inflation will raise wage inflation. This will impact on
cost inflation, generating a second round rise in price inflation. A wageprice spiral then gets underway and consumer price inflation moves
steadily upwards despite the fact that the oil price is no longer rising.
So far, we have not seen second round effects in response to the rises in
consumer price inflation from mid 2004, as we can see from the relative
stability of earnings growth and settlements in response to fluctuations in
price inflation3, or indeed in response to the recent sharp rise in effective
tax rates (see Figure 18).
Given that the other main source of relative price movements, the sterling
exchange rate, has remained pretty stable in recent years, are there are
any inflationary pressures in the pipeline?

Domestic goods price

inflation, excluding petroleum products, has been moving steadily down
since 2004 (see Figure 19).

Import price inflation, excluding fuel

15

products, has been relatively stable (see Figure 20). CIPS service price
balance has risen a little recently, although it is still down on its level in
the first half of 2004 (see Figure 21). Overall, there does not seem to be
any strong inflationary pressure in the supply pipeline.
5. The Overall Picture on Inflation Prospects
After about 18 months of below trend growth, there is some modest
degree of spare capacity in the UK economy. Looking forward, it seems
probable that the growth of demand will approach trend levels early in
2006. However, it is less probable that demand growth further out will
move above trend, which it must do if the spare capacity is to be
eliminated. In the light of this, there is unlikely to be enough excess
demand in the economy going forward to generate any serious upward
move in underlying inflation. The other major contribution to inflation
prospects is provided by the recent doubling of the price of oil. Because
oil prices stopped trending upwards in August 2005 and are not expected
to trend upwards next year, the impact of this event on CPI inflation is
now fading. And, in the absence of second round effects, which have not
appeared so far, the oil price effect will continue to fade.

The

combination of this with the low probability that excess demand in the
economy going forward will generate any serious upward move in
underlying inflation, implies that inflation is more likely than not to come
in below target for some time, once the oil price effect washes out. In
order to get inflation up towards target further out, a cut in interest rates
was required.
One final point is worth noting. A further significant prospective relative
price change has appeared on the horizon, namely the rise in UK
wholesale gas prices from 2005 to 2006 which is implicit in the forward
market. This shift would raise CPI inflation in 2006. However, again if

16

there are no second round effects, CPI inflation would then tend to fall
back further out, once gas prices stop rising.

17

Footnotes
1. Of course, when interest rates go up, while debtors must pay more,
creditors have higher incomes so they can spend more. The net
effect of higher rates on UK consumption is negative because
debtors typically have a higher propensity to spend than creditors
and not all creditors live in the UK.
2. This is a special case of what is generally termed “real wage
resistance”.

This happens when employees resist falls in real

wages by raising wage demands in response to any changes that
tend to cut real pay. These changes include not only rises in
consumer price inflation but rises in effective income tax rates.
3. We use the retail price index (RPI) in this context because surveys
of wage bargaining indicate that wage bargainers overwhelmingly
use RPI as their measure of rises in the cost of living rather than
CPI.
