SPEECH IN ASHFORD, KENT, 16 JANUARY 2006
Two weeks ago Trafalgar Square was packed with revellers celebrating the New Year. A
century ago it was crowded with hop-growers and pickers. On May 16th 1908 – “Hop
Saturday” – around 30,000 people working in the hop trade travelled to London to
demonstrate against unfair foreign competition and to demand the introduction of a tariff
on imported hops. It was the largest demonstration in Trafalgar Square for many years.
Special trains were laid on to London Bridge from where the demonstrators marched to
Trafalgar Square, accompanied by bands playing and banners flying. According to the
Times, “One of the most conspicuous banners bore the words: ‘And shall hops picked by
Chinamen make England's hop trade die, here's 50,000 Kentish men will know the reason
why’". Another, appropriately above the plinth of Nelson’s column, read “England
expects that every hop shall pay a duty”. A resolution was proposed demanding the
imposition of an import duty of 40 shillings per cwt on all foreign hops. Having carried
the resolution, the assembled gathering sang "Rule Britannia", after which the massed
bands played the National Anthem and a verse of "Auld Lang Syne".
Colourful and moving though the occasion was, the decline of the hop industry was
inexorable and inevitable. Nothing could stem the tide of changes in technology and in
tastes for new lighter – foreign - beers, and attempts by government through higher
excise duties to reduce the consumption of beer. A willingness to adapt and embrace,
rather than resist, change is the key to greater prosperity. That road may at times be hard
going – as I know many of you will have experienced in your own businesses - but it
leads ultimately to a more prosperous destination.
To follow the right road we need signposts. In a market economy those signposts are
movements in prices. If a particular product becomes more abundant or less in demand,
its price will fall relative to the prices of other products. That relative price change is the
signal which encourages consumers to buy more or producers to supply less. Over recent
years, three new signposts have appeared. They mark a process that has transformed

3
demand and supply conditions across the globe: the integration of China, India and other
emerging market economies into the world trading system.
The first signpost shows that prices of labour-intensive manufactured goods have fallen.
China, India and the former Soviet Union between them have massively increased the
supply of labour available to industry around the world. As labour-intensive goods have
become more abundant, they have also become cheaper. The signpost points us in a
familiar direction: the need to change what we produce. Were we still producing the
same labour-intensive goods as before, with output concentrated in industries like
agriculture (including hops), textiles, coal-mining and ship-building, we too would have
seen the price of our own output fall, just as it did for hop growers a century ago. Instead
we allowed output and employment to expand in those industries where we could exploit
a comparative advantage. In Kent, the expanding sectors include financial services,
transport (with 18 million tons of freight passing through the Channel Tunnel each year)
the exploitation of life sciences, and higher education (with five universities in the
county).
As consumers, we have benefited from falling prices of goods made in China and
elsewhere in Asia. Between 1995 and 2005, the prices of imported manufactured goods
fell by a sixth and, relative to the price of domestically produced output, by no less than a
third. So over the past decade we have been able to increase consumption by more than
the increase in production. Openness to the world economy has resulted in a higher
standard of living.
The second signpost marks the rise in oil and other commodity prices. Rapid growth of
production in China, India and other newly integrated economies has led to a substantial
rise in the demand for oil and other raw materials. Between 1995 and 2004, net imports
of oil to China rose by a factor of seven. Unlike earlier episodes of high oil prices, which
were driven largely by temporary supply constraints, the recent increase in the demand
for oil has been reflected in higher prices for future delivery as well as higher spot prices.
Similar rises are apparent in the market for gas. The signpost marked higher energy

4
prices points us towards ways of using less energy, to alternative energy sources and to
new sources of oil production such as the Canadian tar sands.
The first two signposts point us in the right direction. But the path has not been easy to
follow. We have seen movements – in both directions – in inflation, consumer spending
and output growth. Interest rates too have moved both up and down in order to maintain
overall stability of the economy by keeping consumer price inflation close to the 2%
target. The reasons for those changes have been explained in the minutes of the
Monetary Policy Committee meetings and in our Inflation Report. Tonight, I want to
look a little further ahead, to the challenges for monetary policy posed by a third signpost
– the recent fall in long-term interest rates. The development of an integrated world
capital market means that these now depend on savings and investment decisions
elsewhere in the world as well as here at home.
Investors seem to be willing to lend to governments at much lower interest rates than for
many a year. In some cases they have lent money for fifty years at around 4%, and the
interest rate on long-term UK government bonds is at its lowest level for over 50 years.
Low and stable inflation clearly explains much of the fall in long-term interest rates
which fell sharply when the Bank of England was made independent in 1997. But over
the past three to four years long-term interest rates around the world have fallen further to
remarkably low levels. In the UK, the annual interest rate on 20-year index-linked
government bonds, after allowing for anticipated future inflation, is now around 1%. For
most of the past 25 years, that so-called “real” rate of interest has varied between 2% and
4%. Long-term real interest rates of no more than 1% would normally be a signal to
spend more, save less, and to invest in physical as well as financial assets. But it is not at
all clear that rates will persist at such low levels. So is this particular signpost reliable?
There are broadly two types of explanation for the fall in long-term real rates around the
world. The first explains low interest rates as the outcome of an increased propensity to
save and lower willingness to invest in the world as a whole. The second explains them

5
as the result of rapid growth in money and credit which, in a “search for yield”, drives
asset prices up and interest rates down.
There is no doubt that in the past few years saving has been particularly high in the Asian
economies. In part, this reflects their wish to build up large balances in US dollars to
protect themselves from financial crises that several of them experienced in the 1990’s,
and also to maintain competitive exchange rates to allow export industries to absorb
surplus labour. For example, although China invests an extraordinary 45% of its national
income each year, it saves even more than this – 49% of national income in 2004. The
resulting current account surpluses have been saved overseas, much of them in US
government bonds. So, rather surprisingly, capital is flowing from some of the poorest
countries of the world to some of the richest. Moreover, the rise in oil prices has raised
the incomes of oil-producing countries, which have also chosen to save much of their
additional revenues in overseas financial assets. Those surplus savings have depressed
long-term real interest rates. In the industrialised world, consumers have realised that
this is a good time to borrow and spend, resulting in the “imbalances” evident in the
current account deficits of both the US and the UK.
Whether long-term real rates around 1% are sustainable is an interesting question, and
that uncertainty poses serious questions for monetary policy. On the one hand, the
increased propensity to save across the world could start to unwind. As their people
become more prosperous, domestic demand in China and elsewhere in Asia will become
the primary driver of those countries’ growth, so they may want to save less. And
business investment in the developed economies, which has been weak in recent years for
reasons we do not fully understand, may pick up as in previous recoveries. The resulting
rise in real interest rates and implied fall in asset prices would encourage the
industrialised world to save more. That would mean a shift of resources in those
countries away from domestic demand to net trade accompanied by a change in real
exchange rates. The “imbalances” in the world economy would start to unwind. Where
that would leave sterling and the outlook for inflation in the UK is impossible to know in
advance.

6

On the other hand, it is quite possible that real interest rates could remain low for some
time. Although there are signs of a pick-up in business investment in the US and Euro
area, investment remains weak in the UK and a recovery of world investment spending is
not assured. The growing recognition that increasing longevity will mean we need to
save more for retirement may sustain or even lift world saving rates. And pension funds
are now matching the risks of their assets with the risks of their future liabilities, thus
raising the demand for safer long-term financial assets such as index-linked government
bonds. Economists have long found it difficult to explain why, given the risks of equity
investments, governments should need to offer high real rates of return on their bonds in
a world of low and stable inflation. So perhaps the world capital market is returning to an
era of low real rates more akin to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. If annual
market rates on index-linked securities in the UK were to remain around 1%, then, with a
2% inflation target, the level of official interest rates required to balance overall demand
and supply would, in the long run, be lower than was thought necessary in the past few
decades.
Even if we knew that long-term interest rates were low because of a change in the
balance of saving and investment in the world, judging the appropriate level of interest
rates would be a challenge. But monetary policy is made more difficult by the fact that
there is another, very different, explanation of recent low long-term interest rates. Rapid
growth of money – as central banks have kept official interest rates very low – has helped
to push up asset prices as investors “search for yield”. Data from the IMF suggest that
world broad money in 2003 and 2004 was growing at its fastest rate since the late 1980s.
Across the world, the prices of all kinds of assets have risen - not just of government
bonds, but also of equities, houses and other real estate, commodities and gold and other
precious metals.
Moreover, risk premia have become unusually compressed and the expansion of money
and credit may have encouraged investors to take on more risk than hitherto without
demanding a higher return. It is questionable whether such behaviour can persist. At

7
some point the ratio of asset prices to the prices of goods and services will revert to more
normal levels. That could come about in one of two ways: either the prices of goods and
services rise to “catch up” with asset prices as the increased money leads to higher
inflation, or asset prices fall back as markets reassess the appropriate levels of risk
premia. In neither case would it be easy to keep inflation close to the 2% target.
I do not pretend to know whether the signpost of low levels of long-term interest rates is
primarily related to underlying preferences for saving and investment, or to the global
growth of money and a possible under-pricing of risk, or, in all probability, to some
combination of the two. Nor, since we do not know the causes of low long-term rates,
can we be sure for how long they will persist. Monetary policy will, therefore, need to be
alert to the information contained in a wide range of asset prices, to be forward-looking in
its aim of maintaining low and stable inflation, and to be ready to respond to changes in
the signposts.
The remarkable degree of stability that the UK economy has enjoyed over the past decade
has been less evident over the past twelve months. Growth slowed and inflation rose
above target. But after a period driving along a smooth new highway, a change to a more
challenging road surface does not, as I said recently to the House of Lords Economic
Affairs Committee, mean that the wheels are coming off the economy; rather, it tells us
that there are somewhat more and somewhat larger bumps on the road. Monetary policy
can try to avoid some of the worst bumps, but it cannot ensure a flat road surface.
Nevertheless, growth has picked up and inflation has fallen back close to its 2% target.
Our central view remains one of steady growth and low inflation. But there are risks to
that central view emanating from the rest of the world and we shall watch developments
in world capital markets carefully. By keeping inflation close to the target, and so doing
what it can to maintain economic stability, the Monetary Policy Committee aims to allow
you and other businesses to follow the signposts which guide a market economy.
I cannot finish without reminding you that tomorrow is the 300th anniversary of the birth
of Benjamin Franklin, arguably the greatest of the American founding fathers. During

8
his lengthy stays in England, Benjamin Franklin visited Kent many times. To celebrate
his tercentenary the American Brewing Association has produced a new recipe for
Franklin’s favourite beer. The hops recommended for the recipe are Kent Goldings.
Despite the fears of the demonstrators on Hop Saturday in 1908, the Kent hop industry
has not disappeared altogether. The area under planting is certainly much smaller, but
research in centres such as Wye College has produced the new hedgerow hops which are
recognised worldwide. Employment in Kent, though, has moved into new and more
productive sectors. Adapting to changes in the external environment is not easy for any
of us – whether running a business or setting monetary policy - but if we do adjust the
benefits will accrue, if not to everyone immediately then to the great majority over the
years to come.
