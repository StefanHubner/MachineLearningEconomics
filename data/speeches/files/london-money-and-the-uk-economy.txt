Introduction

The past year has been one of rapid growth and record profits for much of the financial sector
worldwide. The strength of the world economy has provided a favourable wind but the
spectacular growth of derivative markets and the spate of leveraged buy outs have also fuelled
the growth. And, of course, London has been at the centre of the story.

In a speech in March I discussed the renewed ascent of London as a centre of international
finance and concluded that it was based on powerful economic forces which were likely to
persist.1 I showed how the leading position London built up in the days when Britannia ruled
the waves gave it a strong comparative advantage based on language, law, time zone and,
above all, by a concentration of expert labour. This allowed London to maintain an important
role in international finance even while Britain’s overall economic and political position was
eroded. In the last twenty years we have seen a resurgence in the City which has established a
strong position not just in traditional markets like foreign exchange, where its share is around
30% of trading, but in new products, with a share in OTC derivatives markets over 40%.2 The
rapid growth of hedge funds in the West End is the latest example of the innovation that this
cluster of financial skills has produced. You know something must be happening when the
Mayor of New York commissions a review of the threat London poses to New York’s position.

London’s recent growth certainly has a cyclical element but it also reflects two more structural
changes – the removal of barriers to international capital movements and the advances in
information technology. These have led to a growing role for international capital markets
compared to national banking and to a growing concentration of those markets in a few hubs
among which London and New York are dominant. And this finance revolution is still
underway. It is far more advanced in the US than in Europe and in Europe than in Asia. In the
absence of disasters therefore London, as the pre-eminent centre outside the US, can look
forward to a long period of fast growth and expect its share of the UK economy to increase.

I use “the City” here loosely to cover not just the Square Mile but the whole of London’s wholesale financial sector
including in Canary wharf and the West End. A fuller exposition would also give more attention to successful regional
centres including Edinburgh.

This evening I want to discuss the implications of that trend for the UK economy and for
economic policy. On the first, is London a goose laying golden eggs for the rest of the country
or is it more of a cuckoo in the nest? On the second, how does the growth of London and
financial markets generally impact on the Bank’s core functions of setting monetary policy and
maintaining financial stability. Finally I discuss the impact of financial developments on the
growth of money and credit and the significance of that for the broader economy.

London’s impact on the wider economy

In principle, when one sector of an economy enjoys rapid growth, we would expect to see three
broad developments:
•

rewards earned by factors which are specific to the booming industry
rise;

•

unless there are sufficient unemployed resources available, productive
resources shift into the booming industry; and

•

employment in other tradable goods industries falls.

The results were illustrated by the Dutch experience with gas in the 1960s and by the UK
experience with North Sea oil in the early 1980s.3 In both cases, part of the mechanism was a
rise in the real exchange rate and consequent pressure on other sectors.

Is that happening now in the UK? It is much harder to identify the impact of the City than the
impact of the discovery of gold or oil. London’s position has developed gradually and the
statistics rarely separate the group of wholesale financial markets and supporting legal,
accounting and other services that make London special from a broader group including retail
banking and insurance and business services. But there is some evidence that all three factors
are at work.

The story seems clearest with the specific factors of production. The cost of commercial
property in London, for example, has grown rapidly. According to Jones Lang Lasalle
Research, in the City average capital values are over $25,000 per sq.m, above both Paris and
New York. And the costs in the West End, the main home of the new hedge fund industry, are
3

The UK is a net exporter of financial services, running a surplus in 2006 of £26 billion (or 2% of GDP) on financial
services and insurance. North Sea oil production peaked in 1999, and in 2006 was nearly 40% below this peak.

almost twice as high. There is no doubt that the success of London’s financial centre is
helping to fuel demand for office space from Canary Wharf to Mayfair.

And of course it is not just commercial property in London that has been booming. House
price inflation in London has outstripped the rest of the UK (Chart 1), and in Kensington and
Chelsea average house prices have risen by almost 40% since the start of 2005, compared with
20% for Greater London as a whole. ECA International published a survey comparing
average monthly rents for a 70-square metre unfurnished flat in the largest cities and showed
London over € 2,100, compared with New York around € 1,750 and Paris below € 1,500.

The figures on output also show that London has been growing relative to the rest of the
country (Chart 2), and that has reflected the growth of financial and business services
compared with other tradable sectors throughout the UK (Chart 3 and Chart 4). And despite
the fall in oil production in the North Sea, we have seen a rise in the real exchange rate by over
15% when comparing the period 1987-1997 to 1997-2007, although of course the financial
sector would not have been the only factor behind that rise.

More immediately, the GDP figures in May showed that financial intermediation grew by 6%
in the sixth months to 2007 Q1 – an annual rate of over 13%. That is not the same as the City
of course; but there is every reason to think the City has been growing at least as fast as the
rest.

However, while the success of the City is currently one factor in these trends, it is not the
whole story. For a start there is a lot more to London than finance. There are other successful
industries and, on the other hand, London is home not just to the wealthiest boroughs but also
to some of the poorest and most deprived areas in the country. As a result it has one of the
highest regional rates of unemployment overall. Secondly employment and profits in the City
have been highly cyclical.

On scale first, a recent estimate put the total number employed in “City” jobs, including
supporting professions like lawyers and accountants as well as bankers and asset managers, at
around 340,000. That amounts to about 9% of the total in London; significant but still lower
than the number in distribution or in government services. And the growth of employment will
continue to be the net result from the expansion of activity and from the economies made

possible by IT and by the relocation particularly of back office work to cheaper areas
elsewhere in the UK or abroad.

The jobs figures understate the importance of the sector in the economy because on average
pay may be twice as high in the financial sector as in the rest of the economy; 9% of wages and
salaries in the year to March compared to 4% of employment. And within London its share is
even greater. The average earnings of someone working in London’s financial intermediation
sector in 2006 were around £90,000. On that basis, the financial sector might account for
around 20% of remuneration in London. However it is still far from the only game in town.
For example the Work Foundation’s fascinating new report on the creative industries suggests
that their growth has contributed at least as much as the City to London’s overall performance.

Moreover, while the trend is upwards, there is a marked cycle in the financial sector. Over the
last 10 years, for example there has been a striking swing in employment with rapid growth
during the dotcom boom followed by a sharp fall and subsequent recovery (Chart 5).

That reflects a strong cycle in financial sector profits (Chart 6) which is an international
phenomenon – indeed, in the last 10 years major European financial firms and US securities
dealers saw an even bigger cycle in their profitability than major UK financial firms (Chart 7).

The same is true for earnings (Chart 8). This reflects the importance of bonuses which account
for around 20% of remuneration in the financial sector compared with around 5% across the
economy as a whole. The figures in the City itself can be considerably higher. A figure of 50%
is common in investment banking, in which a rough rule of thumb is that firms distribute about
half their pre bonus profits to staff. It is estimated that 4200 workers in the City received
bonuses worth more than £1million in 2006/07.

Of course the growth in those bonuses is contributing to the widening inequality of incomes at
the top of the earnings distribution. Chart 9 compares the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile with the
median and shows that the main change is at the top. If we break that top percentile down
further, we see a more dramatic widening. This is not just true of the City or of the UK. The
average CEO in the UK earns around 100 times more than the average worker but there is an
even wider gap in the US, with the average pay of CEOs over 250 times that of the average
worker in 2005, having risen from around 100 times in 1995.

In 1999 Eddie George likened the change in the City since Big Bang to Wimbledon.4 The UK
still prospered by providing the venue even though most of the players were foreign.

Today I think the Premiership may provide an even better analogy. That is partly because
foreigners now own an increasing number of the venues as well as supplying many of the
players. That is a striking illustration of Britain’s openness to foreign ownership which sets it
some way apart from most other countries both in Europe and America. But it is also because
both the City and the Premiership have become the centres of global industries with a dramatic
impact on revenues and on earnings.

One of my first footballing heroes was Johnny Haynes, the David Beckham of his day as a
passer of a football. In the 1960s he became the first player to earn £100 per week (roughly
£1500 in today’s terms) in the British game which was then about four times the average male
wage. Top Premiership players now earn more than 200 times the average wage.

What has changed is the fact that pay is now being set in a world market. We have in the
Premiership as in the City some of the best paid people in an international industry which is
developing rapidly. We have imported the top of the world earnings scale and at a time when
the stretch at the top world wide is increasing very fast.

Just as in the Premiership, the stars of the City – the people who have not just the talent but the
recent experience and networks to perform at the top level today – can command a high
proportion of the returns from being at the hub of the industry. The growth of hedge funds
and private equity can be seen in part as a move by the small group who have sufficient
expertise in new instruments and markets to take more of the returns on ownership.5.

To sum up so far, internationalisation and technology favour the clustering of financial markets
in London so we should expect London to continue to prosper relative to the financial industry

E George, "Before the Millennium: From the City of London", 7 December 1999.
Even for a footballer, being at your peak at the right time and place is critical to earnings. But with football like
athletics, it is obvious that the best have outstanding talent. It is harder to believe the all the high earners in the City
are intrinsically more intelligent or determined than others whether in universities, hospitals or factories. But the
demand for the best paid reflects not just talent but experience. There may be many people who could run a trading
floor given the right training but there are inevitably only a few who can demonstrate current success in doing so.
Experience, like status and talent, is a “positional good”.

worldwide and to the rest of the UK economy. That will tend to reinforce the trends of recent
years with:
•

a continuing shift of resources into the financial markets and into
London itself,

•

a continuing pressure for higher rents and rewards for those with the
right combination of talent and experience, but also

•

a strong cycle in profits, pay and employment.

Implications for economic policy

That leads straight on to the first implication for policy makers. As London strengthens its
position in financial markets, the cycle in international finance will have direct effects not just
through the shifts in interest rates and asset prices but through jobs and pay in an important
sector of the London economy. Any international financial crisis will be important not just
because of its knock on effects on the core banks and markets on which British industry and
households depend but because of its direct impact on the real economy.

The growth of the City also affects the interpretation of some of the core statistics we use to
monitor and assess how the economy is developing, including those on output, earnings and,
above all, money and credit.

First our GDP numbers don’t pick up financial sector very fully. In most sectors the
contribution to GDP is roughly the sum of pay and profits. Measuring the output of the
financial sector is more difficult. In the financial sector some types of banking activity are
excluded from the final GDP figures. In 2008 the ONS plan to expand the GDP figures to
include what is called FISIM and reflects those activities of banks which they cover by their
net interest income.6 That will improve estimates of GDP, but they will continue to exclude
income that banks earn through proprietary dealing. This is probably be right as a matter of
national accounting principle but dealing in securities is a part of what some international
banks do. As a result changes in the level of activity in the City may not be fully captured in

6

'Improving the measurement of banking services in the UK National Accounts", Leonidas Akriditis, ONS Economic
and Labour Market Review, May 2007

the GDP figures which most economic models, including the Bank’s, use as their summary
statistic for the real economy.

Second the growing importance of bonuses in the financial sector can make it harder to
interpret statistics on earnings. City bonuses are generally paid at the start of the year. As
Chart 10 shows this leads to big peaks and troughs. At times when changes in earnings growth
are of great interest, as they have been in recent months, it is difficult to identify the underlying
path.

The difficulty is partly a technical issue of how to smooth out the monthly variations. Do we
spread the bonuses backwards over the last 12 months on the grounds that they are deferred
pay conditional on profits in that period (with the consequence that you don’t know the true
earnings figure for any month until over a year later)? Do you spread them forward because
they will tend to be spent over the coming year? Or do you do a bit of both? To that
uncertainty we can add the fact that there several different measures of earnings growth
including two – the AWE and AEI – which are telling a somewhat different tale.7

There is also a more conceptual challenge. Are bonuses to be treated as part of the cost of
labour or are they a form of profit sharing? The economic implications may be quite different.
In practice they are probably a bit of both; bonuses are much higher when profits are good, but
they are unlikely to disappear entirely in tough times (witness the concept of the “guaranteed
bonus”). But estimating how they divide up is not easy.

Money and credit

The third area in which the development of financial markets is complicating the interpretation
of statistics is money and credit. And again that is an area of keen attention at the moment.
The question is whether the recent growth of the money supply is telling us something about
the prospects for inflation and the economy that we are not getting from other variables – like
consumption, interest rates, prices, or inflation expectations.

7

I have used the AWE in this speech, even though it is the more recent and less well established of the two, because it
is designed to handle outliers at the top and bottom of the ranges better and the City has a disproportionate number of
outliers.

Chart 11 shows monetary growth over 130 years in the UK against consumer inflation. The
association is obvious. But even in the days of the gold standard when the Bank had a more
direct control of the money supply, money growth and inflation diverged for periods (eg in
the late 19th century and in the late 1920s). More recently, the growth of money in the 1970s
did act as a leading indication for inflation. But in the early 1980s the relationship appeared to
break down despite, or possibly because of, the fact that the monetary authorities were
explicitly targeting the monetary aggregates as a means of controlling inflation.

Part of the explanation of the divergence was that the 1980s were a period of rapid financial
innovation following the removal of exchange controls and of pricing, income and dividend
policies. This changed the amount of money people were willing to hold for a given amount of
money spending (which in economics is known as the velocity of circulation). So the increase
in money growth did not lead to a pick up in inflation.

Even so the acceleration of monetary growth at the end of the 1980s did foreshadow the upturn
of inflation at the end of the Lawson boom.

The chart shows that since 1992 the rates of growth in broad money and inflation have
diverged again and that broad money growth has picked up sharply since 2003. A key question
is whether this reflects a further spurt in financial innovation or is telling us that we should
expect increasing growth of money spending and inflation.

There are good grounds for attributing part of the increase to structural changes in the financial
markets which have led “other financial companies” (OFCs) to hold more deposits with the
banks for a given level of economic activity.8

It is within this OFCs sector that the growth in money has been the most rapid (Chart 12). The
view that much of this growth reflects structural changes of this sort is supported in my view
by the way the spread between deposit and loan rates of interest has vanished in the last few
years (Chart 13). Of course that might be the product of competition between banks to lend
8

The clearest example is the service offered by London Clearing House, where dealers effectively transact with each
other (via gilt repo transactions) across the balance sheet of LCH, which results in an increase in both OFC’s deposits
with and borrowing from banks. Similarly, in the case of a synthetic securitisation of corporate bonds, a special
purpose vehicle (SPV) is set up to issue securities to investors and holds a cash deposit at a bank from which it makes
payments if any of the securitised loans default. Both of these examples result in an increased in measured deposits at
banks, but neither presages more nominal spending.

more and attract more deposits; it also seems plausible that much of this lending is more about
balance sheet restructuring than making a profit.

However deposits associated with special purpose vehicles and intra-group only account for
part of the growth. Even if we strip out all OFC deposits the growth rate of money has still
been strong compared with the growth rate of money spending (Chart 14). In my final section I
want to discuss what we should make of this.

The significance of the money supply

In the Treasury in the 1980s I was a close observer of the attempts to find a monetary
aggregate as an intermediate target to guide policy. We were looking for both a predictable
relationship between the policy instrument, interest rates, and the measure of money and a
predictable relationship between that and our final objective, inflation. I remember the
frustrations when both links proved unreliable. I am in no doubt that we are better off
focussing directly on our final target, inflation.

However I was struck, returning eighteen months ago to the economic debate, how the place of
money in our debates had changed. Our model, like most others, is “new Keynesian”. As a
result, the discussion sometimes seems to resemble the discussions of “demand management”
in the 1970s more than the monetarist debates of the 1980s. But, if anyone was in any doubt,
monetarism was not dead but only resting. And it has recently taken wing again as persistent
monetary growth and rising asset prices have given us food for thought.

At times the discussion of money can seem detached from the rest of the policy debate. Having
listed all the other aspects of the economy factors - like world growth, consumption, financial
markets and the labour market - “money” emerges as though it was a separate determinant
impacting directly on inflation or inflation expectations like Heineken “refreshing the parts
other beers cannot reach”.9 But money is very much part of the real world and we don’t need
any hidden or ghostly mechanisms to see how it feeds through credit, asset prices and
consumption in the wider economy.

G Ryle “The Concept of Mind” London (1949) Hutchinson. Ryle was criticising as incoherent a dualist view of mind
and body in which the mind is instrumental in determining action but is wholly distinct from the physical realm.

We need to start as the Governor has said by trying to distinguish supply shocks from demand
shocks.10 Where growth in money is driven by the wish of consumers or companies to
increase their holdings of money for a given level of spending, there need be no effect on
nominal GDP or inflation. As I have discussed there is clear evidence of changes in demand of
that sort in the financial sector. But that is not the whole story. So have there been increases in
supply of money and if so how will they feed through into the economy?

What does a supply shock look like? It is easiest to visualise in a closed economy in which the
money supply is mainly notes issued by the monetary authorities. One can imagine then a
direct increase in supply – a helicopter drop of extra notes. In that world people would really
find themselves with extra cash in their pockets and would be expected to go out and spend
some or all of it. With more money chasing the same goods, we would see a direct impact, first
on money spending, then on inflation.

In the modern world the nearest equivalent to helicopter drops has been the monetary financing
of government deficits. But monetary financing is not a problem we face at the moment,
indeed it is not allowed within the EU under the Maastricht Treaty.

So what we need to be concerned about today is the creation of extra money through the
banking system and the way that happens is through the granting of credit to willing borrowers
who borrow to spend on assets, investment or consumption. The supply changes we need to
spot are changes in banks’ willingness to lend. And we don’t have to look far to find some.

Take, for example, the growth of consumer credit in the UK (Chart 15). We see rapid growth
in the late 90s and early years of this century followed by a sharp decline as banks began to see
defaults rising.

Another recent example is the sub prime market in the US. Chart 16 shows the arrears rates on
successive cohorts of loans, marking very clearly the reduction in credit quality in 2006 as the
market overshot.

10

M King “Speech to CBI Dinner, Wales”, 11 June 2007.

In both cases the figures and the market explanations confirm that these movements reflect at
least in part changes in the supply curve for credit. The borrowers were willing but the banks
were also pushing the supply by reducing costs and conditions (culminating some said in
NINJA mortgages - for those with no income, no job and no assets).

So I have no doubt that we have seen some supply changes to credit. Next we need to
distinguish the sustainable changes from the cyclical. Sustained changes either in the economy
or in financial sector technology may justify some increase in supply. For example, we have
seen a long period of low and stable inflation and unemployment and that is expected to
continue. That reduces some of the risks to lenders and borrowers and may increase both the
demand and supply of credit and the value of assets on a lasting basis. The development of
information technology allows banks to collect and analyse more information about borrowers
which should allow them to target credit better and justify a change in supply. Finally the
development of derivative markets has allowed the risks in loans to be split into their separate
components and distributed to the people best placed to bear them. Again that should lower the
supply curve for credit.

All these factors were at play in the consumer credit and the sub prime markets but, despite the
new sophistication of credit scoring and the derivatives markets, they both also showed all the
classic signs of a credit cycle. Banks competed for business by lowering the costs and
conditions on lending while the economy expanded, defaults were few, and profits appeared
high. They overdid it, defaults started to rise, losses were taken and they toughened their terms
again. The speed and severity of that cycle can have implications for financial stability as well
as the stability of the broader economy. It is for that reason that there is a wide acceptance that
there may be a case for monetary policy to “lean into the wind” in a cyclical upswing.11 That
has been one factor in my support for the four interest rate rises of the last year.

If there is evidence of a cyclical, unsustainable, element in the supply of credit and asset prices
the next questions are:
•

11

where are we in the cycle, and

Association, 1 October 2003.

•

is the present stance of monetary policy sufficient to bring it back to a
sustainable trend or, given the lags in the impact of interest rate
changes, is it set to exacerbate the downturn?

Current conjuncture

So where are we now? The consumer credit market in the UK and the sub prime and broader
housing markets in the US have turned down and, while the sub prime saga is still not played
out, it still seems unlikely that it will have severe knock on effects on the broader economy.

Elsewhere the commercial property in the UK looks to be at or close to its peak (Chart 17).The
housing market is showing some glimmers of a slowdown in activity but prices are still rising
fast, especially in London; indeed the rate of increase of house prices is higher today in nearly
every region than it was last autumn. And there is no sign of a slowdown in corporate lending.
Overall lending to PNFCs is accelerating (Chart 18), investment is high, and on a global basis
we are seeing spectacular growth in the LBO market (Chart 19) and the emergence of lower
prices and conditions with so called “covenant lite” loans.

Against that background the question is whether we have done enough. In reaching a
judgement, of course, we need to take account of the full range of information on the real and
nominal economy. We know that the full impact of past increases in rates has yet to come
through. Yet we cannot be sure how much of a restraint current rates will be at this point in
the cycle. It is not surprising therefore that there are different views on the MPC or that those
views change in response to more information.

My stance in recent months has reflected a judgement on the balance of risks taking account of
both probabilities and likely impacts. The risks we face are: first that we may increase interest
rates too fast or push them up too far, with an unnecessary loss of growth, and second that we
may raise rates too slowly with a cost in higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates
and a sharper slowdown in the end.

I voted for a further increase earlier this month partly because I was not convinced that current
rates would be sufficient to bring credit growth and nominal demand back to their long term
sustainable path. I also felt that the impact of moving too slowly on the credibility of the

regime and thus the future prospects for the economy was of greater concern, given the robust
rate of growth, than an unnecessary slowdown in activity. In reviewing the position again in
future months I will be watching the trends in the growth of credit and money carefully.
