Introduction

Regime changes are always exciting, and grist for analysis by
the

commentator.

There

been

several

such

regime changes in Central Banking during the last few years, a
most exciting period for someone like myself, not only in my
capacity as a professional observer of Central Banking but now
also as a participant.

The Chancellor’s initiatives in his

first month in office in 1997, to give the Bank of England
operational independence, and then subsequently to centralise
all financial supervision, including the supervision of banks,

There are, of course, many facets of both these institutional changes that one could discuss,
and one can also undertake compare and contrast exercises, not only for the Bank of England
and the ESCB, but also for example with the Bank of Japan, which has again recently
undergone important institutional changes, several of which are similar to those in the UK.
Indeed, there has been a veritable flood of institutional change in the last decade partly
carried along on a tide of academic enthusiasm for independent Central Banks and further
encouraged by the apparent success of such independent Central Bankers in achieving price
stability during a decade in which world growth has, I believe, recovered somewhat from
previous decades, despite Asian alarums and excursions.

Perhaps the first main mile stone on this latest voyage was to
be found in New Zealand, when the incoming Labour government

Brash its operational independence, with the Reserve Bank of

Many of the innovations subsequently adopted, such as operational independence for the
Central Bank, inflation targeting, monetary policy committees, structural reorganisations of
supervisory systems in the financial system, have become quite widely adopted in Europe,
e.g. in Sweden and Spain, in the Americas, e.g. in Canada and Chile, in South Africa and in
Asia, e.g. in Japan and perhaps now in Thailand, as well as in the Antipodes, Australia and
New Zealand. My colleagues in the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank
may, however, at this point demur and claim that the New Zealand reforms were not so much
innovations, but more amendments to their own prior practices adopted in the early 1970s.
The big exception remains the USA, but the Fed not only shared certain aspects of the new
consensus structure, such as independence, but also has achieved under its last two Chairmen,
Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, its greatest success and status. As they say there, “If it
ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.

So what I want to concentrate upon today are those aspects of
the MPC and then of the ESCB that are special, perhaps unique,
to these particular Central Banks.

It will, therefore, be a

lecture of two rather separate halves.

Moreover its transition, though so far remarkably

which to call as a guide to current actions and decisions.

By contrast, the features that particularly distinguish the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee are less dramatic.

Perhaps the most important of these is that the Inflation

Forecast is not only published, but is also the signed responsibility of the Committee
members of the MPC, including the fan charts with their estimates of variances and
uncertainties, skews and risks, though as noted in one of the Tables to the last August Report,
differences of view between MPC members can, and do, occur. In virtually all other cases of
which I am aware, the internal economic forecasts, whether published or not, are strictly
treated as the work of that Bank’s staff, not of its decision-making body, or staffs in the case
of the USA, where the Regional Feds also publish forecasts, in some cases based on rather
differing views of macro-economic inter-relationships. While such an internal staff forecast
is likely to be treated much more seriously by the decision-makers than outside forecasts, it
still leaves the latter free to disassociate themselves from such forecasts, and to reach their
decision on the basis of whatever judgment about the future, quantitative forecast-based or
intuitive, that he, or she, may prefer.

What consequences arise from this difference in operation?
Let me start with what may seem to you, but not to us in the
MPC, a minor matter, which is our own work schedule.

During the non-forecast months, we have three regular meetings
connected with the interest rate decision itself, an all-day
briefing session with the staff, and two half-day meetings for
discussion

meetings on an ad hoc basis to discuss relevant background
research or procedural issues.

With the associated reading,

and so on, the core work of the MPC requires perhaps about one
week in such a non-forecast month, or a bit more if one adds
in such other duties as visiting regional agents and other
out-reach exercises outside the Bank.

By contrast in a forecast month, there will be approximately
about another ten meetings in addition to the regular ones,
with some four, or so, to discuss starting assumptions and
issues already identified as needing discussion; some two, or
three, to consider the evolution of the forecast; and a final
couple to discuss the drafting of the Inflation Report itself.
Although the staff do the bulk of the process of running the
equations and drafting the results, nevertheless the actual
burden on the members of the MPC during such forecast months
rises by nearly a factor of three, from taking up one week in
the

month

to

approximately

three

weeks.

Given

that

the

meetings have to be scheduled to fit the crowded diaries of
the Governor and his two Deputies, during these months all
other

members

have

any

other

obligations they may have on a ‘catch-as-catch-can’ basis.
This strictly limits the kinds of other outside activities
that the so-called external members of the MPC can undertake.
I am currently the only ‘external’ member also holding down a
second outside academic job, and on the two months of the year
when MPC forecasts and term coincide, this is not comfortable.

6

Besides the question of how many meetings, and how much prior work and involvement, a
Committee should have before each decision, there is also a question of how frequently a
Committee should regularly meet to make its policy decision. The Bank of England Act
requires us to do so once a month, including August; but there was no public discussion of
the pros and cons of this choice of periodicity. One obvious advantage of a monthly meeting
is that it can be fitted into the monthly cycle of the flow of economic data; one disadvantage
is the burden on staff, who need to make full reports, even in August and during the
Christmas/New Year season. The FOMC meets eight times a year; the Governing Council of
the ESCB twice a month, but will, I believe, normally only review its interest rate decision at
its second monthly meeting. It also may be the case that the conventional minimum size of
change to official rates could be a function of the frequency of meeting, with smaller step
changes accompanying more frequent decisions. The current convention around the world
appears to be to have monthly meetings, (or slightly less frequently), with minimum step
changes of 25 b.p., unless rates are very low, e.g. below 1% or very high, in double figures,
when the step change size is equivalently lowered, or raised. But I do not know of much
published work seeking to address whether these conventions are optimal; they just seem to
have evolved without much discussion or serious consideration.

So our procedures make a considerably greater demand on Committee members’ time than is
the case, I believe, in most other countries in a roughly similar situation. What do we get in
return? Do the benefits exceed the costs in effort? Let me set out five potential benefits.
First, engaging personally in a forecasting exercise emphasizes and underlines to all involved
how restricted is our ability to peer into the future; how little we really know and how
uncertain are our estimates.

The MPC is sometimes criticized for relying too much on

forecasts; in my experience it is exactly those same critics without forecasting ability or
experience who tend to ask for simple, single-point forecasts, and place far too much weight
on them. Given then the huge range of impermeable uncertainties, how has a Committee
comprised of self-confident individuals, (one unkind journalist even once described me as

7

‘opinionated’), managed so far to agree quantitative fan projections? One partial answer is
that some members have on occasions expressed reservations which have been noted in the
text, and in the case of our last August forecast in a special Table, [6C]. Perhaps another
partial answer is that when the independent staff crank out certain numbers, that very same
uncertainty often makes it hard to justify demanding some alternative number without
sufficient analytical argumentation to sway colleagues.

Such economic arguments by

members of the MPC are, indeed, regularly made, some in the staff might think far too often,
and by the same token cause adjustments to the forecasts.

A second possible benefit of engaging MPC members personally
in the forecast is, therefore, that the resultant forecast
will itself be better.

The next potential benefit is one of greater accountability.
As

my

erstwhile

colleague,

Sir

Alan

Budd,

wrote

in

his

excellent paper for the LBS Economic Outlook earlier in July
(1999),

because

of

lags

in

the

transmission

mechanism

of

monetary policy, the MPC “is in effect targeting the expected
value of future inflation”.

If shocks, unanticipated events,

occur subsequently, then those same lags will mean that the
MPC cannot offset their effects on current inflation, or only
do so at the expense of unacceptable short term fluctuations
in interest rates, exchange rates and output.

If I may quote Sir Alan at some length:“These issues were discussed by Bean in his evidence to the Treasury Committee
(TCSC (1997)). His proposed solution to the problem was to examine forecasts made
at the time of the policy decisions. ‘To the extent that the Bank can only really affect
inflation two years or so into the future, it is in essence targeting expected inflation
two years hence. Thus in holding the Bank accountable for its interest rate decisions,
the Committee should ask whether the chosen path of interest rates is consistent with
inflation being forecast to be 2½ per cent (or whatever the target is) in two years
time.' This procedure should largely overcome the problems both of lags (provided
the forecasts have a sufficiently long horizon) and of subsequent shocks.
He proposed that the inflation projection reported in the Bank’s Quarterly Inflation
Report and the justification behind it should be the main focus of the Treasury
Committee’s scrutiny of the Bank’s decisions. This might imply that the Bank should
use forecasts of inflation as its intermediate target - i.e. that it should set interest rates
so that expected inflation is equal to the target. Apart from the problem of selecting
forecasts, discussed below, Bean agreed that it is reasonable for the Bank to have its
own views about the future path of inflation; but it should explain why they differ
from those of the market and should expect to be criticised if the market turned out to
be right.
It is possible to use published forecasts or to derive
forecast
expectations
from
the
differences
between
interest rates on index-linked and conventional gilts.
Neither is straightforward.....
Finally independent
forecasters tend to publish point forecasts [of future
inflation].
Despite [various] difficulties, the use of
contemporary forecasts remains the best way of evaluating
the MPC’s actions.

10

The Treasury Committee did not appear to be completely convinced by Professor
Bean’s conclusions but said ‘We agree that outside forecasts may well be useful as
benchmarks in probing the Bank on its inflation projections and on the interest rate
decisions it takes.’ It said it would also explore the usefulness of rules such as the
Taylor rule in providing benchmarks.
‘The Committee intends to hold the MPC accountable both ex post and ex ante. We
believe that the focus for our inquiries should not lie exclusively in using the Inflation
Report to examine the Bank's recent and planned monetary stance but that a degree of
past accountability is also called for. Once the arrangements are established, we will
be examining the inflation outturn in relation to the inflation target. If inflation
deviates substantially from the target, we will seek a comprehensive explanation from
the Bank.’”

As it happens, I personally think that the need to publish inflation forecasts in order to obtain
accountability can be overstated. Let me again take the case of the ECB. I, and most other
observers, assume that the ECB will wholeheartedly try to carry out its remit of achieving
price stability, defined as achieving an outcome of between zero, or perhaps slightly more to
take account of quality and other biasses in the statistical price indices, and 2% in the
harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP).

Should the external forecasts of future

inflation in the euro-zone, whether market-based or by independent forecasters, suggest that
this objective might not be achieved, then the European Parliament, and other commentators
may probe for reasons behind the discrepancies between such forecasts and the implicit
expectations of the ECB, whether, or not, these latter are published. It is the judgment of
markets, and of respected independent forecasters, whether, or not, the monetary authorities
have got it right that really provides the ex ante accountability, not so much the publication of
internal forecasts.

And, of course, ex post accountability is driven by events, not by

forecasts.

Finally, though I do not claim that my listing is exhaustive or complete, let me turn to the
point that the publication of the Inflation Forecast adds to transparency. This enables us to
explain, and to attempt to justify, our actions in the context of a comprehensive, quantitative
assessment of all the determinants of output and inflation. This is particularly important
because lags in the transmission mechanism, whereby monetary policy affects output and

11

then inflation, mean that our target has to be future, i.e. forecast, inflation, and not current,
today’s, inflation.

We have recently issued a short paper on the time profile of The

Transmission of Monetary Policy, which includes discussion of lags. Given such lags, the
optimal target has to be forecast, not current, inflation, as Professor Lars Svensson has
explained in a whole series of excellent academic papers. But without published forecasts of
future inflation, how could we explain coherently what we in the MPC think that we are
doing?

essential element in making us predictable.

I believe that

the publication of the Inflation Forecast does make the MPC
more transparent than other central banks that do not do so.

Let me conclude this first Section of the paper by reminding you of the five arguments for
having a published Inflation forecast which is the responsibility of the MPC itself. These are
(1) a better informed MPC, (2) a better forecast, (3) more discipline, (4) accountability and
(5) greater transparency. My own purely subjective ordinal ranking of the benefits would be,
(with 5 most and 1 least important):5

Accountability

Of course, all these putative benefits have to be weighed
against the considerable costs in time and effort that goes
into the process.

One colleague mentioned that the labour

costs of doing the forecast are tiny compared to the benefits
if the forecasts should improve the resulting policy decisions
by a tiny fraction.

No doubt this is correct, but exactly how

can one factor that thought into the administrative decisions
about budgets, staffing resources and frequency of forecasts

Political Economy.
considerations.

Here I want to discuss three more practical, policy-oriented

I should, however, first add here that whereas my comments on the

forecasting process of the MPC are obviously informed by my own membership on that
Committee, my comments on my chosen aspects of the working of the ESCB are personal,
made as an independent academic, and are in no way representative necessarily of anyone
else on the MPC or in the Bank. Anyhow, the first of my considerations concerns the role of
the ECB as a crisis manager and Lender of Last Resort. Recently (July 13, 1999), I organized
a Conference at LSE on the general subject of the Lender of Last Resort. One of the three
sessions of this was on the topic of ‘The ECB and Systemic Stability in the Eurozone’. There
were three papers, authored by three senior expert European professors, Aglietta, Bruni and
de Boissieu, and two IMF research workers, Prati and Schinasi. All three papers were
unanimously of the view that the prospective integration of the euro-zone financial system
carried with it a commensurate need for much greater centralisation of the euro-zone
supervisory system - though opinion was divided on whether that should be located within
the ECB, or kept separate - and the speedy and conscious adoption of a central LOLR role by
the ECB.

Much the same message was given by the recent CEPR monograph on The Future of
European Banking by Danthine, et al (January 1999). Let me quote directly from this, pp
98/99:“To sum up, the advent of cross-border banking, the likely emergence of panEuropean universal banks, and, more generally, the new competitive climate of
European banking, confront national supervisors with delicate coordination issues. In
the face of these challenges, we doubt that the simple coordination among
independent national authorities - as provided for by the Second Banking Directive will be a safe arrangement.
The past European experience with national supervision has not always been
satisfactory..... It is ironic that while the international financial community - precisely
.... to avoid local capture - is studying the possibility of setting up a ‘world financial
regulator’, petty national jealousies appear to be preventing this from happening at the

14

European level, thus putting the stability of European financial markets at risk.
Building a centralized supervisory body is a possibility already foreseen in the
Maastricht Treaty. Article 105(6) leaves open the possibility of a change in the
assignment of responsibilities..... Article 105(6), however, appears only to allow
centralization of supervisory responsibilities inside the ECB. While a clear
improvement of the current situation, this may not be the optimal arrangement. First,
the ECB is already being perceived as accumulating too much power, and issues of
accountability have been raised. It seems difficult therefore to envision that the ECB
might also be entrusted with regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. An
independent European-wide regulatory agency, distinct from the ECB, may generate
less concerns in this respect while at the same time facilitating accountability.
Thinking about a new European agency would also allow one
to think afresh about the desirability of combining the
supervision of banks and markets.....
[T]he likely
emergence
of
large
universal
banks
will
make
it
increasingly difficult to distinguish between market risk
and the risk of the bank. Moreover, while banks increase
their exposure to market risk, markets have become more
vulnerable to a liquidity crisis arising from the failure
of a large intermediary - the role of derivatives in this
process is central, as the cases of Barings and LTCM
demonstrate.
The argument for combining the two
functions in a supranational EU independent agency seems
overwhelming.”

But there is a problem confronting this approach that most of these authors have missed. As
I, and others, e.g. Giannini (1999) have emphasized, it has become increasingly difficult for a
Central Bank to distinguish between illiquidity and insolvency.

With a few minor

exceptions, one such being the well-known Bank of New York computer problem in 1985,
the efficient, broad, interbank, wholesale, short-term money markets are able to iron out any
liquidity problems that occasion no whiff of suspicion about insolvency.

Normally a

commercial bank will only turn to a Central Bank for LOLR services, at a higher penalty cost
in terms of both interest and reputation, if it has been effectively turned away by other banks
in the interbank wholesale money market. That implies that there must be some doubts about
solvency in such cases.

So almost any use of LOLR, in the form of lending to a particular financial institution, rather
than of generalised open market operations, by a Central Bank could involve some risk of

15

loss. It is not clear whether the ECB has the powers under its statutes to undertake such
operations, see Lastra `The Role of the ECB with regard to Financial Stability and LOLR',
(1999). Moreover, if it becomes involved in direct lending to a troubled institution(s), and
the scale of potential loss became at all significant, there would then be a question of who
might bear that loss, as well as the issue of whether any such bail-out was consistent with EC
regulations, e.g. on state aid. If the ECB became financially involved in crisis management
which might involve any sizeable funding, what sources could it approach? Its own capital is
limited, and it might face a legal claim of ultra vires if it sought to use its own capital to
support a commercial institution. The EU's budget is strictly limited, and whether a request
for subventions to finance such a bail-out would get past the European Commission, Council
and Parliament is doubtful in the extreme. Any request to the member states to divide up the
fiscal cost between them would tend to run into enormous complications. Perhaps it might
apply to its constituent national Central Banks (the NCBs) for an injection of additional
capital, but even here there might be difficulties, for example what would be the position of
those central banks whose countries were in the EU, but not in the euro-zone, i.e. the out, or
to be politically correct, the pre-in countries?

In standard cases where both the key monetary and fiscal policy institutions are centralised at
the national level, any major financial crisis, involving the potentiality for loss, will need to
be resolved by agreement and crisis management amongst the Central Bank and Ministry of
Finance.

It cannot nowadays really be done otherwise, as recent examples in Asia

demonstrate. But in the euro-zone the ECB has no fiscal counterpart. This is a strong
argument for leaving LOLR actions at the national level, subject preferably to ECB oversight
and co-ordination. This judgment is made easier currently by the fact that retail financial
activities remain nationally segmented, despite the advent of the Single Market and the Euro.
This may well change over time, but so also may the balance of fiscal competences between
the member nation states and the federal euro centre.

The second topic that I want to cover briefly concerns the relationship between monetary and

16

fiscal policies. There are those who argue that delegation of operational independence for
setting interest rates to the Central Bank adversely affects the potentiality for appropriate cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy. I do not agree. Once the political authorities
have given the objective for achieving price stability to the Central Bank, the Central Bank's
reaction function is, or should be, transparent to the fiscal authorities. Given that reaction
function, the fiscal authorities can then, in principle, choose any set of fiscal measures, and
hence consequentially interest rates, consistent with price stability. Put more simply the
fiscal authorities know that by choosing a smaller fiscal deficit, they will encourage the
Central Bank to set a lower level of interest rates in its pursuit of price stability. Claims that
Central Bank independence prevent policy co-operation are either analytically invalid or,
more likely, represent a coded attack on the primacy to be attached by nominal demand
management to the goal of price stability.

The situation is, of course, quite different in the euro-zone
where the fiscal outcome is the result of separate decisions
by eleven independent fiscal authorities, with the central EU
budget

European Council in 1997, and drawing on the previous Waigel
plan and Dublin Council meeting agreement, imposed limits on
current fiscal deficits.

In several respects these constraints are crudely designed. For example, they give no more
latitude for current fiscal flexibility to nations with very low debt ratios than to countries with
worryingly high ratios; they only make extremely restricted allowance for cyclical factors.
Be that as it may, the constraints imposed need not have adverse effects should member
countries have reached a long-run steady state equilibrium, with current deficits averaging
zero. But we are not at such an equilibrium yet. We start with many countries having
deficits quite close to the upper limit, and with the prospect of coping with an ageing
population with currently generous, but unfunded, pensions.

The prospect is then one either of continuing tight fiscal policies, whatever the cyclical
conjuncture, or of relaxations that may appear to put the Treaty agreement at some risk. The
markets and the news media appeared flustered in response to the marginal easing in the
Italian budget target, though the pattern of that seeming response, i.e. to lower the foreign
exchange value of the euro but not to shift the spread between Italian and German bonds was
hard for me to comprehend.

No matter how

small is the area of any single monetary zone, it remains,
however, unlikely that the preferred policy will be optimal
for all sectors and regions.

In the UK, for example, the

tradeable goods, largely manufacturing, sector has been under
quite severe deflationary pressure, while the non-tradeable,
mostly services sector has been buoyant.

It is, at least,

arguable that asymmetric, i.e. differential, shocks are more
likely in smaller, more open economies, especially given the
wayward and volatile nature of exchange markets.

But even if it should be the case that the problem of such differential shocks does become
somewhat worse the larger is the geographic size of the monetary union, (and the jury is still
out on this question), the extent of any such extra disadvantage is clearly small, at least under
normal circumstances.

Measures of inequality tend to be less within, than between,

countries, though this is not universally true, with political events such as the reunification of
Germany occasionally going in the opposite direction. There have been few indications that
states and provinces within vast countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India or
the USA would do better with separate monetary institutions. Wherever there are calls for
such separation, as in Quebec, Montenegro and Scotland, it is invariably driven primarily by
politics, not by economics.

Within countries with their single monetary systems, there are
