Thank you very much for inviting me here today. It is a great pleasure to be talking to the Mile End Group;
since I am fortunate enough to spend one day a week at Queen Mary, I feel firmly on home territory.
Over the last few years much has been said about the United Kingdom’s productivity puzzle; after a long
spell in which people became increasingly productive, today output per hour worked is no higher than it was
six years ago. Today I would like to look at that from an international perspective. Productivity measures
how much output one person can produce, over a specified time – such as an hour, or a year. It lies at the
heart of the long-run improvement in our standard of living. We benefit hugely, when it happens: one year’s
labour produces nearly five times as much in 2014 as it did in 1914. And we suffer, when it doesn’t: its
absence is one reason why living standards have stagnated. The outlook for productivity is an important
influence on the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) forecast of the economy, as recently published in the
November Inflation Report.

The UK is not alone in having had weak productivity growth recently. So the first issue I would like to
address is whether it has been affected more severely than other advanced economies. Secondly, I would
like to explore how far we can identify factors which influence relative productivity performance. And thirdly I
would like to offer some thoughts on the purely statistical evidence on the prospects for some sort of return
to normality as far as productivity growth is concerned.

The financial crisis caused the level of productivity to fall in many countries, with the UK more severely
affected than most. But given this initial shock, I am interested in how they have subsequently recovered.
So I will focus on economic performance after 2010, in order to see what can be said about underlying
productivity growth after the crisis.

It would be wrong to think that the economy will inevitably make up all of the lost ground from the crisis.
People often like to think in terms of trends as guides to the future; believing in trends means that there are
plenty of trends to see. An alternative view of the many series which economists study is that they are
random walks. Bygones are bygones, so the best guide to the future is often provided by rolling forward
some underlying growth rate starting from now. If this is really the case for labour productivity, the most we
should hope for is that productivity should grow on a path parallel to, but below the dotted red line on the
graph. It could be that a shock as large as the financial crisis is different, so that the productivity loss is likely
to be made up. But recent evidence does not support this, and indeed could suggest that the underlying
growth rate has also fallen.

Above this line, productivity growth is faster in the
second period than in the first, while below the line, it is
slower. You can see that only three countries appear
above the line; for the remaining twenty-four
productivity growth has been slower in the aftermath of
the crisis than it was beforehand. Although the UK’s

fall has been one of the sharper ones, it is not on its own.

had led to labour hoarding, then one might have
expected a period of relatively rapid productivity

period before the crisis capital had been
misallocated, then as time went by a period of
above-normal productivity growth would have been

expected. Profits would be relatively high in the capital scarce industries and low in the capital-surplus
industries, so the capital scarce industries would be able to afford more investment even if bank finance were
not available. And this would have a disproportionate effect on labour productivity; the increases in the
industries which were building up their capital stocks would more than offset the declines in the industries
where capital stocks were falling.

The fact that the United Kingdom is in a club with twenty-three other countries suggests that our experience
is far from unique, although it is also the case that the United Kingdom is one of the weaker performers over
the three years considered.

Separately there is something striking about the three countries above the line. Two of them, Australia and
Poland, are the two advanced economies which did not experience recessions in 2008 and 2009. The third
is Spain; some other explanation is needed to account for its membership of this select group. Bryson, Forth
and Askenazy (2014) suggest that it is a consequence of a decline in the share of output devoted to
construction, a low productivity sector, and also a decline in the use of temporary contracts.

Finally a further point emerges; productivity growth rates in period from 2010 to 2013 are at best only very
weakly correlated with those in the period before the crisis. The regression line shown on the diagram is
close to horizontal and the slope of it is not statistically significant. Pritchett and Summers (2014) suggest,
comparing GDP growth rates in one decade with those of the previous decade that there is almost no

3

correlation. They approach the issue with particular reference to growth in China and other “emerging”
economies. GDP growth rates are the sum of growth rates of hours worked and growth rates of labour
productivity appropriately compounded. Unless there were some strange inverse relationship between
growth in hours worked and growth of labour productivity, it would be strange to find a strong correlation in
productivity but none in GDP. Thus, while a question about productivity is different from a question about
GDP, it would nevertheless be strange to find strong persistence in GDP growth but none in productivity
growth.

Chart 3 compares productivity growth rates before and after the crisis. Obviously it is of interest to explore
whether and how far these differences can be explained by countries’ circumstances.

A Regression Analysis

Regression analysis provides a means of exploring the influences of circumstances and history on
productivity after the crisis. I present the results of a number of regression equations in Table 1. This
4

exercise is closely related to that of Ollivaud and Turner (2014). They try to explain the shortfall in output in
2014 as compared to what it would have been had pre-crisis growth rates continued. Here I have, in the first
three regression equations tried to explain productivity growth from 2010 to 2013 in terms only of pre-crisis
variables. The logic of this is that, if successful, such an exercise would allow us to explain today’s
circumstances without taking the recession explicitly into account.

In the first equation I include productivity growth over 2000-07, the (log) level of productivity in 2007, the
current account balance (as a proportion of GDP) and measures of financial and trade openness. The
current account balance is often seen as a predictor of banking crises while financial openness indicates the
degree of exposure to an international financial crisis and trade openness exposure to an international
down-turn. I have also included a dummy variable for Spain, given the anomalous position identified above,
together with a second dummy for countries in the euro area.

You can see that I do not have a great deal of success. Paring the explanatory variables down in columns 2
and 3, a high level of productivity before the crisis seems to depress productivity after the crisis. The Spanish
dummy is not quite significant at a five per cent level, and there is no statistically significant evidence that
membership of the euro was a handicap. A dummy for the euro area allows me to test whether continuing
problems there might be related to weaker productivity growth.

Although, in the period before the crisis, I find a stronger degree of persistence in developed countries than Pritchett and Summers
suggest for the world as a whole.

In columns 4 to 8 I try to explain productivity growth from 2010 to 2013 also taking account of recent
experience. I include two variables in addition to the earlier group. The first additional variable is the depth of
the recession, measured by the change in output from 2007 to 2009 and the second is productivity growth
during the period of recession and immediate recovery from 2007 to 2010. You can see that the clearest

indicator of productivity growth from 2010 to 2013 is the depth of the earlier recession. The euro area dummy
fades into insignificance and if I remove the level of productivity in 2007 I also find a significant role for
productivity growth in the period from 2007 to 2010. Thus the exercise suggests that the depth of the
recession and productivity performance from 2007 to 2010 are still casting a shadow over the OECD
economies, but beyond that I have not been able to identify factors explaining weak productivity growth.

This analysis could hardly be regarded as the last word. Ollivaud and Turner explored a range of variables
wider than that I have discussed here and it is possible that eventually we will be able to provide a fuller
account of the factors which have limited productivity growth since 2010. I would, however, caution against
one route. Since I have suggested that the depth of the recession is an influence on subsequent productivity
growth you might think that if I can explain the depth of the recession, that would offer a route to
understanding the underlying causes behind weak productivity growth. The trouble with this avenue is that,
while I can find factors which explain the depth of the recession, they do not do so with sufficient precision to
make this approach possible, at least with the data with which I have been working.

5

The results so far suggest that, weak productivity growth is one of the consequences of the recession. There
is no doubt that the recession was, in turn, a consequence of the financial crisis which began in the summer
of 2007. What do studies of the links between financial crises and the economy as a whole tell us?

Oulton and Sebastiá-Barriel (2013) show that banking crises tend to have a permanent effect on levels of
productivity and GDP, although their work assumes that they have only a temporary effect on the growth
rates. In developed countries they find that a crisis depresses the growth rate on average by 0.5 (-0.1 to 1.1)
6

per cent, but that the long-run effect is to raise the level of output by 0.4 (-0.2 to 0.9) per cent for each year
the crisis lasts as the dynamics play out. In developing countries growth rate is depressed by 0.8 (0.2 to 1.4)
per cent and there is a permanent impact on output of 1.2 (0.2 to 2.2) per cent. In the OECD economies, if I
7

look only at those which counted as advanced in 1971 productivity growth has fallen by just over 1 per cent
since the start of the crisis. This is compatible with what Oulton and Sebastiá-Barriel find for developing
countries only provided one assumes that the crisis has continued from 2008 to 2013. Thus, even if one
assumes that differences between developed and developing countries found in their work arise because of
the differing intensity of the crises over the period since 1950, recent experience can be explained only if one
assumes that the crisis has, for practical purposes continued unabated for six years. Alternatively the crisis
has had a durable effect on productivity growth, which for me feels more plausible.

Nevertheless the mechanism remains very unclear. Riley, Rosazza-Bondibene and Young (2014) find that
the crisis affected the supply of credit to businesses. But they do not find the sort of heterogeneity between

different types of businesses which would have been expected if there were a direct link between credit
supply and productivity.

The Role of Investment

Up to now, I have focussed on how much output can be supplied by an hour of labour input. But of course
labour needs capital to produce anything, so you might also wonder about the role of investment. Although
there are good reasons for expecting investment to influence productivity growth, it is also likely to be the
case that investment depends on growth. Pessoa and van Reenen (2014) assume a relatively high
depreciation rate of capital, and argue that capital per worker fell by 9% over the crisis. If true, this would
explain a substantial part of the fall in both real wages and labour productivity. But the data for the
United Kingdom published in 2011 and 2012 suggested that net investment had remained positive, so,
unless there was very considerable scrapping, it seems likely that the capital stock continued to rise.
Oulton (2013) estimates that this was the case, although the capital stock grew less rapidly than before the
crisis.

Some care is needed in exploring the relationship between investment and growth of labour productivity.
National accounts were designed in 1940 as a tool for war-time management and in those circumstances it
made sense to focus on gross capital formation and gross domestic product. If we want to know whether the
capital stock is growing or not, however, we need to focus on capital formation net of depreciation. This
makes a material difference. The OECD national accounts show net disinvestment between 2010 and 2013
in a number of countries including Greece, Italy and Japan, but not the United Kingdom. Secondly, if hours
worked are growing rapidly then substantial capital investment is needed merely for the amount of capital to
8

grow in line with labour; some adjustment is needed to take account of that . I work with growth in labour
productivity adjusted for this capital dilution effect and compare this with the share of net capital formation in
GDP.

8

Growth accounting (Solow, 1957) suggests that the growth in GDP (Y/Y) should be accounted for by the sum of the growth in hours
worked (L/L) multiplied by the share of employment income in domestic income,  and the growth in the capital stock (K/K) multiplied
by the share of gross operating surplus in domestic income, 1- together with a residual. Making the simplifying assumption that
indirect taxes fall similarly on capital and on output, the share of gross surplus is equal to the gross rate of return, r+multiplied by the

Data are not available for Ireland or New Zealand and I also leave Greece out of the analysis because it is a
clear outlier. Looking at the remaining twenty-four countries, there is a significant correlation between the
change in capital formation and the change in adjusted labour productivity, in both cases comparing growth
between 2010 and 2013 with growth from 2000 to 2007. The regression coefficient is 0.15 (0.02 to 0.28); I
am hesitant to put much weight on this because, as I mentioned, there is a question whether investment is a
response to, as well as a driver of productivity growth. Nevertheless such a figure is not much above what
might be expected for a reasonable rate of return gross of depreciation. Net capital formation in the
United Kingdom as a share of GDP was 1.6 percentage points lower after 2010 than it had been before the
crisis. Using the coefficient of 0.15 which, as I have suggested, is probably on the high side, this points to
only a small part of the UK’s decline (0.23/2.2) in labour productivity being accounted for by weaker capital
formation.

An alternative way of looking at the story is to study residual productivity growth, usually called total factor
productivity growth, that is the component of productivity growth which is not accounted for by capital
formation. The European Commission provides estimates of this and the picture they give is broadly
consistent with that shown for labour productivity; growth rates of total factor productivity are faster from
2010 than in 2001-2007 for only three countries, Australia, New Zealand and Spain, while there is no
obvious relationship between total factor productivity growth rates in the two periods. Thus we can safely
conclude that, while reduced investment may play a role, it is probably not the dominant factor behind slower
labour productivity growth.

Secular Stagnation and Productivity Growth

The failure of the major economies, and in particular those on the continent, to recover the spring they had
before the crisis has led to concerns that the world is now facing a long period of economic stagnation. There
has recently been a lively international discussion on the prospects for productivity growth. Gordon (2014)
focuses on the United States. He points out that, with the exception of the “new economy” period from 1996
to 2014 underlying (total factor) productivity growth after allowing for the effects of rising educational
attainment in the United States has been appreciably weaker since 1972 than it was in the previous eighty
years; the overall productivity growth rate has, however, been sustained by improving educational attainment
of the labour force. He argues that educational attainment is now stagnating. In the absence of some other
new source of growth, overall productivity growth is therefore likely to stagnate. Even if one argues that new
economy episodes are likely to occur with the same frequency as over the last forty years, the conclusions
are not greatly affected.

As Crafts (2014) points out, concerns about stagnation were also widespread in the 1930s, despite the fact
that the Great Depression did not lead to the general loss of productivity and productivity growth which has
followed from our more recent crisis.

9

Weak productivity growth, if it persists is bound to be associated with slow overall economic growth and is
10

one of the factors behind fears about secular stagnation . Crafts argues that in many countries supply-side
reforms can improve productivity performance and thus facilitate renewed economic growth.

How far can one hope that policy changes will remedy the productivity problem? Barnes, Bouis,
Briard Dougherty and Eris (2013) bring together the results of a number of studies that the OECD has carried
out to try and understand the possible impact of economic reforms. They set out their analysis in terms of
GDP per head rather than per hour worked. The relative patterns of the two differ, first because different
countries have different proportions of the population which work and secondly because working years are of
very different duration in different countries. Labour market policies are likely to have an important impact on
these two factors but relatively little impact on labour productivity. However, their analysis also includes
things which are likely to influence productivity, e.g. product market regulation, openness, R & D incentives
and educational attainment and quality. Tax structures can affect both labour supply and capital intensity.
These two influences are, however, combined in the OECD study.

The data are more patchy, but it is noteworthy that, while Germany and the United States experienced similar economic contractions
between 1928 and 1932, productivity was unchanged in the former and fell sharply in the latter. In the United Kingdom, which,
compared to Germany and the United States, was almost a bystander of the Great Depression, productivity rose between 1928 and
1932 (Solomou and Weale, 2010).

A separate concern is that, perhaps as a result of both slow productivity growth and reduced growth in populations of working age,
investment demand in advanced economies is likely to be weaker than in the past. Without a rise in consumption demand to offset this,
the advanced economies risk a sustained period of demand deficiency. Proponents of this view of secular stagnation point out that it
may not be possible to reduce interest rates low enough to offset this.

puzzle is an OECD and not a UK issue. Are there
nevertheless grounds for thinking that productivity in
the UK can be driven by an element of catch-up, not
with an extrapolation of the position before 2008 but
with the actual level of productivity in the United

States? The suggestion that catch-up enhances productivity growth was explored, for example, by Marris
(1982) and, in the 1990s underpinned a voluminous literature on economic growth. Perhaps the most recent
Figure 1

issue raised by this more recent literature was whether productivity would converge with that of the United
States or perhaps to a level lower than that of technically most advanced country (see Islam (1995) and Lee,
Pesaran and Smith (1997)). Chart 5 shows the productivity levels of the G7 economies measured relative to
the United States. The profile is not exactly the same as that for output per hour in Chart 2 both because
productivity is measured relative to the United States and also because output is valued at international
prices, not national market prices, in order to facilitate the cross-country comparison.

Five of the six present a picture of convergence followed by stasis or modest decline, while Canada shows a
stable or weakening position for the forty years considered. A graph cannot predict the future. It is perfectly
possible that the catch-up process will resume tomorrow. Nevertheless, it should caution us against
assuming that the UK is better at catching up with the United States than are the other large economies. In
particular it is noteworthy that the United Kingdom’s peak level of productivity relative to the United States
was reached in 2001 rather than immediately ahead of the crisis.
On the other hand, there are also grounds for optimism about the United Kingdom’s position relative to the
United States, if not its absolute rate of productivity growth. Improving educational attainment is generally
thought to be a factor behind rising labour productivity. Well-educated people are paid more than poorly
educated people and, if relative pay measures their productivity, the latter should be higher. Over the last
twenty years the educational attainment of young people has risen very sharply. During the thirty or forty
years after the Second World War the United States had a clear lead in rising educational attainment but,
that is no longer the case. Chart 6 shows the educational attainment of i) the whole population aged
11

It is possible that the slope of this line of best fit is dampened by errors in the measurement of the different factors. But only an
implausibly large degree of measurement uncertainty would be able to explain the results presented here.

Financial Markets Views of Economic Growth

No one would want to assume that financial markets possess a clairvoyance denied to the rest of us.
Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that movements in financial markets during the course of the year are
consistent with investors downgrading their views of the prospects for economic growth, perhaps because
they think the productivity growth rate since 2010 is the new normal. A conventional way of examining
movements in equity markets is through the lens of the dividend discount model, as described in Inkinen,
Stringa and Voutsinou (2010). This is an accounting framework which uses as inputs expected future cash
flows, the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium. These variables are however unobservable, so various
assumptions and proxy measures are used instead. As a result, any conclusion drawn from the output of the
model depends crucially on the plausibility of these assumptions and proxies, which could change over time.

One assumption made is that the expected long-term growth rate of money dividends is constant at five per
12

cent per annum.

Along with the other assumptions, described in detail by Inkinen, Stringa and Voutsinou

(2010), the model then provides an implied level of the equity risk premium at each point in time. Recently
we have seen falling long-term interest rates but no comparable uplift in share prices (see Broadbent, 2014
for a wider discussion of this). The explanation usually drawn from the dividend discount model is that the
risk premium associated with shares has increased; people have become more risk averse. An alternative
explanation is, however, that the expected long-term rate of growth of dividends has fallen. This is consistent
with inflation being on target but a fall in the expected long-term growth rate of real GDP such as might arise
if the sort of movement in labour productivity compared to before the crisis were expected to be permanent.

12

In reality, the annual growth rate of dividends may be less than 5%. Although it is reasonable to assume that money GDP will grow at
this rate, dividends per share should be expected to grow less rapidly because an increase in the share issue is likely to be needed to
finance an expanding capital stock. This is the historical experience. Nevertheless this does not greatly affect my point here.

In both 2006 and 2010 the implied average risk premium consistent with five per cent growth in dividends per
Chart 7: Quarterly Productivity Growth (per
cent per quarter)

share was 4.85 per cent and that was also true at
the start of this year. Setting the risk premium at this
level and instead calculating the implied long-run
growth rate from the accounting identity, I find that
the expected money rate of growth of dividends per
share has dropped by around one percentage point
since the start of the year. Such a decline would be
expected to result from a decline in expected labour
productivity growth of similar magnitude. The
adjustment in share prices and long-term interest
rates during the course of this year could be seen as
recognition by investors of weak productivity growth
and an assumption that this will prove more or less
permanent. I now turn to the question of whether

Source: ONS and own calculations

this is likely to be the case or not.

The First Sign of a Thaw? The outlook for UK productivity growth

Recent data from the Office for National Statistics suggest that productivity growth in the third quarter of this
year was around 0.6 per cent. This is the first time for over three years that productivity growth has been
faster than the average of 2000-2007. After the disappointments of the last few years one would be bold
indeed to be confident that this is the start of a sustained revival. I have not been able to identify factors
responsible for the weak productivity growth, except in the broad sense that it is related to the financial crisis
and the experience of countries during the period 2008-2010, so I cannot be confident that shadow of this is
now easing. But in real life time is a great healer and perhaps we can hope that is true even for Britain’s
productivity growth.

In the period before the crisis, the statistical evidence supports the idea that there is a clear underlying rate
of productivity growth; slow growth in one year does not imply a sustained period of slow growth. So the
question is whether the underlying rate of growth has declined or not. It is a general feature of noisy
time-series data that changes of this type cannot be identified with any degree of precision; even if one
concludes that the underlying pattern has changed, that does not in any case mean that the change is
permanent. One means of identifying an underlying growth rate is provided by Harvey (2013). An attraction
of this method is that it deals coherently with fact that there are, from time to time, very large movements in
productivity. These are more common than would be expected if productivity growth rates could be
represented by the Gaussian bell-curve distribution.

overstate swings in underlying growth. Chart 8
suggests that the third quarter of this year is no
more than a brief ray of sunshine in the gloom.

If my earlier discussion has highlighted the past and
current weakness in UK productivity, what does the
future hold? I have pointed out that the sense of the
near-term outlook for productivity is that we can
hope for a modest recovery, although not yet back
to the growth rates enjoyed before the crisis.

productivity pickup as projected in the November

Looking further ahead at the prospects for
productivity growth over the medium term, I can
explore the UK data in a little more detail.

Given the estimate of underlying UK productivity
growth in Chart 8, I can explore whether the decline
in productivity dates from the onset of the financial
crisis, or whether there were signs of its arrival
before then, as suggested for the US by Gordon
(2014). Using statistical tests to identify a fall in the
underlying trend, I find no evidence that the decline

Another method is to use statistical tools to distinguish between three different states of the world – one in
which the UK enjoyed strong productivity growth; one with weak growth, and another of sharp slowdown.
We can then infer from the model which state we are more likely to be in currently, and this provides us with
an insight into the likely future behaviour of the economy.

Chart 10: Distinguishing between normal

The result of this exercise is shown in Chart 10, with the

and stagnant productivity growth

‘strong growth’ regime in yellow, ‘weak growth’ in green
and ‘sharp slowdown’ in blue. Each line represents the
probability of the economy being in one state at any point
in time, and the probabilities always sum to one. I have
shaded the past three recessions to illustrate how
differently productivity has behaved in each one. Since
the run up to the financial crisis, the economy seems to
have been stuck in a regime of weak growth, interrupted
only by the sharp slowdown during the crisis itself. The
model points to a path for productivity over the next three
years very similar to that forecast by the MPC, even
though it assumes that the long-run growth potential of the

economy is no different from what it was before the crisis.
This is based on the assumption that the probability of a
shift from weak growth to strong growth is no different
from what it was before the crisis.

Conclusions

Perhaps the main conclusion to be drawn from this is that, to the extent we are interested in growth since
2010 we should talk about an international productivity puzzle rather than a UK productivity puzzle. Labour
productivity growth rates are generally lower than they were in the years before the crisis and, as Gilhooly,
Weale and Wieladek (2012) suggest, this is perhaps a consequence of international rather than domestic
factors. Both the depth of the recession from 2007 and productivity growth during the recession and
immediate recovery explain some part of the productivity weakness and in that sense the financial crisis is
casting a long shadow. Equally attempts to explain productivity differences in terms of market structures and
other indicators of the economic environment in different countries do not seem to be markedly successful.

There is no clear evidence that productivity growth in euro area countries was particularly badly affected after
taking into account experience during the recession and immediate recovery. Underlying productivity growth
in the United Kingdom declined in the aftermath of the recession after many years when it had not fluctuated
a great deal. On the other hand the most recent data do suggest some improvement. An analysis which

separates the economy into periods of falling productivity, weak productivity growth and strong productivity
growth suggests that productivity growth should be expected to pick up largely in line with the MPC’s
forecast. This is, however, based on the assumption that the extended period of weak growth we have seen
since the recession does not, itself imply that weak growth has become more likely. If that is the case, then
the MPCs forecast has to be seen as optimistic.

In the February Inflation Report (page 47) the Monetary Policy Committee explored the implications of
weaker productivity growth; it resulted in higher inflation within about a year. Persistently slower productivity
growth would have two implications for interest rates; in the short term, interest rates would need to be
higher in order to prevent demand running ahead of supply. But over the medium term, interest rates may
remain lower than they were before the crisis, reflecting weaker underlying growth.

The MPC does not have the luxury of being able to wait for the fog of uncertainty over productivity growth to
clear up. Exploration of recent trends provides some help, but understanding what they imply for the future
remains essentially a matter of individual judgement. It may well be sensible for the MPC to take an
optimistic stance, partly on the grounds that brisk demand growth will pull productivity up by its own
boostraps, but the evidence for this is at best tenuous. Only hindsight will help us judge how performance
was affected by the financial crisis.
