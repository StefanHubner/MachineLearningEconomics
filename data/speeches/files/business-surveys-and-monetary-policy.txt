Good evening! It is a great pleasure to be asked to say a few words to mark the 50th birthday of the
CBI’s Industrial Trends survey. The birthday boy and I have, in fact, been acquainted with each
other for over thirty years – from when I started my professional career in 1975 as a forecaster in
the Treasury. In those days, the quarterly Industrial Trends survey was really the only game in
town as far as business surveys go. Since then, the field has become more crowded, but the
Industrial Trends survey remains a key source of information about business developments.

To celebrate the survey’s birthday, I thought that I might say a few words tonight about the part
played by business surveys, and intelligence about business conditions more generally, in our
setting of Bank Rate each month. Because our interest rate decisions affect UK economic activity
and inflation with a rather long, and sometimes rather variable, lag, there is nothing much that we
can do to affect the current and near-term rate of inflation. That is already largely baked into the
cake. Instead we have to focus on inflation prospects in the medium term – that is, two years or so
ahead. So we therefore need to form a judgement on where the economy is likely to be heading.
But to do that, we need to start by figuring out where we are now.

The great Danish physicist Niels Bohr is supposed to have observed that “Prediction is very
difficult, especially about the future.” But I don’t think he realised just how tough economic
forecasting is. Not only is the MPC unsure of the prospects for commodity prices, how the credit
crunch will play out and a myriad of other future events, but we don’t even have a precise picture of
the current state of the economy. As a result, controlling the economy has been likened to driving
along a winding road looking only in the rear-view mirror. Indeed, it’s worse than that as we don’t
even have that good a view of where it has been in the past either! It is as if the rear window is also
a bit misted up.

Our primary signposts are, of course, the official data provided by the Office for National Statistics
for the key macroeconomic variables, such as output, spending, employment, prices, wages and so
on. However, we do not rely on the official data exclusively, for a number of reasons. First, it
takes time for the official data to be collated and published. For instance, the preliminary estimate
of GDP growth in Q2 only appears tomorrow, almost a month after the quarter ended.

Second, early official estimates are often based on incomplete samples, with missing information
extrapolated from other indicators. As more information accrues over time, so the data gradually

3
then get revised. And significant revisions can still occur for some years after the event. For an
example, look at Chart 1. This plots the initial and current official estimates of four-quarter UK
GDP growth, as well as the range of the intervening estimates. As you can see, the picture provided
by the mature data sometimes looks quite different to that furnished by the first estimates. For
instance, the initial estimates suggested a sharp slowdown in 1998 in the wake of the Asia and
Long-Term Capital Management crises, whereas the current estimates suggest that the pace of
expansion barely eased. For more recent quarters, the initial and current estimates are closer
together, but that may simply reflect the comparative youth of the latest estimates, as well as the
fact that the 2007 Blue Book did not involve a full balancing of the National Accounts.

Finally, even mature data that has gone through the full revision process may still not give a fully
accurate picture because of the intrinsic difficulty of measuring a particular economic concept, for
instance the value added by the financial sector. In such cases, the ONS are instead forced to
employ proxies, but sometimes these are just not all that good a guide.

The need to form as up-to-date and reliable a picture of the current state of the economy as possible
means that the MPC makes extensive use of business surveys alongside the official data. That
includes not only the quarterly Industrial Trends survey and its monthly sibling, but also the other,
more recent, CBI surveys, such as those covering the distributive trades and service sectors. The
various surveys carried out by other organisations, such as the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
Supply and the British Chambers of Commerce, are also valuable sources of information for us.
Moreover, we have our own network of 12 regional agencies, whose role is to collect intelligence as
to what is happening on the ground. Collectively, our regional Agents have about 8000 business
contacts and they represent an important additional source of timely information for us.

The uses of the survey data are varied. First, different indicators more often than not seem to tell
different stories and we need to figure out which is the right one. For instance, at the current
juncture, there is a marked discrepancy between the official data on the volume of retail spending,
which points to considerable robustness this year – including whopping growth of 3.6% in May
alone, though that was fully reversed in today’s release for June – and the Distributive Trades
survey, which suggests significant weakness (see Chart 2). While the ONS have suggested that the
official data are likely to be better at picking up small retailers and unconventional shopping
channels, such as internet purchases, the conformity of the picture given by the Distributive Trades

4
survey with other potential indicators of spending, such as consumer confidence and the Agents
reports, have led us to place less weight on the official data on retail spending for the present.

The surveys will not always provide the best coincident guide, however. For instance, during the
1999-2002 period, the official data suggested greater swings in manufacturing output growth than
did the Industrial Trends survey (see Chart 3). Now, during this period, we know that there was a
rapid expansion in ICT-related activities, followed by a sharp contraction. The simple balance of
“ups” over “downs” in the Industrial Trends survey could therefore be expected to have failed to
reflect adequately the sharp movements in that sub-sector’s activity. So, for this period, the official
data probably gave a better picture of what was going on.

A second use of surveys is in the application of forward-looking questions to form a view of the
near-term outlook. In that regard, questions on business and consumer confidence, and on the trend
in orders and backlogs, can give some indication of likely trends in output and spending. The
surveys are also useful in forming an assessment of the prospects for capital spending, as this is an
area where statistical models are particularly poor – and I should know, having spent some of my
formative years at the Treasury unsuccessfully trying to build econometric models to predict
investment! Both the CBI and BCC surveys collect information on investment intentions, and it is
also something we ask our Agents to take a view on, based on their contact interviews (see Chart 4).
We look closely at this information when assessing the outlook for business investment.

Other forward-looking questions can also prove valuable. For instance, at the current juncture, with
CPI inflation well above our 2% target, we need to judge how much further it will rise and for how
long that might persist. Past experience gives us some guide as to the speed at which higher
commodity prices pass down the supply chain and the extent to which those movements are
amplified or attenuated by movements in other costs and prices. But the questions on pricing
intentions contained in the business surveys represent a valuable additional source of information
on near-term inflation pressures.

A third use of surveys is in helping the MPC diagnose the causes of recent developments. Here, the
quarterly Industrial Trends survey stands out as particularly useful because it has a rich set of
questions that explore companies concerns. For example, it has questions about the factors limiting
investment, exports, and output. Responses to those sorts of questions can, for instance, help us

5
work out how businesses have been affected by the recent depreciation of sterling, and the
tightening in credit conditions.

A fourth use of the surveys is in providing measures of variables for which there is no official
counterpart. In particular, the amount of economic slack in the economy is a key determinant of
inflationary pressures. We have official indicators of slack in the labour market – unemployment,
vacancies and the like – which is one factor determining pay growth. But we have no official
measures of the amount of slack within businesses, which potentially affects pricing pressures.
Business surveys such as the Industrial Trends survey do, however, ask how intensively firms are
working their capital (see Chart 5). And the MPC draws on this information in forming a
judgement about the overall margin of spare resources in the economy.

A fifth, and perhaps less obvious, use of survey information is in refining our picture of the past. I
noted earlier that the official data tends to get revised for some while after it is first released. But it
turns out that there are some systematic patterns in the historical revision process. Moreover, for
some series, we have found a tendency for revisions to be in the direction of reducing the
discrepancy with the corresponding survey information. So rather than just taking the latest vintage
of official data at face value, we can employ statistical techniques to exploit this information in
order to refine our assessment of the past.

An example of this approach, drawn from our May Inflation Report, is shown in Chart 6. This
shows our assessment of the range of possible final outturns for four-quarter GDP growth rates for
the past six years. The current vintage of official GDP growth data is shown by the green line. The
centre of the darkest purple band of the fan reflects our view of the most likely path once the
revisions process is complete – a “backcast”, if you like. The fan around this path indicates the
uncertainty around this projection, with a 9 in 10 chance of the eventual outturn lying somewhere
inside it. The width of this fan is based on the historical experience of data revisions. The fan
becomes progressively narrower the further back in time one goes, reflecting the reduced incidence
of revisions for more distant periods. For the recent past, the most likely path for the mature
estimates of growth lies above the current vintage of data, reflecting our judgement that the business
surveys and the past history of revisions together make it somewhat more likely that the official
estimates for this period will in future be revised up, rather than down.

6
I hope that this gives you a sense of the use we make of business surveys, and business intelligence
more generally, in making our regular assessment of the state of the economy each month, before
taking our decision on the appropriate level of Bank Rate. The timeliness of this information is
particularly important at the current juncture, when the economic climate is changing rapidly. The
global and UK economies have been subject to two large shocks of uncertain magnitude, duration
and impact. The first is the continuing de-leveraging in the banking system and the attendant
squeeze on the terms and availability of credit. The second is the fairly relentless rise in commodity
prices, especially that of oil, driven in part by the robust growth in demand in the emerging
economies. These two shocks both depress output growth, though they have divergent effects on
inflation.

In our May Inflation Report, our central expectation was for four-quarter GDP growth to slow
markedly through this year, reflecting both subdued real income growth and tighter credit supply
(see Chart 7, which also includes the same backcast information as Chart 6). It was then expected
to gradually recover through 2009 as credit conditions slowly improved. The corresponding
projection for CPI inflation is shown in Chart 8 (note that no uncertainty is shown for the past, as
the data for CPI inflation are rarely revised). Our central projection was for inflation to continue to
rise during the second half of this year to a peak close to 4% and then – assuming that oil prices
stabilised – to fall back towards the 2% target as the growing margin of spare capacity in the
economy held back pay and price increases. Since May, inflation has turned out higher than
expected and oil prices have risen further, notwithstanding some moderation in the past week or so.
But the news on activity has not been very good either, with some distinctly downbeat business
surveys, including yesterday’s Industrial Trends survey, further weakening in the housing market
and continued fragility in the financial sector. All this points to a worse near-term prospect for both
growth and inflation. The net impact of this on the outlook for inflation in the medium term is less
clear, though for our considered view on that, you will have to wait until our August Inflation
Report is published in a couple of weeks time.

Moreover, there are considerable risks surrounding the central outlook. A particular risk on the
upside is that the extended period of elevated inflation leads to an acceleration in pay and causes
inflation expectations to rise. That could lead the higher inflation to become embedded. But on the
downside, there is a risk that the credit crunch leads to a deeper and more prolonged slowdown,
leading to greater slack in the economy and causing inflation to undershoot our target.

7
In setting policy, we have been trying to balance off these risks against each other. In making that
judgement, the more accurate a picture we have of the economy, the better. So the Industrial
Trends survey, as well as the other business surveys, will continue to be a crucial input into forming
that picture. Let me therefore conclude by wishing Many Happy Returns to the Industrial Trends
survey on the occasion of its 50th birthday. We hope that you and your younger siblings will
continue to flourish in the years ahead. Thank you!
