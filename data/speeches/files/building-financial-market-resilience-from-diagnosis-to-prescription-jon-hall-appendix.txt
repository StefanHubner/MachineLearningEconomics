weighted by multiplying the net position in dollars by the number of years to the
centre of each reported maturity class, to roughly reflect the sensitivity of market
values to changes in yields.

Chart 3: Estimated initial
margin payments for UK
NBFIs

Sources: Supervisory returns and Bank calculations.
Notes: Supervisory data on initial margins demands on NBFI clients of
clearing members at UK CCPs act as a proxy for the initial margin paid by
NBFIs. The estimates likely provide a lower bound for IM demands, as the
data do not include IM requirements for uncleared derivatives as well as
cleared trades at non-UK CCPs.

and estimated NBFI variation
margin demands

Sources: Crane Data LLC, EMIR Trade Repository Data, and Bank calculations.
Notes: Variation margin calls are estimated using the EMIR Trade Repository Data
on interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, inflation swaps, and crosscurrency basis swaps. The estimates are based on the methodology used in
Bardoscia et al. (2019), ‘Simulating liquidity stress in the derivatives market’.

Proposals

Proposals
• Increase transparency and reduce pro-cyclicality in margin calculations. Ensure all derivatives users
enhance planning for, and management of, liquidity outflows.
• Reform money market funds so that they are either regulated and managed in a way that allows them to
perform their function in times of stress, or are no longer considered cash-like investments
• Ensure that open-ended investment funds align their redemption terms with the liquidity of their
assets. They can do this by holding more liquid assets, by lengthening redemption periods, or through
more effective use of swing pricing.
• Make it a principle to always analyse market structure changes in the context of their impacts on
liquidity in bad times as well as good.
• Consider tools to reduce both jump-to-illiquidity risk, and the risk that excessive leverage by non-bank
financial institutions causes market dysfunction in stress.
• Examine central bank tools, including exploring offering central bank government bond repo, with very
high haircuts, to a broad array of counterparties that meet appropriate standards.
