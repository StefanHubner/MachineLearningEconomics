1. Introduction
1

Central banks sit at the heart of the monetary economy providing the ultimate

settlement asset and typically operating the large-value payment systems that underpin
financial activity. The modern central bank’s twin objectives of monetary and financial
stability emerged from their early role in settling claims between banks.
2

But this traditional payments function is subject to the same forces for change

that are transforming the rest of the economy. In particular, developments in
technology, the financial innovation they allow, and the globalisation of finance are
reshaping the landscape, exposing new sources of risk and posing fresh challenges for
regulators and central banks.
3

As markets become more interconnected and international, national authorities

have to work more closely together, cooperating in their oversight and operational
activities and coordinating their risk assessments. As new products and players emerge
in the commercial sector, they may also need to adapt the scope of their oversight and
regulatory response.
4

I would like to take some time this afternoon to explore some of these issues,

many of which will resurface over the course of this two-day conference.
2. Early demands: the historical context
5

First some history. How did central banks come to assume their ‘central’ role in

the financial infrastructure?
6

Internationally, Venice claims a key role in the story, but I will start later with

the activities of goldsmiths in 17th century London.

Starting from their custody

business, goldsmiths began to settle transactions between merchants, across their books
or via the transfer of deposit receipts – the early bank notes. Merchants were thereby

1

able to settle obligations with one another without having to carry, count out and value
coins: a welcome development, considering that a £100 sterling bag of silver coins – a
commonly used value for notes – weighed over 30 pounds (14kg for those in the
audience baffled by imperial measures)!
7

Over time, so as to accommodate transfers between customers of different

‘banks’, the banks started accepting claims on each other and, once they found ways to
settle these claims, established the first British interbank payment systems.
8

So what were these early settlement mechanisms? At first, banks started settling

interbank claims using gold and silver coins. But these were in short supply and, again,
costly to transport and exchange.
9

Banks thus eventually innovated by switching to settlement in assets convertible

into gold and silver. For example, by the 1770s, London bankers had begun to settle in
notes issued by the Bank of England, a highly-regarded, but at that time, private bank.
10

A low-risk settlement asset was particularly important in the unregulated world

of the goldsmiths, in which credit risk was acute and liquidity shocks – like the one we
have experienced of late − were common and dangerous. In a sorry letter to an
associate1, one goldsmith wrote to another in the 1660s: “I have beene by many
accidents much postpon’d…ye money due to mee is soe farre off that I can not make it
useful to mee. All Credit in London is much Shortened of late.”
11

Showing all the optimism which continues to characterise bankers today, he

added: “ I am attempting a way to enlarge my owne ( credit) and doubt not to effect it
to his Maties.[Majesties] advantage as well as my owne, if I am ( like ye lame dogg) but
helpt over this style.”

1

Quoted in Quinn (1997), “Goldsmith-Banking: Mutual Acceptance and Interbanker Clearing in
Restoration London”, Explorations in Economic History 34, pp411-432

2

12

Further efficiency gains were then obtained by settling interbank obligations

over the accounts of a single institution. This innovation was sometimes put in place by
the public authorities; in other cases it developed naturally, such as when the London
bankers adopted Bank of England deposits as the ultimate settlement asset in 1854.
3. Payments and monetary and financial stability
13

To ensure that its liabilities continue to be perceived of higher quality than those

of any other issuer, the institution at the apex of the payment system – typically the
central bank – has an incentive to exercise close control over the terms on which they
are made available to the banking system.
14

That translates into the traditional monetary stability objective: preservation of

the role of the ultimate settlement asset as a store of value and unit of account. It also
gives the central bank a strong interest in the stability of the financial system. And
within that a reliable and resilient infrastructure for distributing the ultimate settlement
asset is a key condition of stability (and of implementing monetary policy effectively).
15

In an advanced monetary economy, of course, bank deposits constitute by far the

largest component of ‘money’; in the UK they make up some 96% of the broad
monetary aggregate, M4. Agents rely on interbank payment systems to facilitate the
direct transfer of deposits between banks and thereby also preserve their role as a
medium of exchange. And as the sophistication of securities and other markets has
grown, the core payment systems have become intertwined with the settlement and
clearing systems for the key markets. Together they have become a critical part of the
infrastructure not just for the financial system but for the economy more widely. And in
the wake of 9/11, all central banks have been giving more attention to the physical and
financial resilience of these systems. For example, in our regular Financial Stability

3

Report, the Bank of England has included the risk of infrastructure disruption in the list
of the top six vulnerabilities facing the financial system over the last two years.
16

As Alan Greenspan notes in his memoirs: “We’d always thought that if you

wanted to cripple the US economy, you’d take out the payment systems. Banks would
be forced to fall back on inefficient physical transfers of money. Businesses would
resort to barter and IOUs; the level of economic activity across the country could drop
like a rock.”
17

In a paper to be presented at this conference tomorrow, Andrea Gerali and

Franco Passacantando consider this in the context of the Great Depression.

As

confidence in the banking system evaporated, bank deposits ceased to function as a
medium of exchange. ‘Scrip’, or substitute money, emerged, typically taking the form
of vouchers or coupon books. Such monies had otherwise only been commonly used in
isolated lumber or coal-mining communities in the United States – communities lacking
banks or financial intermediaries. But while adequate for the purchase of provisions at
the local general store, such forms of money were clearly an imperfect medium of
exchange and created otherwise unintended credit exposures between agents.
18

The recent market turbulence offers a further reminder of the importance of

resilient infrastructure for conditions in financial markets. When markets are fragile,
any interruption to normal service could have particularly serious implications: further
clouding judgements as to individual participants’ solvency; undermining agents’ risk
management; or affecting asset prices in dependent markets. With volumes and values
in several markets having hit record levels during the market turmoil and remaining
high for a sustained period, infrastructure providers have experienced a severe stress test
and, by and large, have passed with flying colours. CLS, for instance, processed nearly

4

860,000 transactions (more than $8trn in value) on 19th September, 2½ times the daily
average in June.
4. Current trends in the wholesale market infrastructure: new markets and new
demands.
19

Today, central banks around the world still typically provide the ultimate

settlement asset and sometimes operate, and also own, key components of the payment
and settlement infrastructure. For key elements of the infrastructure central banks have
assumed an oversight role. Depending on the particular regulatory architecture in place,
this is sometimes shared with the financial regulator, as in the UK.
20

But this is a dynamic environment: the landscape is broadening and deepening,

with niche market-specific facilities, cross-border systems, new entrants and
commercial bank providers becoming more important.

New sources of risk are

emerging, presenting new challenges for central banks in their pursuit of monetary and
financial stability.
Financial innovation and technological advancement
21

The way technology is transforming markets and therefore payment systems is

illustrated in the rapid growth in OTC derivatives markets; and the increased
penetration of electronic trading platforms – and automated trading strategies – across a
range of markets.
22

According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, notional

amounts outstanding in global OTC derivatives markets rose by almost 40% in 2006 –
up more than 260% over the past five years. The outstanding value of the credit
segment of the market doubled in value in 2006 alone and trading activity has remained
high through 2007, especially during the recent market turmoil.

5

23

These markets have traditionally been cleared and settled via bilateral

arrangements between the counterparties to the trade, but new automated infrastructure
services have emerged, partly in response to an international regulatory initiative led by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY). Major dealers now confirm almost
90% of credit derivatives trades electronically, as against less than 50% two years ago.
24

An important recent addition to the landscape is DTCC Deriv/SERV’s Trade

Information Warehouse, which maintains a so-called ‘golden copy’ of each credit
derivatives trade. With appropriate interoperability between systems, these data can
support a range of ancillary services: calculating and settling payment obligations,
managing collateral, terminating trades and reconciling portfolios. The Warehouse is
likely ultimately to be rolled out for other products.
25

The declining cost of technology has also been a key driver of the rise of

electronic trading in recent years. Almost 60% of trade in foreign exchange is now
executed electronically and close to 50% in repo.
26

Automated and algorithmic trading strategies are becoming more widespread

across asset classes. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) reports that the proportion of
the order flow on the exchange that is automated has risen from negligible amounts just
four or five years ago to approaching half today. This not only has implications for the
scale of trading activity – volumes have tripled on the LSE’s SETS system over the past
five years – but also the design and location of the trading infrastructure. For many
algorithmic trading strategies, processing speed is critical. The faster systems can
process trades in just one or two milliseconds: a tiny fraction of the blink of an eye. But
ultimately speed and thus the ability to gain a competitive advantage depends on
proximity to the platform; hence, the old geographical pull of markets has begun to re-

6

emerge with exchanges selling space near their trading platforms to those who want to
be first in the queue.
27

Many new entrants to the trading arena are therefore competing with

incumbent exchanges on the basis of processing speed. These new platforms are also
looking for lower cost post-trade solutions. As such, those emerging in Europe have
looked beyond incumbent providers: new entrants and commercial bank providers of
clearing and settlement services have featured strongly in their plans. Such providers
not only aim to meet demands in terms of flexibility and cost, but also to offer sufficient
breadth to deliver a multicurrency clearing and settlement service.
Globalisation, regulatory change and the market structure of infrastructure
28

This is part of a general reshaping of the infrastructural landscape in a global

market place. Market participants are becoming increasingly international, operating in
multiple markets and facing obligations in multiple currencies. Latest international
banking data from the Bank for International Settlements revealed growth in excess of
20% in reporting banks’ total cross-border claims in the year to end-Q1 2007, taking the
total to $28.5trn.
29

Banks, therefore, seek infrastructural solutions that will accommodate the

international organisation of their businesses.

So, while, historically, financial

infrastructure has typically evolved along national lines, cross-border alliances and
mergers are now more common, both in trading and post-trade: e.g., NYSE Euronext;
LCH.Clearnet; Euroclear Group. And alliances in the form of cross-border clearing and
settlement links are also widespread, enabling, for instance, securities traded in Italy to
be settled and held in an account in the securities settlement system in Germany.
30

Commercial bank providers – namely, correspondent banks and global

custodians – may be best placed to meet the demand for multicurrency settlement,

7

leveraging their extensive international connections. This could then reinforce their
important position in the infrastructural landscape. Indeed, the major global custodians
each posted growth in assets held in custody in excess of 20% in just the past year.
31

And differences between the regulatory regimes for incumbent providers of

infrastructure and those for either commercial bank providers or smaller new entrants
could tilt the playing field. For example, CLS is subject to close central bank scrutiny,
operates as a narrow bank, and has to meet exacting – and costly – resilience standards.
New clearing arrangements and bilateral netting schemes are now penetrating the
foreign exchange markets, threatening the volumes passing through CLS.

In

messaging, too, SWIFT – which submits voluntarily to central bank oversight – is
beginning to face competition in certain markets from new entrants not subject to
oversight. Authorities must be alert to the challenges these competitive developments
provide.
32

Other regulatory initiatives are contributing to a reshaping of the landscape.

MiFID, in the EU, and RegNMS, in the US, have sought to encourage increased
competition in trading; and the Code of Conduct, recently signed in the European
Union, establishes terms under which infrastructures operating in one member state can
clear and settle (initially equity) trades in another. More than 20 applications have now
been made under the terms of the Code.
33

Whether trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure markets can support a

wide range of providers in the long-term remains an open question. There is generally a
tendency towards concentration in infrastructure provision because of increasing returns
to scale in a fixed cost business and often powerful network effects. This applies
equally in the case of commercial bank provision of infrastructure: ECB survey
evidence reveals that the ten largest correspondent banks in euro account for around

8

80% of correspondent banking payment values; and the top-4 global custodians now
account for three-quarters of total assets in custody. Indeed, regulators have been
giving increasing attention to the potential systemic spillovers from operational or
business failures at major commercial bank providers of infrastructural services. That
has led, for example, to the initiative in the US to implement ‘New Bank’, a dormant
shell company to take over the functions should one of the two major clearers in the US
Treasury market cease operations.
34

It may be that a competitive environment can be sustained, particularly as the

cost of technology falls, lowering barriers to entry, and liquidity bridges and other forms
of interoperability are established between systems. But, the jury is still out. Recent
evidence on the trading side, particularly in the US, is mixed: some trading platforms,
such as Archipelago and INET, have been swallowed up by the incumbent exchanges;
others, such as BATS Trading are thriving, keeping the pressure on the exchanges to cut
costs and upgrade their services.
35

I suspect what we are seeing is a redefinition of the market on an international

scale. In the process, national incumbents are being challenged by a combination of
ambitious foreign incumbents eager to exploit economies of scale and nimble,
unencumbered new entrants sometimes specialising in niche products. A process that is
likely to lead in time to greater consolidation at international level is currently
manifesting itself in terms of fragmentation at the national level as local incumbents are
challenged.
36

The end-game may well be lower transaction costs at both the trade and post-

trade level and more concentrated (if not monopoly) cross-border infrastructure in each.
But it may take some time to reach a new equilibrium. Central banks and regulators

9

need not only to prepare for and perhaps help shape the end-game, but also address
challenges arising during the transition.
5. Issues and challenges for central banks and regulators going forward
37

Two key challenges, in particular, will need to be met:

(i) Preserve enough influence to protect the collective interest while maintaining a
level regulatory playing field
38

The resilience and efficiency of the core infrastructure is an important public

good and, given the tendency to monopoly, the authorities need to ensure that they
maintain sufficient influence to ensure resilience in this increasingly complex
landscape. That requires consistent and objective criteria to be applied to new as well as
established systems. Such criteria might include: size – the volume and value of flows;
type of flow – the extent to which interdependencies are generated with other systems or
underlying financial markets; and substitutability – the potential for rerouting flows to
other systems.
39

A changing market structure may also alter the nature of risks posed by the

systems themselves.

For instance, to the extent that we are entering a phase of

competing provision of services at the national level, issues might arise around the
potential fragmentation of system liquidity. Equally, we are also seeing pressures for
greater consolidation of systems at an international level, where the challenges of
lowering single point of failure risks remain at the top of the agenda.
40

Where new services are offered by commercial bank providers, central banks

need to cooperate closely with banking supervisors to ensure that potential sources of
financial stability risk in their infrastructure roles are embedded within regulatory
assessments. Indeed, to the extent that new services are multicurrency in nature an
international dialogue may be necessary. I am pleased that the Basel Committees on

10

Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) have
agreed to strengthen communication between the committees, for example by holding
joint meetings of sub-groups, which will help to support this dialogue
41

As recent events have underlined, regulation and public intervention can not

only change market incentives for the better but can also have unintended side effects.
For instance, the creation of the off-balance sheet vehicles at the centre of the recent
market turbulence may be seen in part as a response to the crude regime for capital
charges established under the original Basel Accord, under which liquidity facilities
under a year in maturity were exempt. That is being remedied under Basel II. But it is
a reminder that we need to be very careful to watch for these distortions in the
regulation and oversight of payment systems and other infrastructures, so as to ensure
that we do not inadvertently alter incentives in a way that may hamper the future
development of the landscape.
42

This issue arises for example in the context of the establishment of ESCB-CESR

standards for securities settlement systems. The Bank of England supports the principle
of risk-based functional regulation, which implies that regulatory standards should be
applied to a function – such as settlement – regardless of the status of the institution
providing that function. We hope that further moves towards implementation will
adhere to this principle, thereby establishing a level regulatory playing field at least
between CSDs and ICSDs, but ideally also between traditional infrastructures and
commercial banks offering infrastructural services.
43

Finally, with a wider spectrum of participants, issues arise around the way in

which members interface with infrastructures. It is important to ensure that individual
member behaviour cannot threaten the smooth-functioning of the system.

Some

incidents during the recent market turbulence revealed issues around members’

11

processing capacity, underlining the value in member-level testing to ensure that
participants can always support the delivery of the network benefits from the smooth
operation of the infrastructure.
(ii) Ensure effective international cooperation in oversight and operations, and
coordination in risk assessment activities
44

The second main challenge is to allow market participants to reap the benefits of

globalisation, while ensuring that the risks are adequately controlled. An extended and
highly connected network can simultaneously be both robust and fragile: robust,
because risks may be more effectively shared and dispersed across the system; fragile in
that major risks can flow more rapidly through the system.
45

Naturally, market participants have been pushing hard for the removal of

obstacles to efficient cross-border settlement and barriers to the seamless cross-currency
management of liquidity. Central banks have been urged to consider accepting foreign
collateral or implementing other arrangements to facilitate cross-currency liquidity
management. Some already do so – the Bank of England, for instance, routinely
accepts euro-denominated collateral in its operations – and a recent report from the
CPSS encouraged other central banks to consider accepting foreign collateral, at least in
emergency circumstances. The Eurosystem has recently begun to explore new options.
46

Provision of cross-border collateral arrangements may entail a high degree of

coordination and cooperation between central banks internationally, for instance in
opening custody and correspondent accounts, and sharing information on local
infrastructures and market practices.
47

More generally, strong international cooperation in the sphere of risk assessment

and crisis management responses is also clearly important.

With increased links

between infrastructure providers in different centres and the emergence of new cross-

12

border infrastructures, greater cooperation is also required in the conduct of oversight:
not only in terms of assessment of particular overseen cross-border infrastructures
against international standards, but also in identifying potential interdependencies
between national infrastructures. While existing cooperative arrangements work well,
the model needs to expand and continue to evolve.
6. Concluding remarks
48

The resilience of the infrastructure of wholesale payment, clearing and

settlement systems to both operational and financial shocks remains a key requirement
of financial and monetary stability. But the landscape is changing fast in response to
technological change and the financial innovation and globalisation it allows. Cross
border and global networks are squeezing our national monopolies and commercial
banks are playing an increasing role. These changes present several challenges for
central banks and regulators:
•

We need to establish and apply consistent criteria for the scope of oversight, in order
to maintain a level regulatory playing field;

•

We need to take full account of new interdependencies between systems when
assessing financial stability risks at a national and international level;

•

We need to work more closely together in risk assessment and oversight and ensure
that cross-border operational arrangements are robust ;

•

We need to ensure that financial stability risks posed by financial firms operating
key infrastructure functions are adequately captured in their regulation.

49

Meeting these challenges will deliver a robust, resilient financial infrastructure,

which the global financial system and the global economy depend upon.
