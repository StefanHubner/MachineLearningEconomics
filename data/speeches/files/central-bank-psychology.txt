13 September 2007 will be seen as a red letter day in financial history. It was the date news broke of
Northern Rock seeking emergency liquidity from the Bank of England, prompting the first run on a UK bank in
over a century. It also fired the starting gun on what subsequently became known as “The Great Recession”.
That very day, the Bank hosted a conference. In a painful irony, its theme was “The Great Moderation”.

The Great Moderation described the long-period of pre-crisis macro-economic calm, with stable growth, stable
1

inflation and stable banks. This view held that central banks, while not eliminating boom and bust, had
moderated macro-economic undulations. It also held that financial innovation, while not eliminating risk, had
scattered it to the four winds.

As Great Recession abruptly replaced Great Moderation, it was clear a grave analytical and policy error had
been made. Economic and financial pride had come before a momentous fall. Nemesis had duly followed
2

hubris. It was the coldest of comforts that this cognitive lapse was shared by the whole economic and
policy-making profession.

Clinical diagnoses of this failure will continue for some time. Was this an example of the intoxicating effect of
power, the anaesthetising effect of success, or the humbling effect of uncertainty? I do not know. But if nothing
else, this episode underlines the importance of cognitive constraints on decision-making when assessing the
robustness of policy.

Over recent years, there has been a huge amount of research on how human decision-making is affected by
3

various cognitive biases. Behavioural economics, the fusion of psychology and economics, has come of age.
4

There has also been a huge amount of research over many years on central bank decision-making. Yet the
link between the two – the psychology of central banking – has to date been largely unexplored territory.

5

I want to engage in a little amateur psychology by beginning to explore that terrain. Psychology tells us that
behavioural biases, because they are neurologically hard-wired, are often difficult to detect: they are
unconscious biases. Simply recognising the cognitive constraints on decision-making is thus a first step
towards making policy robust to them.

So too is institutional design. Indeed, I wish to argue that the evolution of central bank policy frameworks over
recent years can be seen as an attempt to make them robust to psychological biases. I want to illustrate that by

In Greek mythology, Nemesis was the spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris (arrogance before the Gods). The
term hubris now typically refers to a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or
capabilities.

areas where a further evolutionary “nudge” in those frameworks might be warranted.

Behavioural biases in practice
7

The literature on behavioural economics has sky-rocketed over recent years. This identifies a long list of
cognitive ticks that can affect human decision-making. All of these are likely to affect policy decision-making to
some degree. But from that potentially very long list, let me highlight four biases which may pose a particular
policy-making challenge.

Preference biases
Public policy involves making choices on society’s behalf. Society typically delegates these choices to an
individual or set of individuals, often either politicians or bureaucrats. That act of delegated authority means that
policy decisions usually involve both a principal (society) and an agent (such as government). The nature of
that principal/agent relationship then becomes crucial for effective policy.

8

Yet history suggests that this relationship is not always entirely harmonious. One potential source of friction is
that the agent may have preferences which are not perfectly aligned with society at large. This is human nature.
For example, it might arise from the agent putting personal objectives over societal ones, such as personal
power or wealth.

9

These problems have been widely studied in political and management science. In their extreme form, this
preference misalignment can manifest itself as autocracy (the pursuit of personal power at society’s expense) or
corruption (the pursuit of personal wealth at society’s expense). Historically, such “extractive regimes” have had
dire consequences for societal welfare. Indeed, they may explain “Why Nations Fail”.

10

Historically at least, the antidote to these preference problems is typically found in institutions – property rights,
the rule of law, democratic processes. Strong institutions have often laid the foundation on which nations have
been built. Typically, these institutional structures comprise an ex-ante mandate (agreed by society) and
ex-post accountability mechanisms (assessed by society). Colloquially, these are often called checks and
balances.

For example, electoral democracy is an institutional response to a potential preference misalignment between
the electorate and the polity. Parties publish manifestos ex-ante to set their mandate. And, if successful, they

are held accountable for that mandate by society ex-post through elections.

11

Democracy, and its associated

institutions, is the solution to an ageless principal/agent problem.

What is true at the level of the nation state is also true at the level of the firm and the individual. In firms,
principal-agent problems can arise because managers put their own preferences (for mega-mergers,
mega-bonuses, mega-jets) ahead of shareholders.
preferences (say, for an easy life) over managers.

12

13

They also arise from workers putting their own
Institutional structures – in this case, company and

employment law – can help solve these problems.

Among individuals, preference biases can also have negative societal implications. In the medical profession,
there is research arguing that doctors systematically over-prescribe drugs and over-admit patients to hospital.

14

Neither may be in the patients’, nor societies’, best interests. This is usually the result of doctors weighing their
own preferences (the risk of reputational or financial loss) over the patient’s (the risk of health problems
worsening).

Myopia biases

Psychological experiments show that people differ materially in their capacity to defer gratification. The classic
example is the “Marshmallow test” devised by Walter Mischel in the 1960s.

15

Mischel gave children at

Stanford University’s Bing Nursery School the choice between one marshmallow for immediate consumption or
two if the child waited.

Not only did children differ significantly in their ability to defer gratification. As researchers followed the fortunes
of these children as they grew older, a remarkable pattern emerged: children which had exhibited greater
patience in their pre-school marshmallow test subsequently outperformed their impatient counterparts in
everything from school examinations, to salaries, to reported levels of life satisfaction.

Subsequent sociological studies have established a longer list of ways in which impatient or myopic behaviour
influences human decision-making. Myopic individuals are more likely to smoke, to suffer alcohol and drug
addiction problems, to be obese and to have credit card debt problems.
across countries.

16

Myopia also differs significantly

17

To explain this, Richard Thaler developed a psychological model based on the “two selves”. In effect, each of
us comprises a patient “planner” and an impatient “doer”.

support to Thaler’s model, with different areas of the brain found to be responsible for patient and impatient
behaviours.

19

In practice, myopic behaviour appears often to hold sway in everyday decision-making. People appear
consistently to discount too heavily future rewards, a property called hyperbolic discounting.

20

This can explain

myopic saving behaviour by households and companies, when tomorrow’s consumption is brought forward to
today.

21

And it can explain political business cycles, when tomorrow’s GDP is brought forward to today.

22

Myopic behaviour also appears rife in risk decisions. People appear to exhibit risk myopia, discounting risk
events more heavily the longer the period that passes without that risk materialising.

23

This is the behaviour we

see from car drivers whose speed gradually increases after witnessing an accident. It was also the behaviour
we saw during the Great Moderation when financial markets suffered progressively greater risk myopia
(Chart 1).

Hubris biases

In 1965, psychologist Stuart Oskamp performed a multiple choice test on a group of psychology students based
on a case study. He also asked them to assign a confidence rating to their answer.

24

The students were then

given more information on the case study and asked to answer further questions with a confidence rating.
He found that additional information did nothing to improve the accuracy of the students’ answers. It did,
however, cause the confidence rating they attached to these answers to rise significantly. The addition of
information and experience led students to become over-precise, to over-estimate their abilities, to over-state
their performance.

There is no shortage of casual evidence of such hubris or over-confidence biases. 90% of faculty at the
University of Nebraska rate themselves as above-average teachers.

This means they are more likely to occupy positions of influence in the first place, whether Prime Minister or
CEO, though not Chief Economist.

28

But the same factor that pushes these individuals to the summit may also push them over the edge.
Over-confidence increases the risk of over-reach – for example, pursuing over-ambitious targets or undertaking
over-complex company takeovers, generating an above-average risk of systemic failure. That is why nemesis is
often thought to follow hubris.

What is true of those managing countries and companies appears to be no less true of those managing money.
Investment managers have consistently been found to over-estimate their abilities and traders consistently to
over-trade their positions. On average, there is little evidence of either consistently out-performing their peers.

29

Over-confidence effects tend to be more acute among individuals than groups, as groups dilute the influence of
hubristic individuals, as well as promoting a greater understanding of others’ perspectives. Consistent with that,
studies of decision-making by the US Supreme Court in the US have found benefits from expert, unelected
committees.

30

Groupthink biases

In 1951, Solomon Asch conducted a series of tests on a group of students. Each was asked in turn to state
which of three lines on a card matched the length of the line on a separate card.

31

The twist came in the fact

that all but one of the participants was an actor, primed to give the wrong answer. The real student, answering
last, then responded.
These Asch experiments found something remarkable. The unsuspecting student conformed to the group’s
wrong answers between a third and a half of the time. Their decision-making suffered a systematic conformity
bias. Interestingly, if as little as one dissenting view was added, this conformity bias was reduced by up to 75%.
In 1972, Irving Janis called this tendency for groups to act cohesively “groupthink”.

32

Janis focused on a

number of US political decisions to motivate this concept, the most celebrated of which was
President Kennedy’s decision to invade the Bay of Pigs in 1961. More recently, groupthink was used to explain
the Challenger space shuttle disaster.

33

Groupthink is the collective manifestation of confirmation bias - the tendency to search and synthesize
information in ways which confirm prior beliefs. This, rather than alcohol, is why drunks search for lost keys

34

Confirmation bias is prevalent in uncertain environments, where popular narratives are

used to filter uncertainties.

35

Psychologists such as Janis have identified a number of ways to mitigate groupthink or confirmation bias.
Actively encouraging dissent in groups is one. Seeking alternative perspectives from outside experts is a
second. And having the group chair state their preferences last is a third.

36

Evolution of Bank of England’s policy framework
Let me now describe the evolution of the UK’s macro-economic policy framework over the past half-century or
so. This is a journey whose starting point was a rules-based regime over which the Bank had little discretion
and whose finishing line is a regime over which the Bank exercises significant discretion.
For much of its 320-year history, the Bank of England’s role in UK economic policy was as operational agent.
The role of policy principal was played by government.

37

In the setting of monetary policy, the Bank’s role from

the end of the second world war through to the 1990s was as implementer, not decision-maker. The Bank had
little, if any, independence in the setting of monetary targets or instruments.

That changed progressively in the 1990s and decisively after 1997. Through the Bank of England Act 1998, the
Bank was granted operational independence for the setting of monetary policy in the UK, to meet an inflation
target set by government. Specifically, monetary policy came to be set by a nine-person
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), meeting monthly and comprising five Bank “internals” and four “externals”.

38

In the light of the crisis, the UK’s policy framework has been further changed. The Financial Services Act 2012
vested the Bank with further responsibilities, creating a new 10-person Financial Policy Committee (FPC),
meeting quarterly to execute macro-prudential policy. The FPC sets regulatory policy to ensure the stability of
the financial system as a whole. Like the MPC, it comprises both internals and externals.

39

The Financial Services Act also gave the Bank responsibility for micro-prudential supervision – ensuring the
safety and soundness of individual financial firms. This responsibility rests with the Prudential Regulation
Authority (PRA) at the Bank, specifically its Board. The PRA Board also comprises both Bank insiders and
outsiders.

40

So in a nutshell, for the first 300 years of its history the Bank of England operated as an agent of government.
In the subsequent 20 years, its degree of policy discretion has been transformed. It now comprises monetary,

macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy – a “3M” regime. The Bank’s span of responsibilities may well be
unique, at least among advanced economy central banks.

Though there are differences in detail, there are also striking elements of institutional similarity in the
decision-making architecture for monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy, as carried out by the
MPC, FPC and PRA respectively. Let me mention four features in particular:

(a) Goal dependence: The policy objectives of all three policy committees are set in statute by Parliament,
reflecting the attitudes of the electorate at large. In the language of economics, the 3M regime thus exhibits
“goal-dependence”.

41

Though different in detail, these objectives share some similarities. For example, the

MPC and FPC have a unique primary objective, augmented with a common secondary objective.

42

(b) Instrument independence: The policy instruments of the three policy committees are delegated, through
statute, to them. In other words, the settings of these instruments on a day-to-day basis are for the
Bank of England’s policy committees, subject to meeting the Parliamentary-set target. The 3M regime thus
exhibits “instrument-independence”.

(c) Committee-based decision-making: Decisions on monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy
rest with three Committees, rather than any one individual.

43

The Committees themselves vary in size from 9 to

11 people. They comprise a mix of Bank of England “internals” and “external” experts. Decisions are made
either by majority voting (MPC), consensus (PRA) or by consensus with a provision for majority voting (FPC).

(d) Transparency and accountability: The deliberations and decisions of each Committee are subject to public
scrutiny. The minutes of MPC and FPC policy meetings are published. All three Committees produce periodic
reports, tabled in Parliament, on their actions and analysis.

44

And members of each Committee appear

regularly before Parliamentary Committees. There is individual accountability, as well as collective
responsibility, for policy.

These institutional features are no historical accident. Each serves as a constraint on the policy discretion
exercised either by the Bank as agent or by its principal Parliament. The 3M policy regime is one of
“constrained discretion”.

45

Each of these constraints can, in turn, be seen as an institutional response to the

behavioural biases discussed earlier.

41

Debelle and Fischer (1994).
For example, for the MPC the remit specifies that the primary objective is to maintain price stability and, subject to that, the secondary
objective is to support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.

Behavioural Biases in Policy

So let me now link these institutional features to each of the behavioural biases. And let me also try to provide
some evidence on how successful these features have been in leaning against these biases. With elements of
this policy framework still fledgling, it is too early to reach definitive conclusions on some of its features.

Preference biases

The policy frameworks of the MPC, FPC and PRA Board share the feature that targets are set ex-ante in
legislation by Parliament acting on behalf of society. The policy mandates of the MPC, FPC and PRA are those
of the principal (society), not the agent (the Bank). The Bank is not setting its own exams.

Nor, ex post, is the Bank marking its own exams. For example, if the MPC fails to meet its 2% inflation target by
one percentage point in either direction, it is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor, setting out why
this happened and how the MPC intends to respond in returning inflation to target. And the Bank’s regular
policy reports set out the MPC, FPC and PRA’s intended actions and are subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.
These design features – ex-ante mandates and ex-post accountabilities - are explicitly designed to ensure the
actions of the Bank’s policy committees are well-aligned with society’s wishes. They are designed to reduce the
risk of the Bank becoming a mono-maniacal inflation-fighter or risk-slayer, with preferences out of kilter with
society’s.
To operate effectively, these institutional checks and balances need to be reasonably well-specified – for
example, the mandate needs to be clear and monitorable. On the monetary policy side, this is relatively
straightforward. The MPC’s inflation target is quantitative and observable. It also appears to be pretty
well-aligned with societal preferences.

The Bank conducts regular surveys of public attitudes towards the inflation target. They paint a consistent
picture. Around half of respondents think the 2% target for inflation is about right (Chart 2). The minority who
disagree are roughly evenly-split between those thinking it is too low and too high.

There is also a striking correlation between public attitudes towards the Bank and perceptions of inflation, with
the public seemingly strongly averse to above-target inflation rates (Chart 3). There is little sense that the Bank
may be acting like an “inflation-nutter”. This pattern is replicated internationally where inflation targets are
centred around 2% and survey evidence indicates a strong public aversion to inflation.

46

Even if public minds are made up on appropriate inflation targets, academics are not. Since the crisis, a
number of countries have operated near the zero bound for interest rates. It has been argued that targeting a

9

2% inflation rate results in this zero bound constraint binding too frequently, inhibiting the effectiveness of
monetary policy.

47

A higher target would loosen that constraint. This academic debate may run for some time.

On the financial stability side, the position is less straightforward. There is no single, easily observable or
quantifiable target for systemic risk against which to hold the FPC and PRA to account. And the public at large
often do not have well-defined or strong attitudes towards financial stability – except, perhaps, when things go
wrong.

Since 2012, the Bank has been surveying the general public on how they believe the Bank has performed in
protecting the financial system. Some reassurance can perhaps be taken from the fact that this has moved
from a net dissatisfaction score of 13 in 2012 to a net satisfaction score of 40 today.

48

Nonetheless, by itself this

approach falls well short of having a clear objective against which the FPC and PRA can periodically be
assessed.

The FPC has begun publishing a set of financial stability indicators against which it assesses systemic risk and
is held to account. And through the process of stress-testing the balance sheets of financial institutions, the
FPC and PRA are now laying out transparently the risk standard they are requiring from firms and from the
financial system as a whole and which is the subject of external scrutiny.
But this has not fully allayed occasional criticisms of the Bank’s regulatory policy choices. At various times, the
Bank has been warned against pursuing the stability of the graveyard or the tendencies of the Taliban. A
somewhat better defined financial stability anchor, set by Parliament and reflecting society’s desires, could over
time damp these criticisms.

In the 1950s and 1960s, central banks and academics strove to define an appropriate anchor for monetary
policy. That brought success, with inflation targets and attitudes now well-anchored. This gives grounds for
optimism that financial stability can follow the same path though, as monetary policy found, the journey is likely
to be long and arduous.

Myopia biases
The Bank’s monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy regimes all exhibit instrument
independence. Decisions are made by Committees of technocrats, operating at arms-length from the political
process. The case for delegation of policy responsibility is founded on myopia biases within society at large or
among its elected representatives.

In a monetary policy context, myopia tends to manifest itself as a desire to bring forward tomorrow’s income to
today, typically by setting monetary policy too loose. As one former US president is rumoured to have put it, “I
want tight money – and lots of it”. Myopia risks coming at the expense of higher inflation tomorrow. It imparts
an inflation bias.

49

What is true of monetary policy is equally true of regulatory policy. A desire to bring forward income may result
in regulatory policy also becoming too loose. As one former British Prime Minster put it, pre-crisis regulation
was “hugely inhibiting of efficient business by perfectly reasonable companies”.
the expense of a higher incidence of crises tomorrow. It imparts a crisis bias.

50

Myopia then risks coming at

51

Luckily, these temporal biases also have a potentially straightforward solution. This is to delegate
decision-making over monetary and regulatory policy to an agency less prone to myopia bias – an agent whose
time horizon stretches beyond the political business cycle. This is where central bank independence comes into
the picture.

The inflationary experience of the 1970s and early 1980s was taken by many as evidence of myopia-induced
inflation biases. Politicians had flunked the marshmallow test. In response, countries began granting central
banks greater degrees of monetary policy independence, as an institutional response to a behavioural bias.

52

This international trend was followed by the UK in 1997, when the Bank of England was granted operational
independence. Has this curbed the inflation bias? Chart 4 plots a measure of financial markets’ expectations of
UK inflation since 1985. Also shown is the date of Bank of England independence and inflation targets since
their inception in 1993.

These measures of inflation expectations were consistently and materially above target in the period prior to
independence – the myopia or inflation bias problem looked real. But from pretty much the point of
announcement of independence, they began ratcheting down. Within 12 months, they were aligned with the
inflation target. They have stayed there in the period since. The Bank of England has thus far passed the
marshmallow test.

Another lens is provided by looking at the stability of inflation and output either side of central bank
independence (Chart 5). Since independence, UK inflation variability has fallen by a factor of five and output
stability by a factor of almost two. As this period saw the largest macro-economic collapse in memory, it loads
the dice against independence.

This evidence may seem to suggest that central banks have tamed the inflationary tiger. That metaphor is apt.
Friedrich Hayek likened the process of controlling the economy as akin to taking a tiger by the tail.

53

As far as

inflation control is concerned, Hayek was right. As some countries are finding today, the tiger is capable of
biting back.

Chart 6 plots inflation expectations from financial markets in the UK, US, the euro-area and Japan over recent
years. In Japan, inflation expectations have been anything but well-anchored, varying significantly around a
trend close to zero. Most recently, they have been falling once again. The same is true in the euro-area and, to
lesser extent, in the US.

So far, inflation expectations in the UK have held up and, on a central view, the Bank expects inflation to be on
target at a 2-3 year horizon. But this tiger needs careful handling. Even in the UK, some measures of
household inflation expectations have fallen slightly over the course of this year. The tiger has stirred. Wearing
my MPC hat, and with UK inflation already below target, this is something I am watching like a dove.

For financial stability, quashing myopia-induced crisis biases is at an earlier stage. The long history of past
financial crises attests to that. Tellingly, history often ascribes political structures and incentives a key role in
determining which countries are most susceptible to crisis.

54

It tells us why financial regulation has repeatedly

failed the marshmallow test.

Nonetheless, there are institutional grounds for optimism. In the UK, the FPC and PRA have been created as
independent regulatory policy bodies housed under the Bank of England. They are a direct response to past
crisis myopia. They mimic the changes made to monetary policy 16 years ago and, at root, were done for the
same reasons.

For the FPC and PRA, still in their infancy, it is far too early to tell whether they will be able to quell future crises
more effectively than regimes in the past. Nonetheless, there are encouraging straws in the wind. Surveys of
market participants’ expectations of systemic risk – the closest analogue to inflation expectations on the
financial stability side – have subsided over recent years (Chart 7). How much of that is attributable to the new
regulatory regime, rather than external factors, is at present unclear.

Looking internationally, unlike with monetary policy, consensus has yet to be reached on whether regulatory
policy should also be set independently from government. A recent IMF study found only half of
macro-prudential regimes internationally were operated by central banks, though a number of others were in the
hands of independent regulators.

12

Perhaps with the passage of time that will change, as with monetary policy independence. Psychology
suggests it should. Because the risk cycle is even longer than the business cycle, myopia biases are even
more likely when tackling crises than inflation. The case for independence is at least as strong for regulatory
policy as it is for monetary policy.

56

Hubris biases
Under the UK’s new framework, decisions on monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy are made
by Committee, rather than by an individual. Committee members are individually accountable and drawn from
inside and outside the Bank. This structure provides some safeguard against over-confidence bias – for
example, by diluting the influence of any one individual’s views on policy decision-making.

There is evidence to support this in monetary policy decision-making. In the early days of the MPC, the Bank
used experimental evidence to assess the impact of committee decision-making. It found they made for better
decision than individuals, by eliminating the bad play of individuals but also by promoting learning among
Committee members.

57

Subsequent evidence from real-world MPC decision-making has found the same.

58

For effective information

aggregation, individual MPC members need to bring a diversity of views. While difficult to observe directly,
voting patterns suggest a reasonable degree of such diversity. There has been at least one member dissent
from an MPC decision at around half of all meetings (Chart 8).

External MPC members have contributed importantly to this diversity. On average, they have been around
twice as likely as internals to dissent from monetary policy decisions (Chart 9). And although less likely to be in
a minority, the Governor of the day has been outvoted on nine occasions.

59

Voting diversity does not of course prevent collective over-optimism. That might arise, for example, if the MPC
consistently over-estimated its ability to forecast the economy. Since 1996, the Bank has published forecast
paths for inflation and output growth, together with its assessment of the uncertainty around these estimates so-called “fan charts”.

60

Chart 10 shows the fan chart for inflation from the Bank’s most recent Inflation Report.

These fan charts allow us to conduct a real-world version of Oskamp’s experiment. Chart 11 plots the standard
deviation of the Bank’s fan charts for output and inflation over time. During the Great Moderation, forecast
errors shrunk. The MPC narrowed their fan charts in response, becoming more precise in their estimates of
future output and inflation.

Post-crisis, that picture has changed radically. Forecast errors increased. The fan charts were widened
significantly, almost doubling for both future output growth and inflation. Like psychology students of the 1950s,
there was a significant degree of pre-crisis over-precision by the MPC in their assessment of the economy.

Despite the post-crisis widening of the fan charts, it remains unclear whether the now higher degree of
uncertainty in the fan charts is correctly calibrated. Chart 12 looks at outcomes for output growth and inflation
since the crisis, relative to the MPC’s probability distribution at the one year horizon, broken down into 20%
buckets.

If the fan chart distribution had been roughly right, these outcomes would be equally distributed across the
buckets. They are not. In practice, output and inflation have fallen systemically into the tails of the distribution,
with around 50% in the outer 20% buckets.

Groupthink biases

A related, but distinct, decision-making defect is confirmation bias or its collective counterpart, groupthink. As
with other biases, the institutional structures of the MPC, FPC and PRA contain a number of safeguards.
Committee-based decision-making, with individual accountability and with the chair voting last, reduces the risk
of a single collective narrative. The degree of dissent across the MPC is also a positive diagnostic.

Nonetheless, Committee-based decision-making, especially by consensus, does not remove the risk of
conformity risk. Indeed, it could even propagate groupthink if cross-pollination becomes rather too effective. As
an illustration, Michael McMahon from Warwick University has undertaken a detailed text-based analysis of
MPC minutes to assess the importance of certain “topics” in shaping the MPC’s deliberations.
Chart 13 plots the incidence of discussion in the MPC minutes of topics around “banks”.

61

For the decade prior

to 2007, banking issues did not get much of a look-in. They typically accounted for only around 2% of MPC
discussion time during the Great Moderation. With hindsight, given emerging pressures in the banking sector,
this was a collective blind-spot.

The Northern Rock crisis of 2007, and the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008, made visible those pressures. In
response, Committee-time devoted to banking issues rose to a peak almost ten times higher than the pre-crisis
period. Today, discussion of banking issues has settled at levels below the crisis peaks, but above those in the
pre-crisis period.

The proportion of MPC discussion around banks bears a striking resemblance to market-based measures of
banking risk (Chart 14). Since these market-based measures were affected by risk illusion, it is reasonable to

61

This is part of a larger, on-going research project led by Stephen Hansen (UPF), Michael McMahon (Warwick) and Andrea Prat
(Columbia University).

assume the MPC suffered that same illusion. Just like the students in the Asch experiments, MPC yielded to
the wrong answers given by other financial actors. The MPC were looking for their keys under the wrong
lamppost.

It is too soon to tell whether any collective blind-spots remain. But compared with the pre-crisis period, the Bank
today has two extra pairs of policy eyes through the PRA and FPC. Joint meetings between the MPC, FPC and
the PRA Board now take place. These help strengthen the committees’ peripheral vision and are a safeguard
against groupthink.

As for economic forecasting, this is the most inexact of sciences. The Bank has already undertaken an external
review of its forecasting procedures.
and the transparency around it.

63

62

And it also has taken a sequence of measures to improve this process

This has included publishing more information on forecast inputs and outputs.

This is progress.
My own view is that improvements to the Bank’s forecasting process have some considerable distance still to
travel. Since the crisis, the Bank’s forecast errors for output and inflation, like those of external forecasters,
have tended to be one-sided and serially correlated (Chart 15).

64

So too, often more dramatically, have been its

forecast errors for real wages and productivity. To some degree this is understandable, as the MPC adapts to
the unfolding landscape.

65

But can we do much better? We must.

This brings me to my final point. The Bank is about to embark on what will be, in the area of research, a cultural
revolution. To caricature slightly, Bank research in the past was typically used to nourish and support the
Bank’s policy thinking and framework. Relatively rarely was it used to challenge that prevailing policy
orthodoxy, at least in public.

That is about to change. As part of its strategic plan, the Bank has decided to cut the umbilical cord. In future, it
will carry out, and publish externally, research covering the whole waterfront of policy issues it faces, monetary,
financial and regulatory. Through new publications, we will put into the public domain research and analysis
which as often challenges as supports the prevailing policy orthodoxy on certain key issues.

This research will hopefully act as spur and springboard for new policy thinking, and perhaps in time policy
change, on key central bank issues of the day, whatever they may be. It will act as another bulwark against
hubris, over-confidence and groupthink.

Conclusion

Behavioural biases afflict us all, in every activity from setting concrete to setting interest rates, from
stress-testing steel to stress-testing banks. Central banks cannot be immune. Because central banks’
judgements affect society at large and in large ways, it is important there are institutional means of safeguarding
against these biases.
The Bank of England’s new policy framework is part of the response to that challenge. By design, it contains
institutional safeguards against many of the biases most important for UK monetary and financial stability. But it
is early days. In developing this framework further, three principles will be important - recognition, research and
revision.

Because behaviour biases are often unconscious, recognising them is crucial for building robustness. Put
differently, denying their existence is proof of their importance! Research can help in identifying and
understanding these biases and assessing institutional means of leaning against them. The Bank hopes to
make a real behavioural change of its own on the research front in the years ahead.

Armed with that research, the Bank should be better-placed to make revisions to policy. Historically, flexing
policy frameworks has often been taken as a sign of regime failure. Quite the opposite ought to be the case. If
the Bank’s policy machine is to be robust over time, it will need to evolve and flex. If central bank regimes are
encased in glass, they are apt to shatter when next hit by a falling Rock.

Sources: Bank of England Systemic Risk Survey and Bank calculations. Notes: Respondents were asked for the probability of a highimpact event in the UK financial system in the short and medium term. From the 2009 H2 survey onwards, short term was defined as 0-12
months and medium term as 1-3 years. The net percentage balance is calculated by weighting responses as follows: very high (1), high
(0.5), medium (0), low (-0.5) and very low (-1). Bars show the contribution of each component to the net percentage balance.

Chart 10: CPI inflation projection from the November 2014 Inflation Report

Source: Bank of England November 2014 Inflation Report. Notes: It has been conditioned on the assumption that the stock of purchased
assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves remains at £375 billion throughout the forecast period. If economic circumstances
identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie
within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to
lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to
lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside
the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on pages 48–49 of
the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

Chart 13: Estimate of the proportion of MPC minutes covering the topic of ‘banking’

Source: Bank calculations. Notes: This chart shows the estimated allocation of each month’s MPC minutes to a topic which we label "banking". The words used
most frequently in the topic are bank(s)/banking/banker(s), credit(s), financial/finance, market(s), asset(s), condition(s), money and lend(s)/lending/lender. The
estimation of the topics, and the allocation of each set of minutes across all topics is completed using latent Dirichlet allocation as applied to FOMC transcripts in
Hansen et al (2014). The lines correspond to: September 2007 when Northern Rock received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England; September
2008 when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy; June 2011 when speculation and uncertainty about the euro area sovereign debt crisis started escalating;
June 2011 when ECB President Mario Draghi delivered his ‘whatever it takes’ speech.

Chartered, Santander UK, RBS, Barclays, LBG, HBOS, and HSBC but does not include Northern Rock.
