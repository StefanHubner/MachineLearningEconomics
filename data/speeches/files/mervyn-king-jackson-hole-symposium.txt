Jackson Hole speakers normally draw out the lessons of economic theory for one specific
area of policy. But this year we are trying to distil lessons from the practice of monetary
policy in the United States - over an extraordinarily successful quarter century under the
leadership of Alan Greenspan – for the theory of monetary policy.
At most celebrations of a long and successful career, invited speakers talk at length and the
great man himself is allowed a few minutes at the end. It is a remarkable tribute to Alan
that on this occasion the tradition has been turned on its head. We all remain intrigued by
what he has to say. In the few minutes I am allowed, I want to describe the three important
lessons that I have learnt from Alan during my time at the Bank of England.
First, to be a successful central banker requires an extraordinary degree of objectivity.
The key is to recognise that economics tells you how to think, not what to think.

It is not

a set of settled conclusions about issues. Above all, it is vital never to confuse the world
with a model. The whole point of a model is to abstract from a wide range of factors in
order to think clearly about one particular issue.
Let me describe an example of what I shall call “the Greenspan approach to economics”. It
concerns the ‘Lucas critique’. Robert Lucas’ 1976 paper encouraged economists to
construct models which incorporated explicit optimising behaviour by households and
firms. Unfortunately, some of them urged policy-makers to apply the lessons from their
models as literally as the enthusiasts of the engineering approach to macroeconomic policy
had done so in the 1950s and 1960s. The Greenspan approach to economics would advise
great caution. The insight of the Lucas critique is that we need to think about the responses
of rational households and firms when analysing the consequences of alternative policies.
But the likelihood that any particular model captures how the real economy would respond
to a given change in policy is vanishingly small. Lucas did not pretend that there existed a
single “true” model from which could be drawn unequivocal predictions about the impact
of policy changes.
The second lesson from Alan’s time at the Federal Reserve is that empirical knowledge is
not confined to the econometric analysis of official statistics. There are other and often

3
crucially important pieces of information that come to us in more qualitative form. These
include information from businesses about what they see happening in the economy.
Perhaps the most famous example of this in recent years is the productivity acceleration in
the US in the mid-1990s. The extensively revised official US data now show that
productivity began accelerating in 1995. However, that was not visible until the vintages
released in 1998. But as Alan Blinder and Ricardo Reiss have reminded us at this
conference, Chairman Greenspan did not wait until 1998 to conclude that the underlying
rate of productivity growth might be increasing. The key reason was that he talked with
and listened to people who work in business. Already in May 1996, when the Fed’s model
was forecasting increasing inflationary pressures going forward, Alan said “it is very
difficult to take the existing structure of the NAIRUs, capacity limits, and the usual
potential analysis that we do and square it in any measurable way with what we sense from
anecdotal reports”.1 In the UK, there does not seem to have been a productivity miracle.
But we have had many examples of the importance of qualitative data in making
judgements. For instance, there have been significant flows of migration that have
expanded the potential labour force. By their nature, such flows are not accurately
reflected in official data. But the Bank of England’s business contacts were able to tell us
that the ability to recruit new migrant workers was a growing and significant response to a
tight labour market.

The third lesson that Alan has taught us is that it is the consistency over time of a policy
framework that sustains a market economy, as the achievements of the United States over
the last 200 years show very clearly. Alan, of course, has stressed this in the context of
price stability. But it applies equally well to the system of taxes, property rights and public
goods provision on which prosperity in a market economy relies. Alan famously defined
price stability in the following terms: “price stability is best thought of as an environment
in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not materially enter into the
decisions of households and firms.” 2 I would suggest that implicit in this is a prescription
that Alan might write for all economic policies, not just monetary policy: namely, that
economic policy stability is best thought of as an environment in which the decisions of

Greenspan’s statement before the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, January

households and firms are not materially affected by the need to insure against future
arbitrary or mischievous changes in government policy. Just as Alan would define a good
monetary policy as one which leads people to stop talking about inflation, I think he would
call a good tax policy one under which people stop talking about the tax system.
In the last decade we have had a debate about whether such stability should be
implemented by quantitative targets or not. In monetary policy we have seen the spread of
‘inflation targets’, and targets have begun to permeate other areas of economic policy too.
You will not be surprised to learn that I think that such numerical targets have a role. But
whether they are appropriate or not is a subsidiary question, and it is one that is related to
the political economy of how to ensure the transparency of policy, the accountability of
those responsible for it, and the way in which households and firms form expectations of
policy: monetary, fiscal or other. Since the political economy varies from one country to
another, so will the appropriate method of achieving price stability in particular, and
economic policy stability in general. The crucial and overriding point is that a market
economy cannot flourish if policymakers behave in ways that lead private agents to expect
future economic policies – be those future monetary, fiscal, or legal policies – to be subject
to arbitrary or capricious changes.
Of course, an expectation of a stable regime will rarely translate into stable outcomes, and
it would be irresponsible of policymakers to let such a misconception take hold. A well
designed set of institutions will lead to responses being predictable, but cannot guarantee
that outcomes will be.
And there is a pressing issue here. In the US, inflation has been both low and rather stable.
Over the past decade it has varied between 1.0% and 3.8%, so we can with some
justification say that inflation no longer “materially enter[s] into the decisions of
households and firms.” In the UK inflation has, if anything, been even more stable. But
this success carries a risk for the future. Inflation expectations may be sensitive to a large
but temporary shock that moved inflation outside the range within which it has remained
for some years. With their belief in stability jolted, households’ inflation expectations
might move by much more than was justified by the temporary nature of the shock. That
would make it more difficult for the central bank to bring inflation back to target. The
moral of this particular story is that it may be risky to infer from the observation that

5
inflation expectations are stable that all is well. There will be times when large and
persistent shocks occur, and it would be unwise to count on inflation expectations
remaining stable when actual inflation starts to deviate substantially from its recent range.

So those are the three lessons that I have learnt from Alan: (i) a recognition that economics
is not a set of doctrines but a way of thinking; (ii) the importance of using qualitative and
quantitative information from a range of sources; (iii) there are a small number of
fundamental objectives that are crucial and which we can judge by the Greenspan yardstick
of whether we have freed businesses and households from the burden of expending
resources to deal with unnecessary policy volatility.
Alan’s departure from the central banking scene will deprive us of a source of wisdom,
inspiration and leadership. To be sure, Alan’s words, whether spoken or written, will
surely still reach us from the sidelines. To use a tennis analogy, I see Alan as the central
banking equivalent of the non-playing captain of a Davis Cup team, encouraging the
younger and less talented members, and stressing the importance of footwork, timing and
getting into position early.
Alan, thank you for raising the respect which others give to our discipline of economics
and our profession of central banking.
