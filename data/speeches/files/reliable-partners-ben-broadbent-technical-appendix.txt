This Appendix provides further details of the simulations reported in Charts 4, 5 and 6.
We use a simple New Keynesian model, in which each time period, 𝑡, is one quarter of a
year:
𝑥𝑡 =
𝜋𝑡 − 𝜋 ∗ =

𝛿𝔼𝑡 𝑥𝑡+1 − 𝜎𝛿(𝑖𝑡 − 𝔼𝑡 𝜋𝑡+1 − 𝑟𝑡∗ )
𝛽𝔼𝑡 (𝜋𝑡+1 − 𝜋 ∗ ) + 𝜅𝑥𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡

where 𝑥 is the output gap, 𝜋 denotes inflation and 𝜋 ∗ denotes the inflation target. Following
Haberis, Harrison, and Waldron (2019)1, we set 𝜎 = 1 and 𝜅 = 0.025. We set 𝛽 = 0.995.
Textbook New Keynesian models (for example Woodford 20032; Galı́ 20083) typically
assume that 𝛿 = 1. This in turn implies that the effect on the output gap of a change in the
real interest rate in the very distant future is identical to the effect of a change in the
short-term real interest rate. That property of the model gives rise to the so-called ‘forward
guidance puzzle’ (Del Negro, Giannoni, and Patterson 20154; Gabaix 20205). A variety of
small changes to the underlying textbook model give rise to an equation for aggregate
demand with 𝛿 < 1 so that changes in the real interest rate in the distant future have
strictly less effect on spending today than changes in real interest rates in the near term.
Our implementation follows Rannenberg (2021)6 and we set 𝛿 = 0.9, midway between the
values of 0.85 and 0.96 used by Gabaix (2020) and Rannenberg (2021) respectively.
The model is driven by two exogenous shocks, which follow simple stochastic processes:
𝑟𝑡∗ − 𝑅∗ =
𝑢𝑡 =

∗
𝜌𝑟 ∗ (𝑟𝑡−1
− 𝑅∗ ) + 𝑠𝑟 ∗ 𝜀𝑡𝑟
𝑢
𝑠𝑢 𝜀𝑡

∗

∗

where 𝜀𝑡𝑟 , 𝜀𝑡𝑢 ∼ ℕ(0,1). We set 𝜌𝑟 ∗ = 0.85 following Haberis, Harrison, and Waldron (2019)
and choose 𝑠𝑟 ∗ and 𝑠𝑢 so that the model implied variances of inflation, output gap and the
short-term interest rate are similar to those in the data.7 The values chosen are 𝑠𝑟 ∗ =
0.4, 𝑠𝑢 = 0.15.
The loss function used to guide monetary policy and evaluate outcomes is

and ℒ denotes the ‘period loss’ and we set 𝜆 = 0.25. This is somewhat higher than the
values often implied by approximations to the utility of representative households in a
textbook model (for example Woodford 2003; Galı́ 2008) but closer to the values often
used by policymakers in indicative simulations (for example, Yellen 20128; Carney 20179).

Our baseline assumptions for monetary policy assume that the policymaker sets the
nominal interest rate to minimize (1), subject to a lower bound on the nominal interest rate:
𝑖𝑡 ≥ 𝑏
and the lower bound is imposed in the simulations using the algorithms described in
Harrison and Waldron (2021).10
The average distance of the interest rate from the lower bound is given by 𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋 ∗ − 𝑏. We
simulate the model for alternative assumptions about the average amount of policy space
and the conduct of monetary policy. In each case, the model is simulated for 256,000
periods and the average period loss, ℒ, is computed. The charts in the main text plot the
square root of this loss, normalised to 1 for the case of commitment policy with 5%
average policy space.
The model is simulated under four alternative assumptions about the conduct of monetary
policy:
Discretionary policy: the policymaker sets the interest rate in a time-consistent manner to
minimize (1). Time consistent policy means that the policymaker sets policy optimally
today recognising that future policymakers will act in the same way. So today’s
policymaker cannot influence future policy actions and therefore cannot make credible
commitments about the future path of the interest rate.
Commitment policy: the policymaker sets the interest rate according to a policy rule that
minimises (1) under commitment. The commitment policy allows the policymaker to
influence output and inflation in the near term by making credible promises about the
behaviour of interest rates in the future.
Imperfectly credible commitment policy: the policymaker sets the interest rate
according to a policy rule that minimises (1) under commitment but recognising that private
agents believe that the policymaker will switch to the discretionary policy with a constant
(5%) probability each period. Even though the policymaker never switches from the
commitment policy, the fact that agents doubt the credibility of the policymaker’s
commitments implies that credible promises about the behaviour of interest rates in the
future have less traction over output and inflation in the near term.
Unresponsive policy: every 𝑁 periods the policymaker announces a path for the interest
rate over the next 𝐾 periods. The policymaker then follows the plan (for the 𝑁 − 1
subsequent periods) and then announces a new path and the process repeats. Each
announced path is consistent with the path for the interest rate under optimal commitment,
conditional on no future shocks arriving. Because shocks subsequently do arrive, the
policymaker is therefore unresponsive to the economic news (interest rates are set
according to the pre-announced plan). For simplicity we consider the case in which 𝑁 = 2
and 𝐾 = 4.
