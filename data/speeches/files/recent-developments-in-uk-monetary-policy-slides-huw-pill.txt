Sources: Refinitiv Eikon from LSEG, S&P Global/CIPS and Bank of England calculations
Notes: Indicators are estimated by Bank staff using principal component analysis on a range of PMIs for supply constraints in the manufacturing sector (supplier delivery times, stocks of
purchases, stocks of finished goods, input prices and backlogs of work). Before principal components are estimated, these indicators are regressed on the new orders PMI to control for
movements in demand. Latest data for the Global and China series are for March 2023, and April 2023 for the US and the euro-area series

Global goods inflation rose owing to bottlenecks

Source: Refinitiv Eikon Datastream, JPM Global PMI index and Bank of England calculations
Notes: ‘Global non-UK PPI’ is the average of PPIs from the Euro area (manufacturing PPI), US, China, Switzerland, India, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong, Sweden, Canada, South Africa, Denmark,
South Korea and Singapore, weighted by their shares of UK imports. These economies account for over 90% of UK imports

Typical frequency of price changes
Sources: Decision Maker Panel survey and Bank of England calculations
Notes: The latest data are from the May 2023 Survey. The results on frequency of price changes are based on the question: ‘Approximately how often did your prices change in each of the following years?’.
Respondents were then asked to choose one of the following options for both year 2019 and 2022: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half‐yearly, annually, and prices did not change.

Sensitivity of firm pricing decisions to cost shocks

Sources: Decision Maker Panel survey and Bank of England calculations
Notes: The latest data are from the May 2023 Survey. Question wording – ‘Which of the following best describes how your business usually sets prices?’; (i) ‘Mostly change prices in response to specific events
(e.g. changes in costs or demand)’ (= state‐dependent pricing); (ii) ‘Mostly change prices at fixed intervals (e.g. once a year or once a quarter, etc.)’ (= time‐dependent pricing)
.

Notes: Three‐month moving averages. Realised price growth (lines) are responses to the question: ‘Looking back, from 12 months ago to now, what was the approximate % change in the average
price you charge, considering all products and services?’. The latest data are from the May 2023 Survey. Expected price growth (diamonds) are responses to the question: ‘Looking ahead, from now
to 12 months from now, what approximate % change in your average price would you expect in each of the following scenarios: lowest, low, middle, high and highest?’, and respondents are asked to
assign a probability to each scenario which is used to create a weighted average expectation of price growth..

Changes in wage setting / pricing behaviour for services?

Sources: ONS, Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and Bank of England calculations
Notes: Wages are Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) private sector regular pay; ‘underlying’ measure removes pandemic-related compositional effects. REC indicator of staff permanent staff salaries is
mean-variance adjusted to match wage growth over 2002-19. REC indicator 12-month lag gives best correlation with 12-month wage growth over 2002-19

Changing slope of the wage Phillips curve

Sources: ONS and Bank of England calculations
Notes: Wage growth is Average Employee Income (AEI) until 2010 and Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) since. Inflation expectations are implied by the indexed gilt market.

Monetary policy transmission in the UK

Sources: Cesa-Bianchi, Thwaites and Vicondoa (2020) and Bank of England calculations
Notes: Thanks to Mauricio Salgado Moreno for his work in updating these estimates and comparing across different sample periods. The estimates shown here are derived from a sample
period until end-2019. The charts show local projections of monetary policy shocks identified using the innovation in the second short-term interest rate future in a narrow window around the
announcement of monetary policy decisions. The model is estimated in levels using monthly data

Changing structure of UK mortgage market (1)

Sources: Bank of England
Notes: The latest data points are March 2023. The Bank’s quoted and effective rates series are weighted averages of rates from a sample of banks and building societies with products meeting the specific
criteria, such as being widely accessible. The data are sterling-only monthly averages and are not seasonally adjusted

Changing structure of UK mortgage market (2)
Impact of change in Bank Rate on mortgage payments, % of consumption
(based on micro cash‐flow analysis)

Sources: Bank of England calculations
Notes: Chart shows estimates of the impact of changes in mortgage rates on consumption, based on the maturity profile of the stock of mortgages at the end of 2021. Up until 2023 Q1, it assumes fixed-rate mortgages were remortgaged at the effective rate on new lending. Variable-rate mortgages are assumed to change in line with changes in Bank Rate. Beyond that, it uses a projection for quoted rates on new secured lending for households,
taking into account the market-implied path for interest rates. Figures are shown relative to nominal consumption in 2021, and assume that on average households reduce consumption by 40 pence for every £1 increase in
their mortgage repayments
