"Inspiration is most likely to come through the stimulus provided by
the patterns, puzzles and anomalies revealed by the systematic
gathering of data, particularly when the prime need is to break our
existing habits of thought"
Ronald Coase, Nobel Prize lecture (1991)
In this lecture I am going to consider the similarities and differences between
European labour markets. This is going to be grounded in various pieces of research I
have done in this area. A good deal of this work is joint with Andrew Oswald, and
involves examining micro­data files on individuals across space and through time. It
mostly involves estimating equations of a similar form across countries. Our main
focus has been on comparisons between EU countries and the USA but we have also
looked at other OECD countries. What is striking is how similar the various patterns
in the data we observe are, despite the different labour market institutions. Following
Harberger (1993), I think of economics as essentially an observational discipline.
I will start by sketching out the evolution of unemployment across Europe and the US
over the past 50 years or so. I will then look at the received wisdom that has been
used to explain the changes we observe, which suggests the importance of labour
market institutions. Somewhat surprisingly I find little supporting evidence for such
claims. I will then go on to consider the implications of unemployment for wages,
finding considerable stability in the impacts across countries. The talk will culminate
with a discussion of happiness and people's preferences between unemployment and
inflation, which is the subject of a new paper I am releasing today (Blanchflower
2007). The main conclusion of this lecture may be rather surprising: there are more
similarities than there are differences in the observed patterns across EU labour
markets. Perhaps this finding is much less surprising in light of recent developments
in financial markets, reinforcing the message that we are operating in a global
economy.
1) Unemployment
I will assume for simplicity that the ILO unemployment rate is a measure of labour
market slack. Table 1 sets out the relevant decadal averages for the EU15 plus Japan
and the USA. A number of observations can be made.
1) Unemployment was low in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.
2) It was considerably higher in the 1980s and 1990s and has fallen again in the
00s.
3) Unemployment has been particularly high since the 1980s in France,
Germany, Italy and Spain.
4) Unemployment has remained low in the Northern European countries of
Sweden, Norway and Denmark plus Japan.
5) Unemployment dropped dramatically in Ireland in the 2000s and increased
strongly in Finland from the 1990s.
Is the explanation for the differences in unemployment experiences across countries
due to their labour market institutions? Probably not. For example, the decline in
unemployment in Ireland in the 2000’s was not brought about by reforms of the
labour market institutions but by tax and product market reforms. Similarly the
increase in unemployment in the 1990s in Finland was not driven by labour market

2

reform, but was in part the result of the collapse of its preferred bilateral trade deal
with Russia.
Chart 1 makes it clear that unemployment has been higher in Europe as a whole than
in the US over the past 20 years, but prior to the 1980s the reverse was true. That
picture is also true for the UK – unemployment rates up to the 1980s were below US
rates and then during the 1990s they were higher. I remember the time of the switch
well. I was a member of the Centre for Labour Economics at the LSE and every week
we would attend the Unemployment Seminar and try to work out why unemployment
had risen so rapidly. Subsequently, the explanation, notably as set out by Layard,
Nickell and Jackman (2005)1, tells us that this switch was brought about by the oil
price shocks of the 1970s interacting with supply­side rigidities in the EU, such as
union power and more generous and easily available benefits. As the oil price rose,
unions across the EU resisted falls in real wages, causing the NAIRU to rise, while a
more generous benefit system reduced the fear of unemployment. In contrast, US
workers’ real wages adjusted down, and unemployment increased less. Given the
apparent causes of the increase, the policy prescription required to solve the
unemployment problem was to undertake structural labour market reforms to remove
these rigidities.
That is an interesting theoretical story. Unfortunately, as I set out in Blanchflower
(2001), it turns out that there is little or no connection in the actual data between
changes in most of the various labour market rigidity variables and changes in
unemployment. Indeed, Charts 2­6 illustrate that it is difficult to show any significant
relationships between rigidity variables and levels and changes in unemployment rates
even in the raw data.2
a). Benefit duration
Chart 2 shows unemployment rates across 20 OECD countries in 2002 against the
ratio of the net replacement rate in the 60th month of benefit receipts to their value in
the first month of entitlement. The traditional view is that long duration benefits help
to explain high unemployment, but this chart seems to suggest a negative correlation
between these variables.
b). Employment protection
Chart 3 plots from 1980­1998 for three five year periods and one four year period
(1995­1998) the unemployment rate against a job protection index for each OECD
country. No significant relationship is found. Interestingly, in a recent paper
published by the OECD (2004) it was shown that Ireland had very low job protection
rates at the end of the 1980s and none of the various indicators they reported for
Ireland had subsequently changed! Overall job protection strictness measures for
Ireland estimated by the OECD for 2003 ranked below every country except Canada,
the UK and the USA. Changes in the unemployment rate in Ireland had more to do
with housing, product and tax reforms than with labour market reforms.

c). Trade unions
Chart 4 plots from 1980­1998 for three five year periods and one four year period
(1995­1998) the unemployment rate against union density for each OECD country.
There is no significant relationship. The World Bank has recently argued as follows.
"Union density per se has a very weak association, or perhaps no
association, with economic performance indicators such as the
unemployment rate, inflation, the employment rate, real compensation
growth, labor supply, adjustment speed to wage shocks, real wage
flexibility, and labor and total factor productivity." Aidt and
Tzannatos (2002, p.11)
d). Changes in replacement rates
However, there is evidence in Chart 5 that changes in gross replacement rates and
changes in unemployment rates between 1982 and 2002 have the expected positive
sign (R2=.075). Oswald and I have also found evidence for the role of benefits in
explaining unemployment across US states.
e) Inequality
What is clear though is that countries that rely on institutions to set wages and
working conditions do have lower rates of inequality or dispersion of earnings. The
US, which ranks as the most market­driven labor market, has the highest dispersion of
wages. Other economies with relatively market­driven labor markets also have high
levels of inequality. By contrast, Norway, where institutions set wages, has the
lowest dispersion.
f). Labour market deregulation
A central pillar of OECD labor market policy has been that reforms that reduce labor
market rigidities are the answer to persistent high unemployment. An enumeration of
such reforms was carried out by the OECD (1999) as part of its follow­up to the Jobs
Study (OECD 1994). Howell et al. (2007) created an index based on a list of reforms
related to unemployment benefits, employment protection, and wage bargaining
systems, as these constitute the key labor market institutions typically regarded as
employment­unfriendly. Chart 6 is taken from their study and shows no significant
relationship between this measure of deregulation and the change in unemployment
across OECD countries
The orthodox rigidity explanation of unemployment has been subject to fairly
extensive econometric testing, and in recent years, the validity of the empirical results
supporting this view has been called into question. To put it technically, it has proved
difficult to estimate a set of cross­country panel unemployment regressions that
contain a lagged unemployment rate and a full set of year and country dummies and
show that any of the labour market rigidity variables work. This is the first main
similarity between European labour markets: labour market institutions do not tend to
cause unemployment. The major exception is changes in the replacement rate, which
do appear to be negatively correlated with changes in the unemployment rate.

4

In a recent article, Howell et al (2007) econometrically examined the impact of these
rigidity variables, or what they call Protective Labor Market Institutions (PLMIs), and
concluded that:
“While significant impacts for employment protection, benefit
generosity, and union strength have been reported, the clear conclusion
from our review of these studies is that the effects for the PLMIs is
distinctly unrobust, with widely divergent coefficients and levels of
significance.”
Howell et al. (2007) go on to argue a point of view I have held for quite some time,
that the confidence with which labor market rigidities are held to be the root of poor
employment performance is in contrast to the fragility of the findings.
Indeed, in his published comments on the Howell et al. article, Nobel Laureate, Jim
Heckman (2007) concurs, arguing that the authors
“…are convincing in showing the fragility of the evidence on the role
of labour market institutions in explaining the pattern of European
unemployment, using standard econometric methodology.”
Freeman (2007) also finds the evidence for the impact of these institutional variables
less than convincing.
“Movement toward market­determined pay widens earnings
distributions....By contrast, despite considerable effort, researchers
have not pinned down the effects, if any, of institutions on other
aggregate economic outcomes, such as unemployment and
employment”
What is true is that unemployment in Europe is higher than it is in the United States
and Western Europe has more job protection, higher unemployment benefits, more
union power, and a more generous welfare state. But that is a cross­section
correlation and it tells us little or nothing about time series changes. That leaves us
looking for alternative explanations for the observed crossing of US and European
unemployment rates in the 1980s.
I’m now going to set you a brief challenge – can you think of another series that has
followed a similar trend to that of unemployment rates in the UK and US, i.e.
a) Was lower in the UK than in the US for the period 1945­1980
b) Was higher in the subsequent period.
I’ll even give you a hand by showing you the series in Chart 7. Well I’ll put you out
of your misery – it’s the housing market, and the home ownership rate more
specifically. This seems pretty topical these days.
It seems that unemployment is positively correlated with changes in rates of home
ownership. I would characterise this as a major similarity between European labour
markets. Chart 7 shows the relationship for the US and the UK, but the evidence

5

holds for many more countries. Of the major industrial nations Spain has the highest
unemployment and the highest rate of home ownership and Switzerland the lowest
unemployment and the lowest rate of home ownership. During the 1990s there were
three European countries with unemployment rates close to 20% and these three had
the highest home ownership rates (Ireland, Spain and Finland).
In the 1950s and 1960s the United States had the highest unemployment and the
highest rate of home ownership. This pattern also holds within US states: for
example, Michigan has both a high unemployment rate (6.9% in 2006) and a high
home ownership rate (77.4%), while California has a low unemployment rate (4.9%
in 2006) and a low homeownership rate (60.2%). In new work for the US Andrew
Oswald and I have estimated a state level unemployment equation for the period
1977­2006 with a lagged dependent variable and a full set of year and state dummies.
Home ownership lagged two or more years enters significantly and positive. Union
status is insignificant.3 Higher home ownership raises unemployment, presumably
because it reduces labour market mobility.
Over the past few decades European governments have made concerted efforts to
reduce the size of the private rented sector and to increase home ownership. Yet
homeowners are relatively immobile, partly because they find it much more costly
than private renters to move around. Unemployment rates have grown most rapidly in
the nations with the fastest growth in home ownership. Workers in Michigan laid off
from GM own their own homes which they can't sell and it is hard then for them to
move to new jobs in other parts of the country. The large increase in European home
ownership has considerable advantage over the other possible explanations for the rise
in unemployment – it seems to fit the data!
In a recent paper written with my colleague Chris Shadforth (2007a), we examined
the striking growth in self­employment that has been observed in the UK over the past
couple of years. Self­employment accounts for about 13% of the stock of workers.
However, over the period May­June 2005 to May­June 2007 self­employment
accounted for 199,000 out of an increase in total employment 356,000 or 56% of total
job growth.4 We estimate that approximately half of this growth in self­employment
could be explained by the rise in house prices freeing up capital constraints. What
goes on in the housing market, matters for the labour market.
In the very first meeting of my introductory Labour Economics class I tell the students
that the demand for labour is a derived demand, derived from the demand for the
product. Reforming the labour market is unlikely to work if you don’t reform the
product market. In the absence of freely functioning capital and housing markets the
labour market can’t work efficiently. There is much work still to do in this area but
the role of labour and capital mobility in improving the functioning of the labour
market seems to be important. Reforming the product, capital and housing markets

are likely more important than reforming the labour market. The labour market
follows.
2) Wages
So that is what has happened to unemployment, but what are the consequences of
unemployment? I’m now going to talk briefly about the impact of unemployment on
wages.
The relationship between wage inflation and unemployment is usually thought of as
being described by the Phillips curve, but the empirical evidence does not provide
much support for the theory. The results of estimated Phillips curve relationships ­
that is how the level of unemployment impacts wage inflation ­ appear to be time­
specific, data­specific and/or country­specific.
There is evidence of a downward­sloping Phillips curve in the UK at points during the
1970s and 1980s, but since the 1990s the curve has been flat (Chart 8). In other
words, for the past 15 or so years there has been no trade­off between (wage) inflation
and unemployment. But that does not mean there isn’t a relationship between wages
and unemployment. For many years I have argued for the use of micro data and
described an empirical regularity or law linking the level of pay to the unemployment
rate in the local area – known as the wage curve (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994).
This was the title of the book Andrew Oswald and I published in the 1990s which
documented this pattern across sixteen countries; for these countries we found that the
data are well described by a wage curve with an unemployment elasticity of
approximately ­0.1 – in other words a doubling of the unemployment rate is
associated with a ten percent decline in the level of the real wage.
Just to be clear, there is evidence of a stable relationship between changes in real
wages and changes in unemployment (the wage curve). In contrast there is no
evidence of a relationship between changes in the real wage and the level of
unemployment (the Phillips curve). This empirical finding has subsequently been
verified for 43 countries and many time periods some by us and by many other
authors.5 It suggests that macroeconomic time series analyses of the labor market
suffer from aggregation and missing variable biases of uncertain sign and magnitude.
An extensive meta­analysis was conducted by Nijkamp and Poot (2005) on a sample
of 208 wage/unemployment wage curve elasticities from the literature, and concluded
that, unlike the Phillips curve, the wage curve is… “an empirical phenomenon”.
Chart 9 shows such a wage curve, traced out for the EU15 countries (excluding Spain)
and US for the period 1995­2005. It plots changes in real wages on changes in
unemployment rates by country from 1995­2005. It is clear that the countries
experiencing the highest falls in unemployment over the period also experienced the
largest increases in real wages.
5

Wage curves have been found in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso, Canada, Chile, China, Côte d'Ivoire, Czech Republic, Denmark, East Germany, Estonia,
Finland, France, Great Britain/UK, Holland, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, USA, and West Germany (Blanchflower and Oswald,
2005).

Sanz­de­Galdeano and Turunen (2006) examined the wage curve for the Euro area
over the period 1994–2001. They found that the overall unemployment elasticity in
the euro area is ­0.14 once they had controlled for individual level fixed effects.6 The
elasticity varies across groups of workers. They found that wages of workers at the
bottom of the distribution are more responsive to the local unemployment rate.
Based on these findings, I would characterize a major similarity in European labour
markets to be the existence of remarkably similar wage curves. Why do we find
evidence of wage curves, but not Phillips curves? Margo (1993) cites two principal
reasons related to the use of microeconomic versus macroeconomic data, the former
being typically used for the estimation of wage curves and the latter for Phillips
curves. First, less­aggregated data provide many more degrees of freedom than a
decade or so of time series data. And second, he suggests that work at a lower level
of aggregation can reveal aspects of human behaviour that lie hidden in the aggregate
time series.
A number of authors, including myself, have attempted to model the Phillips curve
using micro data, controlling for country/region and time fixed effects. When we do,
we find that the autoregressive nature of the macroeconomic theory tends to disappear
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005).
These two factors suggest that much
macroeconomic data is suspect as it suffers from aggregation biases of uncertain sign
and magnitude. Except in isolated specifications, there is not persuasive support for a
simple Phillips curve. It seems more sensible to view the data as being characterized
by dynamic fluctuations around a long­run stable wage curve.
So what has happened to wages in the UK in recent times? Over the last two years
wage growth in the UK has been benign. For example, average earnings growth
without bonuses was 4.2% (4.6%) in July 2005; 3.3% (3.9%) in July 2006 and 3.7%
(3.8%) in July 2007, with the numbers in parentheses with bonuses.7 These surveys
exclude workers in the smallest workplaces of less than twenty workers whose wages
are the most flexible downwards. Wage settlements over the last year have remained
flat. Part of the reason for this is given by the wage curve – wage pressures have been
constrained because unemployment has increased.
The degree of slack in the labour market directly influences wage pressures, and it can
also impact migration, which itself can have second­round effects on pay. The UK,
Ireland and Sweden were the only countries to fully open their borders to workers
from the eight Eastern European EU accession countries in May 2004. 8 These
workers have helped to contain wage pressures in the UK by increasing the labour
force available to UK firms, both by moving to the UK to fill vacancies in low skilled,

low paid jobs, but also by providing out­sourcing opportunities in their home nations.
The increase in available workers has therefore increased the ‘threat’ of
unemployment for UK workers (Blanchflower, 1991), which tends to have a
downward impact on pay especially in the non­union sector. The fear of
unemployment lowers wages.
One measure of the ‘threat’, and the fact that it has increased in the UK since A8
accession, is captured in a monthly survey of consumers conducted by the European
Union. The Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European
Commission conducts regular harmonised surveys for consumers in which they are
asked: “How do you expect the number of people unemployed in this country to
change over the next twelve months? The number will a) increase sharply b) increase
slightly c) remain the same d) fall slightly e) fall sharply f) don’t know.” The answers
obtained from the survey are aggregated into a survey ‘balance’. Balances are
constructed as the difference between the proportion giving positive and negative
replies. Chart 10 shows a clear correlation between changes in the fear of
unemployment and actual unemployment over the past few years in the UK. Fear of
unemployment has also risen in Ireland, where there has also been a significant inflow
of workers from Eastern Europe, even though unemployment has remained low. In
contrast, Chart 11 shows that the fear of unemployment has not risen across the rest of
the EU, i.e. in those countries that didn’t open their borders to A8 workers. In
combination with rising unemployment, the ‘fear’ of unemployment is likely to have
contained wage pressures in the UK. Here is an example of a major difference across
EU countries.
c) Happiness, unemployment and inflation
So far I have pursued the general theme that institutions have less influence on
unemployment than has previously been considered to be the case. By examining
micro data, we have seen that rather than there being a trade off between wage
inflation and unemployment in recent years, in fact it is the level of the real wage that
is linked to changes in the unemployment rate. Now, before concluding, I’m going to
consider the same issues, but from a different perspective, and look at preferences
between unemployment and inflation, based on a paper I am releasing today. This
paper is available from the Bank’s website now.
The paper I am releasing has its roots in work that I and others have undertaken on the
economics of happiness. I have worked in this field for a number of years and am
impressed by the stability of results obtained from analysing individual’s responses to
questions about levels of happiness or life satisfaction. Considering the theme of this
lecture, I will also look at the differences and similarities across European countries in
preferences between inflation and unemployment.
As part of its remit, the Monetary Policy Committee is responsible for achieving the
government’s target rate for inflation. I am pleased to say that both inflation and
unemployment have fallen in recent years, but individuals seem to have rather
different preferences over unemployment and inflation.
Happiness equations estimated in one EU country look much like those estimated in
all others. There are once again more similarities than differences and here is the
third major empirical similarity. In every EU country happiness is highest for those

9

who are married compared with those who are single, higher among the more
educated and those in work. Conversely, happiness is especially low for the
unemployed, those who are divorced, widowed or separated and the least educated.
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004, 2007a, b). Money does buy happiness but it takes a
lot to compensate for life events. It also turns out that individuals and countries with
high levels of happiness have lower levels of hypertension (Blanchflower and
Oswald, 2007a; Mojon­Azzi and Sousa­Poza, 2007).
Interestingly, happiness is U­shaped in age and minimises in the mid to late forties
across most EU countries. On average happiness minimised at age 47 in the EU and
age 45 in the USA and 46 for the world (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2007b)!

There is also evidence that individual happiness is correlated with macro variables. In
the raw data, life satisfaction is negatively correlated with the unemployment rate
(Chart 12) and with inflation (Chart 13). Previous work has shown that people are
happier when both inflation and unemployment are low (Di Tella et al, 2001; Wolfers,
2003). These previous studies also find that unemployment depresses well­being
more than does inflation. And it appears that life satisfaction is positively correlated
with higher GDP per capita too. When a nation is poor it appears that extra riches
raise happiness but has little impact in the richest countries. Inequality also lowers
happiness (Alesina et al, 2004).
I extend the area of research in the new paper to a wider sample of countries over a
longer time period. In my paper I make use of data at the individual level from
Eurobarometer surveys for a number of EU member countries, as well as Norway,
Croatia and Turkey for the period 1973­2006. In these surveys, individuals are asked,
“On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all
satisfied with the life you lead?”. In total, we have data on 680,000 individuals, and
for each of them we know their sex, age, employment status, marital status, education,
occupation etc., and we map in annual data on unemployment, inflation, GDP and the
interest rate for each country.

10

As with the previous literature, both inflation and unemployment enter significantly
negatively – higher unemployment and higher inflation both lower happiness. But
what do my estimates suggest about the relative size of the effects from the
unemployment rate and the inflation rate? Is the evidence consistent with the misery
index which weights unemployment and inflation equally?
My preferred aggregate equation gives coefficients on the effects of unemployment
and inflation of ­.0110 and –.0090 respectively, which represent the effect upon
wellbeing of a one percentage point change in each of the two independent variables.
Therefore, according to our estimate, a single­point rise in unemployment diminishes
life satisfaction by 0.0110 units, while a single­point rise in inflation leads to a 0.0090
reduction in units of life satisfaction. From these results it is possible to calculate the
slope of the indifference curve between inflation and unemployment. The issue here
is to measure the effects of a one percentage point change in unemployment compared
to a one percentage point change in unemployment – the so­called marginal rate of
substitution between unemployment and inflation.
To do this, however, it should be born in mind that the social cost of unemployment
contains both an aggregate and a personal component ­with an increase in the
unemployment rate, society as a whole becomes more fearful of unemployment and at
the same time some people actually lose their jobs. It is apparent from that the person
who actually becomes unemployed experiences a much larger cost, and is calculated
from the coefficient on being ‘unemployed’ in our estimation procedure. One needs
to add in the personal cost to the 1% of people who become unemployed.
I estimate the entire social well­being cost of a 1 percentage­point increase in the
unemployment rate as the sum of two components, which is .0110 + .0036= .0146.
This adds together the societal effect and the individual effect for the 1% of the
workforce directly impacted by the 1% increase in unemployment – the unemployed
themselves. To get the final result it is then necessary to divide .0146 by .0090. This
implies that across European countries the wellbeing cost of a 1 percentage point
increase in the unemployment rate equals the loss brought about by an extra 1.62
percentage points of inflation. The so­called 'misery' index, which simply sums the
unemployment rate with the inflation rate then understates the importance of
unemployment. In aggregate, society would prefer a reduction in unemployment over
a reduction in inflation. Please note that I’m not advocating any change to the Bank’s
legislated goals here, just stating an empirical observation!
It is also possible to obtain estimates for sub­groups. I find that females have a
similar trade­off to males (1.61 and 1.58 respectively). The least educated and the old
are more concerned about unemployment – the put the highest weight on
unemployment. Conversely, the young and the most educated and those still studying
put the greatest weight on inflation. This runs counter to the idea that older people
care more about inflation as they are more likely to have experienced it during their
adult lives. The results are also consistent with this finding when the analysis is done
by cohorts defined by year of birth. Older cohorts care more about unemployment
than younger cohorts. I estimate the trade­off for the UK at 1.92.

11

It is perfectly feasible, though, that an individual who experienced high inflation, and
especially hyper­inflation, during their adult lifetime would be more concerned about
the consequences of higher inflation than somebody who had, say, only experienced
low and stable inflation. To isolate any such effects I mapped onto the data file a
variable representing the highest annual inflation rate an individual had experienced
in their adult lifetime. I find that an individual who has experienced high inflation in
the past has lower happiness today, even holding constant today’s inflation and
unemployment rates. Inflation has its greatest impact when it is high and such effects
remain through time. This is especially the case in Austria and Germany where
inflation rates of over 1000% had been experienced by some in our surveys during
their adult lives.
I shall leave the analysis there. I have shown that there are a number of similarities
between European labour markets – indeed there seem to be many more similarities
than differences. Contrary to the received wisdom, the differences do not appear to be
attributable to labour market institutions: a more plausible explanation appears to be
that poor labour market performance is due to rigidities in product, capital and
housing markets: the labour market follows. Thank you for your attention. I am
happy to take questions although not on Northern Rock!
