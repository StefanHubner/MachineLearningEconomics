Speech by

MERVYN KING
GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND

at the University of Exeter

on Tuesday 19 January 2010

Some dates are easier to remember than others. 1789 and the French Revolution, 1989
and the fall of the Berlin Wall, 1929 and the Wall Street Crash are easily recalled. How
will 2009 be remembered: as the year when the world economy fell off a cliff but was
rescued by government and central bank intervention around the world? Or the year
when we finally recognised that genuine reform to the international monetary and
banking system was essential to restore prosperity? Time will tell.

The world economy is now coming out of recession. But the cost of the banking crisis
has been high. After an unprecedented period of sustained growth, total output in the
United Kingdom has now fallen for six consecutive quarters. It contracted last year by
around 5%, the largest fall in output since 1931. National income is around 10% below
the level it would have reached in the absence of the financial crisis.

Around the world, governments and central banks put a massive sticking plaster on the
wounds in the form of an extraordinary degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus. As a
result, business confidence, orders and output, which all collapsed at the end of 2008, are
gradually recovering.

But there is a long period of healing ahead. Although quarterly growth rates of GDP may
soon turn positive in the United Kingdom, unemployment is likely to remain high.
Fortunately, it has not increased to the 10% rate now experienced in both the United
States and the euro area. But at just under 8%, it is markedly above the level to which we
had become accustomed during the period known as the “Great Stability”.

The sharp monetary squeeze resulting from the efforts by banks to contract their balance
sheets is still casting a shadow over the future path of output and employment. Over the
past year, broad money growth has slowed sharply to a virtual standstill in the United
States, and it turned slightly negative in the euro area. In normal circumstances, we
might expect annual rates of increase of between 5% and 10%. At home, annual broad
money growth has slowed somewhat less sharply, and remains positive. The
unprecedented actions of the Monetary Policy Committee to inject £200 billion directly

2

into the economy – described by some as “quantitative easing” – have averted a
potentially disastrous monetary squeeze.

The headline in the Racing Post of 29 December said it all: “Quantitativeasing Maintains
Perfect Record”. Its Newbury correspondent reported that “Quantitativeasing started as a
red-hot favourite and had little trouble maintaining his unbeaten record. Ridden with
plenty of confidence his task was made easier when Tail of the Bank came to grief at the
second last. His trainer said ‘I was delighted with the way he went through that testing
ground’”. Rather like the MPC, the owners of Quantitativeasing, winner of all three of
his races in 2009, have yet to decide how many outings he will have in 2010. They are
waiting for race conditions to become clearer.

The bold action, taken both at home and abroad, helped to end the collapse in confidence
and spending last year. But equally bold action will be needed to prevent a similar crisis
from recurring. The origins of the crisis lay in our inability to cope with the
consequences of the entry into the world trading system of countries such as China, India,
and the former Soviet empire – in a word, globalisation. The benefits in terms of trade
were visible; the costs of the implied capital flows were not.

The new entrants adopted a strategy of expanding manufactured exports to create
employment. High rates of saving depressed domestic demand. So substantial trade
surpluses were required to keep total demand in line with supply. Equally, the countries
importing those manufactured goods ran trade deficits and required low saving rates to
maintain balance in their economies. Everyone seemed to gain. High-saving countries
created employment, and low-saving countries enjoyed faster consumption growth as
cheap imports meant that living standards rose by more than the increase in production –
worth around half a percentage point a year in the United Kingdom. These were the
benefits of greater trade.

But the pattern of poor countries saving a lot and rich countries borrowing was not
sustainable. The consequences of our inability to cope with these capital flows did not show

3

up in the usual macroeconomic indicators such as growth, unemployment and inflation.
Overall balance in each of the major economies was maintained. Rather, the massive flows
of capital from the new entrants into western financial markets pushed down interest rates
and encouraged risk-taking on an extraordinary scale. Banks expanded their balance sheets
and new instruments were created to satisfy the search for yield. In the five years up to 2007,
the balance sheets of the largest UK banks nearly trebled. The build up of risk came to
threaten the stability of the entire financial system. Capital flows provided the fuel which the
developed world’s inadequately designed and regulated financial system then ignited to
produce a firestorm that engulfed us all.

To prevent another crisis will require reform to both the regulation and structure of banking
and the international monetary system. I have spoken about the former on earlier occasions.
Tonight I want to focus on the question of how we can reduce the imbalances in the world
economy.

Although overall growth in both high and low saving countries was sustainable, the
composition of that growth was not. And the composition of growth reflects the
interaction between countries’ economic policy choices. No individual country faced
strong incentives to alter its own choices, but the collective outcome was costly to
everyone.

The interdependencies between countries can be illustrated by a simple three by three
table which I call “Sudoku for economists”, showing the composition of demand in, and
the trade flows between, the high- and low-saving groups of countries.

The key point is that the entries in the table – corresponding to economic policy choices –
are interdependent reflecting economic constraints. Total demand or GDP is the sum of
domestic demand and net trade. And, assuming for simplicity that the world can be
divided into high- and low-saving countries, the trade surplus of one group is the deficit
of the other. Just as in a sudoku puzzle, the nine numbers in the table cannot be chosen
independently. Sudoku for economists is simpler than ordinary sudoku because the
economic adding-up constraints mean that of the nine numbers in the table, only three can
be chosen independently. So, for example, if both groups of countries want to achieve
full employment levels of GDP, and the high-saving group targets a trade surplus, the
low-saving group cannot target a reduction in its trade deficit. Either trade deficits must
remain high, which is not likely to prove sustainable, or something else must give. That
might involve a recession in the deficit countries, or an acceptance by the surplus
countries that, one way or another, trade imbalances must be reduced. Sudoku for
economists shows that countries cannot pursue for long incompatible economic policy
frameworks.

5

The reason why continuing large deficits are not sustainable indefinitely is that for every
current account deficit there is an equal net capital flow in the opposite direction. Even if
those flows remain constant in size, they imply an ever increasing stock of international
asset and liability positions. Today China alone has reserves of over two trillion dollars,
and Japan another trillion dollars. Adding inexorably to the stock of international assets
and liabilities is like adding one brick on top of another to form a tower. With skill, it can
be done for a surprisingly long time. But eventually the moment comes when adding one
more causes the tower to fall down. If countries do not work together to reduce the “too
high to last” imbalances, a crisis of one sort or another in financial markets is only too
likely. We saw that following the first oil crisis in the 1970s when the attempt to “recycle
petrodollars”, as they were called, led to defaults by a number of emerging market
economies and a crisis in western banks. And sudden shifts in capital flows have led to
periods of remarkable volatility in exchange rates between the world’s major currencies,
the dollar, yen and euro (and, before 1999, the deutschmark).

So the problem of global imbalances is hardly new. It was behind many of the currency
crises in the post-war period and exercised the participants at the Bretton Woods
conference in 1944. And for the past decade it was a regular item on the agenda of
international meetings of finance officials at the IMF, G7 and elsewhere. But the
incompatibility of different countries’ policy frameworks has proved difficult to resolve.

At the Bretton Woods Conference, the British economist John Maynard Keynes
identified the asymmetry of the obligations placed on surplus and deficit countries as the
main source of the problem. He had argued that,

“the process of adjustment is compulsory for the debtor and voluntary for the creditor. If
the creditor does not choose to make, or allow, his share of the adjustment, he suffers no
inconvenience. For whilst a country’s reserve cannot fall below zero, there is no ceiling
which sets an upper limit.”

6

Both the British and the Americans put forward proposals for a system with more
symmetric obligations – but without success. For most of the post-war period, the
obligations on debtor countries, asymmetric though they may have been, prevented the
imbalances from becoming too big. More recently, the fact that the largest deficit
country, the United States, was the issuer of the world’s reserve currency allowed the
imbalances to continue for a long period, inducing a sense of complacency and
threatening the stability of the global economy.
So the challenge of designing an international monetary system that could prevent the
emergence of “too high to last” imbalances remains. The financial crisis has reminded us
all of the importance of solving this problem. Sudoku for economists shows that it is
essentially a political and not a technical problem: how can we ensure that the economic
policy frameworks of countries are consistent with each other?

At present there is no political mechanism for achieving that consistency. Finding such a
mechanism is urgent. Having narrowed somewhat at the height of the crisis, the
imbalances are now widening again. There is a risk that countries will, out of frustration,
impose unilateral and ultimately self-defeating protectionist responses. Because the
number of countries involved in the international trading system is now so large, and the
countries so diverse, the idea of another Bretton Woods conference is wholly impractical.
The IMF, despite the legitimacy bestowed by its membership of 186 countries, is too
unwieldy without reform. The G7 omits some of the key players, such as China. Of
more immediate promise is the G20 group of countries, which produces almost 90% of
world GDP. Last year, under the UK Presidency, the G20 agreed to a new policy
coordination framework which commits member countries to a process, using the
expertise of the IMF, of assessing the consistency of their national policies. G20 Heads
of Government will meet twice this year, in June and November, to discuss progress.

So far the only specific agreement is to talk to each other. Concrete steps to reduce the
scale of global imbalances have, to date, been notable by their absence. Smiling family
photographs marking the attendance at international gatherings are no substitute for

7

specific actions. Still, the G20 has laid its reputation on the line. It will be damaged if
the framework comes to nought.

Looking further ahead, the legitimacy and leadership of the G20 would be enhanced if it
were seen as representing views of other countries too. That could be achieved if the G20
were to metamorphose into a Governing Council for the IMF, and at the same time
acquire a procedure for voting on decisions.

The economic message from the crisis is clear: low-saving countries will reduce their net
borrowing from abroad and so will no longer be able to play the role of consumer of last
resort. To maintain levels of economic activity, high-saving countries must expand
domestic demand and allow their trade surpluses to shrink. This is easier said than done.
It will require changes in prices and most obviously in real exchange rates – via either
nominal exchange rates or domestic price levels. In themselves, proposals such as the
creation of a new reserve currency do not solve the inconsistency puzzle unless they alter
the desire of high-saving countries to run imbalances that are too high to last. But the
reason for hope, even if it has not yet triumphed over experience, is that, despite the
short-term political considerations that have prevented adjustment so far, the lesson of
Sudoku for economists is that cooperation is better than conflict. There are potential
gains for all in the longer term. That is why the UK Government put so much effort into
the G20 process. It is, as they say, the only game in town.

Working with our international partners will be important if we are to achieve reforms to
the international monetary system. But, as one of the low-saving group of countries, we
must not neglect the need for domestic policy actions. The need for a rebalancing of our
economy has been apparent for some time; I spoke about it in a speech just along the
coast in Plymouth ten years ago. The proportion of our domestic output that we save has
fallen by around a third over the past decade, as the share of consumption, especially
public consumption, has risen sharply. Looking ahead, monetary and fiscal policy
together must help to bring about a switch of demand from private and public
consumption to net exports and business investment as the recovery takes hold.

A key element in raising the national saving rate is the elimination over time of the
structural deficit in the public finances. Of course, there is a perfectly sensible debate
about the appropriate timing of the withdrawal of the temporary fiscal stimulus as the
economy recovers. Some has in fact already been withdrawn with the return of the
standard rate of VAT to 17.5% at the beginning of the month. But uncertainty about how
and when fiscal policy will respond has a direct bearing on monetary policy. And
markets can be unforgiving. As Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke said recently about
the similar fiscal position in the United States, “near-term challenges must not be allowed
to hinder timely consideration of the steps needed to address fiscal imbalances. Unless
we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will
have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth”. The Chancellor has made
clear that the Spring Budget provides the opportunity to do precisely that.

Over the past year, the UK economy has battled against the headwinds of an intense
monetary squeeze and a sharp fall in world trade, supported by the tailwinds of a huge
policy stimulus and a lower exchange rate. At this very early stage of the recovery, it is
particularly difficult to judge the medium-term prospects for the economy. Ten years
ago, I described how movements in macroeconomic data can sometimes bear a
“resemblance to old-fashioned disco dancing – sharp movements in unpredictable
directions creating much excitement, accompanied by a good deal of noise”. Over the
next few months, the data are likely to be dancing particularly vigorously under the
influence of the reversal of the VAT cut, a turnaround in the stock cycle and even the
effects of the recent cold weather. Added to that, the MPC is acutely aware that initial
data releases are often later heavily revised, and there is uncertainty over the timing of
fiscal consolidation.

The patience of UK households is likely to be sorely tried over the next couple of years.
There is little scope for growth in real take-home pay, which may remain weak even as
output recovers. It is clear that inflation is likely to pick up markedly in the first half of
this year, a message reinforced by this morning’s news that CPI inflation reached 2.9% in

9

December. The continuing pass-through of the earlier significant depreciation of sterling,
while part of the necessary rebalancing of our economy, is offsetting to some extent the
downward pressure on inflation from the large amount of spare capacity. And the rise in
VAT back to 17.5% means that CPI inflation is likely to rise to over 3% for a while, or
even higher for even longer were energy prices or indirect taxes to increase further.
Although such price level effects do not constitute a continuing source of inflation, and
hence should be temporary, they remain in the official measure of inflation for a full year.
Provided monetary growth remains well under control – and remember that at present it
is undesirably low – inflation should return to target in the medium term. I hope you will
all remember that in both of the past two years inflation picked up as a result of
temporary price level factors and then fell back, as the MPC had predicted.

So how will 2009 be remembered? As I said at the outset, it is too early to tell. The full
impact of the financial crisis has yet to be seen. And the national statisticians will take
another two years or so before providing their best estimates of spending and output in
the UK economy. More importantly, the question of whether basic reforms to the
structure of banking and the international monetary system will be made before another
crisis engulfs the world economy remains unanswered.
