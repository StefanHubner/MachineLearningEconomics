The nature of climate risk: physical and transition risks
Climate-related risks are twofold…
Physical

• The frequency of natural disasters
is increasing
• Insured losses regularly exceed
budgetary expectations
• A future 1-in-100yr loss may
exceed today’s 1-in-1000yr loss

Transition

• Additional risks are created by the
transition to a low-carbon economy
• These risks may appear as asset
devaluation, changes in energy
prices or an increased risk of
climate legal liability

How should insurers respond? Insurance business models

With global assets
under management of
more than $13 trillion ,
and premiums of $6.3
trillion, the insurance
sector has a substantial
and unique role to play

Whether through the
lens of natural
catastrophe (General
Insurers) or longevity
(Life Insurers), the long
and short-term aspects
of insurance business are
suited the nature of
climate-related risks

In light of this, much
of the PRA’s work on
climate change began
with Insurance,
including our first
adaptation report,
published 2015

Conclusion: Climate change is likely to occur…

Over an
extensive
timeframe

In multiple
geographies

With some
effects
crystallising
over decades

Insurers have the
opportunity to
help mitigate the
worst of these
impacts for
policyholders and
wider society
