return of around 9%. Now, it seems, the payback
period has shortened to around four years, a
required net rate of return of 14%1.

This is hardly a large sample. And it’s quite possible that managers’ opinions about hurdle rates aren’t worth
much anyway. Perhaps finance directors know that managers tend to over-estimate profitability and adjust
their targets accordingly.
But, for what it’s worth, these numbers are in the range of average returns on existing capital for
non-financial firms (Chart 1 again). More importantly – because this isn’t just anecdotal – you also get the
impression of an unusually wide spread between risky and risk-free yields from securities markets. The
green line in Chart 2 is the ratio of profits to assets, the latter valued at market prices, for UK-quoted
companies2. Instead of declining, that measure of yield has actually gone up since the recession, and even
in absolute terms (let alone relative to risk-free rates) is currently more than 100bp higher than it was during
the three years leading up to the crisis. The overall cost of capital in securities markets is this rate plus the
expected long-run growth rate of corporate earnings. We don’t have data for these expectations, but if,
instead, we use Consensus forecasts for long-run UK GDP growth, we get the dotted red line3.

I’ve assume a depreciation rate of 6.5%, in line with national accounts estimates for the non-financial sector.
Profits are net of taxes and depreciation, the denominator is equity and debt valued at market prices. Under Modigliani and Miller
(1958) this is the same as the return on unlevered equity.

This probably understates the true marginal cost. A part of UK-quoted companies’ earnings come from emerging economies, whose
expected growth is faster than that of the UK economy. In addition, new issuance tends to occur at a discount to existing securities.
Recently, according to data from Dealogic, this discount has ranged between 5%-10%.

One thing that has probably helped to push up required returns is a contraction in the supply of credit. Like
Bank rate, interest rates on new bank loans have declined (Chart 3). But this ignores the impact of non-price
factors, including outright rationing of loans. As we shall see below, this implies that the true, effective cost
of credit is materially higher than the quoted interest rate on new lending.
That said, what’s striking about Chart 2 is that the companies to which it applies are not, by definition,
restricted to raising money from banks. They can also sell securities. Yet their cost of finance has
apparently risen as well.
What I will suggest in this speech, therefore, is that, even if the origins of our present predicament lie in the
banking crisis of 2008, and in the subsequent need to repair banks’ balance sheets, we are now suffering
from a more general rise in the premium demanded for all risky investments, however they’re financed.
In fact, I will argue, the pattern in Chart 2 is exactly what you’d expect if investors’ fears about downside risks
in particular began to intensify – if their impression of “the worst that could happen” gets that much worse
(what I have in mind here is the possibility of extreme outcomes in the euro area). And the investments most
vulnerable to such a shift – where you’d expect to find the sharpest increase in required returns – are those
that have some element of irreversibility. This will include many projects (spending on intangibles, for
example) that are necessary to improve productivity. Thus high risk premia may be inhibiting not just
demand but the economy’s supply capacity as well.

Here’s the plan: I will start with some remarks about credit rationing, providing some evidence that bank debt
is more expensive than interest rates alone would imply; we then turn to a simple model of asset pricing that
allows for “rare disasters” – as we shall see, small increases in the perceived likelihood of extreme outcomes
can have powerful effects on yields, even if they’re still very unlikely to occur; I will then explain why these
effects are amplified in the case of sunk-cost projects and why, therefore, these downside risks may be
important for productivity.
Credit rationing
If the quoted interest rate were the true marginal price of debt, then the credit supply curve facing an
individual borrower would be a flat line (“S” in Chart 4). It would then make sense to carry out all investment
projects – ranked according to prospective return along the “D” line – until the marginal project that yields the
same as this interest rate.
Last week, however, my morning newspaper carried an interesting report. It said that a promise by a newly
launched supermarket bank to undercut rivals’ loan deals had been criticised by a watchdog “because it
could damage borrowers’ credit ratings”. The reason given was that lenders consider the number of loan
applications as an indicator of individual credit risk. So an additional application could increase the cost of
other debts, now or in the future. And instead of the low, flat supply curve in Chart 4, the individual borrower
apparently faces a higher, upward sloping line (Sc).
I have heard similar things from some businesses4. Their banks may be happy to roll over existing loan
deals at relatively low interest rates, but only – so these managers believe – if the company’s financial health
is maintained. This might mean keeping debt within certain limits. It might mean holding some minimum
amount of cash. But the effect is the same: credit supply for new investments is harder to come by and the
true marginal cost of debt – the amount firms are actually willing to pay in order to reduce it – is higher than
the interest rate.
Note that, facing such a curve, borrowers would have an incentive to cut spending – possibly to levels below
their current income – in order to repair balance sheets. Indeed they might effectively be forced to do so. So
if the cost line shifts upwards (to Sc’) as depicted in the Chart 4 – a crude characterisation of what a credit
tightening entails – you’d expect to see weaker investment, a higher rate of return on marginal projects and
larger surpluses in the non-financial economy.

4

The newspaper story also brings to mind exactly the sort of asymmetric-information world, as described originally by Stiglitz and Weiss
(1981), in which credit rationing can occur, i.e. in which the supply curve in Chart 4 becomes vertical at some point. The business-cycle
implications of these asymmetric information problems in debt contracts are explored by Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and by Kiyotaki
and Moore (1997).

We are all aware of the complaints from small business about the availability of credit. There are also clear
signs of rationing in mortgage markets. Chart 5 shows the balance on New Buyer Enquiries in the RICS
housing-market survey, an indicator of the desire to move house (and the associated demand for mortgage
debt) against the number of transactions three quarters later. Until the crisis, the RICS balance predicted
pretty well movements in both mortgage approvals and the number of transactions: activity in the housing
market looked to be demand driven. That relationship broke down decisively after 2008, however. Buyer
interest rose sharply towards the end of that year, as quoted mortgage interest began to fall. But activity
went in the opposite direction, to levels consistent with average tenure times well over 20 years. This
suggests that the market was – and continues to be – constrained not by a lack of demand but a contraction
in the supply of finance.
This evidence tells us there is rationing, but not what it’s worth in interest-rate terms (i.e. the rate rationed
borrowers would actually be prepared to pay for debt). But the behaviour of larger firms, most of which have
the option of selling bonds and equities, and are not limited to bank debt, suggests the effect is material.
Chart 6 plots the proportion of their external finance accounted for by securities issuance as opposed to new
loans from banks. The red line plots the difference in their cost (the gap between the earnings yield and
quoted interest rates). It’s drawn on an inverted scale, so a drop means bank debt is, on the face of it,
getting relatively cheaper. All else equal, you would expect that to encourage a shift towards bank finance
and, more generally, the two lines to move together over time.
That looks roughly true prior to the financial crisis. But it’s clearly not the case since: despite the steep fall in
interest rates, both in absolute terms and, to a greater extent, relative to yields on other forms of finance,
firms have been shifting away from bank debt (you can see this too in the data for the aggregate
non-financial corporate sector in Chart 7). If firms that have the option are choosing to pay down bank debt
by issuing securities that are, apparently, much more expensive, this indicates that the interest rate

Risk premia and “rare disasters”
One should hardly be surprised, after a once-in-a-century banking crisis, to observe shortages of credit.
Whether they’re sufficient to explain the continuing weakness of output and private-sector productivity growth
is another question, however.
One of the things that struck me about the companies reporting higher hurdle rates is that only a minority
also said they had problems with meeting banking obligations.
More significantly, we know that most business investment is done by large firms, companies that are
generally able (if they so choose) to issue securities and bypass the banking system. Yet that category of
spending also fell very sharply after the crisis. And, as we’ve already seen, even if those firms were indeed
substituting securities finance for bank debt, they were doing so at a significantly higher cost than before the
downturn – this despite a sharp fall in risk-free interest rates.
All this suggests that, even if the crisis originated in the banking system there is now a higher hurdle for risky
investment – including, or even especially (I will later argue) the sorts of projects needed to improve
productivity – on a more general basis. Specifically, what seems to fit best the facts in Chart 2 is not some
symmetric, two-sided increase in risk but a rise in the perceived probability of an extremely bad economic
outcome.

To illustrate the point I’ve used the simple model developed by the economist Robert Barro in his work on
“rare disasters”5. That work – itself inspired by an older idea by Rietz (1988) – was designed to account for
two stylised facts that more basic asset-pricing models have found hard to explain: why it is that risky assets
have yielded so much more, over time, than risk-free debt, and why risk-free rates are themselves so low6.
The Barro/Rietz insight is that you can resolve both puzzles if you allow for a big downside skew in the
distribution of output, and that the world is indeed characterised by such “rare disasters”. The possibility of
such outcomes significantly increases the insurance value of risk-free assets (instruments that pay out come
what may) so lowering their average yield. At the same time, it raises the required return on risky assets.
Not surprisingly these effects become more apparent as the perceived likelihood of a (still) rare disaster goes
up. Chart 8(a) simulates such an increase. It assumes that the “disaster”, were it to occur, is big enough to
reduce GDP by an average of 15%7 and that the probability of its occurring is initially thought to be 10%.
These numbers are somewhat arbitrary and you get similar results if you were to assume a slightly higher
initial probability but a smaller hit to GDP. The point of the simulation is that, from whatever starting level,
the perceived likelihood of an extreme, discrete outcome need only rise a little to have significant effects on
markets. As simulated here, a rise of 5% points or so in the perceived likelihood is sufficient to push risk-free
interest rates below zero while at the same time increasing the expected return on equity (i.e. the hurdle rate
for risky investments). To my mind, Chart 8(a) resembles quite closely the pattern of yields we’ve actually
seen in financial markets in recent years.
In principle, there are other ways you could account for this pattern, Lower expectations of long-run growth,
partly via the response of easier monetary policy, will have reduced yields on all assets. Higher uncertainty
(of the conventional, two-sided sort) would raise the risk premium.
But it’s hard to see how these effects can be big enough to explain the data. Judging by the sensitivity in
Chart 8(b), long-run growth expectations would have to have dropped several percentage points for that
alone to account for the decline in risk-free interest rates. Yet, as measured by consensus forecasts for
10-year-ahead GDP, those long-run expectations have declined only slightly (Chart 9). Similarly, the rises in
pure (two-sided) uncertainty you need to account for the actual widening in the risk premium look implausibly
large (Chart 8(c)) – 8% points or more, compared with a standard deviation of actual GDP growth that, in the
long run of historical data (Chart 10), has never got close to that8.

The impact of the “disaster” is itself stochastic, assumed to be uniformly distributed on [5%,25%]
8
Pure unpredictability – the expected size of forecast errors – is likely to be smaller (and cannot be bigger than) the standard deviation
of output itself as optimal forecasts will probably entail more than simply predicting that the economy will every year grow in line with its
long-run average. That said, it should also be recognised that in this model, the only source of uncertainty, apart from the possibility of
rare disasters, concerns purely temporary disturbances to the rate of growth. Bonsal and Yaron (2004) show that introducing very
persistent shocks to output growth can help explain the equity risk premium, though to do that their model needs a great deal of
persistence in shocks to growth and also the assistance of a very high degree of risk aversion.

So it looks to me as though a higher downward-skew in the distribution of outcomes – a higher risk of a rare
but very bad economic shock – does the better job of explaining how financial markets have behaved. And
we have, in the shape of the on-going financial crisis and the possibility of serious disruption in the euro
area, a very plausible candidate for such a risk.

That is not to say we know either what form the worst-case outcome would take, or what probability to attach
to it. I’m not sure it’s even knowable. That’s why the MPC decided last autumn explicitly to exclude these
risks from its fancharts. But there is less doubt that it could have serious implications for the UK or that it’s
already come to have a very significant impact on financial markets. Chart 11 plots the rolling correlation

Disaster risk and irreversible investment
I want to make two other points.
The first is brief and involves the distinction between credit supply and credit demand. What I’ve argued so
far is that, although UK bank deleveraging remains important – it’s still adding to financing costs for
borrowers dependent on the banks – the evidence suggests that an independent hurdle has emerged in the
form of higher risk premia, plausibly associated with events in the euro area. This is raising the bar for all
investments, including those financed in securities markets.
Were the worst outcomes to occur, however, they would clearly be transmitted via, and amplified by, the
banking system. UK banks have significant exposure to the rest of Europe9. And, like those for the wider
market, banks’ funding costs have become much more sensitive to movements in euro-area sovereign
spreads. This suggests that pressures on UK banks emanate partly from precisely the same risks that are
affecting non-financial companies. This makes it harder to distinguish the influences of “credit supply” and
“credit demand”.

The second point concerns the distinction between reversible and irreversible investments. The model
simulations above applied to the first, investments that a firm could exit costlessly. If it involved physical
plant, for example, then the assumption would be that firms could lease such equipment or re-sell it in
second-hand markets. In reality, many investments are not like that: they involve sunk costs. Big FDI
projects, in-firm training, R&D, the adoption of new technologies, even simple managerial reorganisations –
these are all things that can improve productivity but have risky returns and cannot be easily reversed after
the event.
This matters because economists have long recognised that sunk-cost investments are particularly
vulnerable to increases in uncertainty, fears of bad outcomes in particular. If things turn out well, you can
always go ahead with the project when they do so; but if things turn out badly, a sunk-cost investment will
have proved a big mistake. So if the risk of a rare but very bad event grows – if the worst-case scenario
suddenly looks that much worse – you have a powerful incentive to delay such projects: the “option value” of
waiting goes up and the required rate of return along with it10. Thus the equivalent to Chart 8(a), which
plotted the sensitivity of expected returns to “disaster” risk, would look like Chart 12, and the effects of such
risks on risky investment is thereby amplified.
How important is this effect? Many intangible investments are, by their nature, hard to measure, and not
included in conventional statistics on business investment. But Marrano and Haskel (2006) estimated that, in
2004, and at least in gross terms11, they were the same size, both worth 11% of GDP. And while not all
intangible investment is irreversible, one suspects that, with a scarcer supply of leasing finance (Chart 13),
even some physical investments are harder to exit than before the crisis.

The canonical reference is Dixit and Pindyck (1994)..
Intangible capital is likely to depreciate faster and is therefore probably smaller than measured business investment in net terms.

Summary and conclusion: euro risk still a hurdle to recovery
In a speech last year, I suggested that low capital mobility had contributed to weak growth of productivity and
output. Following big shifts in relative prices, most obviously between traded and non-traded output, it was
likely that some activities had become much more profitable (all else equal), others less so. Failure to move
resources from one to the other would lower aggregate productivity. I also suggested that low capital mobility
was connected with deleveraging: banks were “forbearing” on existing finance for activities that had become
unprofitable while failing to fund the newly profitable projects.
But the truth is that, although there are still signs of tight credit, finance looks expensive even for firms that
can bypass the banks. Together with the big drop in risk-free interest rates this suggests that the distribution
of economic outcomes driving financial markets has a marked downwards skew – that fears have increased
of a rare but bad economic outcome. Such an event could remain very unlikely yet, if severe enough, still
have a powerfully inhibiting effect on new investment projects, particularly those that are difficult to exit. As
the May Inflation Report put it “the possibility of extreme outcomes crystallising [in the euro area] will
continue to weigh on UK activity...even if those outcomes do not actually occur” (my emphasis). What
I’m arguing in this piece is that these heightened fears may already have been affecting the growth of UK
activity, investment and productivity for some time.
It would be nice to think that these worries are unfounded – that “the only thing we should fear”, to quote
Roosevelt, “is fear itself”. Unfortunately, I doubt that’s the case. Markets and businesses possess “animal
spirits” and can over-react to events. They may have done so again. But there’s probably a premium on
risky investments because there is genuine economic risk.

I don’t mean, by any of this, to add to the prevailing gloom. We should remember that we have been through
similar episodes before – as recently as the mid-1970s, risk premia rose to levels that were probably higher
than they are now (I don’t think it’s a coincidence that productivity growth also slowed sharply at that time).
Equity prices are still higher than last summer’s lows, investment is still happening and, thanks in part to the
ECB’s LTRO operations, banks have managed to attract far more funding in the first few months of 2012
than they did a year ago.
In addition, one important implication of this thesis is that, if fears of downside risks were to recede, this
could have pretty powerful effects on output – potential as well as actual – in a positive direction12.
Nor is domestic policy powerless to affect things in the interim. Indeed, I strongly believe that the dramatic
easing in monetary policy after 2008, here and in other parts of the world, was crucial in helping to prevent
what might have been a much deeper downturn. And, were the (still unlikely) worst-case risks in the euro
area actually to be realised, then our own monetary policy would again play its part in mitigating the impact.
But, to some extent at least, that expectation is already there: markets should, and presumably do, know
that, because such a downturn would threaten to push inflation to dangerously low levels, it would also be
met with further monetary easing. To a degree, therefore, that response is already factored into market
yields and the prevailing cost of capital.
One should therefore recognise that, while they are both necessary and effective, these domestic
interventions have their limits. It remains the case that, for the time being at least, the most important policy
decisions affecting the UK are being taken in other parts of the continent.
.

12

Bernanke (1983a) points out that the arrival of bad news can actually have a cathartically positive effect on irreversible investments
(on the basis that people realise things can only better). Bloom (2009) simulates the effects of temporary uncertainty shocks on
investment and labour productivity when firms face fixed (and sunk) adjustment costs. His shocks are symmetric – more uncertainty
adds to upside and downside risks – but they nonetheless have powerful effects on investment and output. Equally, once uncertainty
