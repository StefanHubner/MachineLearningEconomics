Introduction
It is nearly three years since the FSB published its Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes
(KAs) and, as we look forward to the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, it is worth taking stock
of the progress that has been made to end Too Big to Fail.
In Europe we now have the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)1. Broadly speaking
this maps to the FSB Key Attributes: the BRRD establishes a comprehensive set of legal powers
and articulates the process through which recovery and resolution planning will take place to
ensure that firms develop and maintain effective recovery plans, and that the necessary actions
are taken to ensure that they are resolvable. And the objective is in line with the Key Attributes:
both view resolution in terms of ensuring the continuity of critical functions without recourse to
public funds.

So it will be a real step forward for us here in Europe when the BRRD is implemented. The
1 January 2015 deadline for doing so is fast approaching and all Member States are working hard
to revise their national laws and bank resolution frameworks by then.

Given this progress, I propose to talk about what a resolution transaction looks like in practice
before turning to some of the preconditions for resolution to be feasible and credible.

I will focus in particular on making liability structures compatible with resolution. The FSB was
asked by G20 leaders to prepare, by the time of the Brisbane summit, proposals on the adequacy
of global systemically important banks’ (G-SIBs) loss absorbing capacity when they fail. Such loss
absorbing capacity is sometimes referred to as “gone concern loss absorbing capacity”, or GLAC.
The equivalent provision in BRRD is the Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible
Liabilities, or MREL. In both contexts the concept is essentially the same: both GLAC and MREL
aim to ensure that banks have in place an adequate stock of liabilities that can be used to cover
losses and meet recapitalisation needs in a resolution.

I will concentrate my remarks on large international banking groups, or Global Systemically
Important Banks (G-SIBs) in the parlance of the FSB.

The BRRD applies to all credit institutions and certain investment firms. Member States will
therefore need to think through how MREL should apply to other firms.

But, crucially, EU G-SIBs are often active in third countries and non-EU firms have extensive EU
operations. This explains why the FSB’s proposals on GLAC are a crucial part of ending the
problem of Too Big to Fail and in effect internationalise the concept of MREL beyond the EU.

Resolution Transaction

The resolution of a G-SIB is likely to involve bail-in. Why do I say this, when we have other
resolution tools available? I say this because of the importance of protecting critical functions. It is
simply not credible to think that a G-SIB could be dismantled over a resolution weekend without a
destabilising disruption to critical functions. Finding a private sector purchaser capable of taking on
the business – in whole or in parts – is likely to be even more difficult.

Bail-in enables us to stabilise a firm. It buys the time that will allow for an orderly reorganisation or
wind down of all or part of a failing firm, in order to address the underlying cause of the failure.
There is more than one way to effect a bail-in: either through the use of write-down and conversion
powers directly, or via a bridge institution. In a bridge, liabilities are exposed to loss by leaving
them behind in an insolvency process with the activity that is to continue transferred to a new legal
entity. In contrast, where the bail-in tool is applied directly, liabilities are written down or converted
into equity within the existing legal entity.

Applying the bail-in tool directly has a number of advantages over the bridge approach, at least in
the context of a resolution at the level of an operating company. In particular, because no new
entity is required, it will not be necessary over a resolution weekend to authorise a new entity, or to
change the contract documentation to which the firm is a party, and memberships of Financial
Market Infrastructures can remain intact.

But, whichever approach is pursued, the essential elements of the transaction are the same.
These are set out in the KAs and are included in some detail in the BRRD:


Entry into resolution: The trigger for entry into resolution is twofold2: first, a firm must be failing,
or likely to fail to meet its conditions for authorisation; second, it must be reasonably likely that
no action is available to remedy this situation within a reasonable timeframe.

This is intentionally forward looking; it is designed to allow recovery actions to be taken to
remedy a breach, or likely breach, of threshold conditions, when the existing owners and
management of the firm can take actions that might be successful in rectifying the breach. But,
when recovery is not reasonably likely, resolution authorities have the option to put the firm into
resolution and deploy their toolkit. And the BRRD goes beyond this – it includes the obligation
that, when these two triggers are met, capital instruments are written down or converted to the
extent necessary to meet resolution objectives, putting in statute the Basel Committee’s
requirement that capital must be fully loss-absorbing when firms meet the point of non-viability.


Early termination: For resolution to work effectively, resolution authorities need to ensure that
counterparties do not use entry into resolution of a firm as grounds for closing out derivatives
and other contracts. Disorderly close out could generate exactly the adverse impact of failure
on the broader system that resolution is intended to avoid. For that reason, powers to apply a
stay on contract terminations and cross defaults are part of the Key Attributes. This power is
included in the BRRD, along with to apply a stay power in recognition so that resolution actions
taken by non-EU resolution authorities can be enforced within the EU. There are also
provisions in the BRRD that will give resolution authorities the power to impose requirements
that where EU firms are operating outside the EU, in the absence of a recognition power in the
host regime, their financial contracts include terms that ensure the actions of the home
resolution authority are enforceable3.



Bail-in: So to the bail-in where again the KAs and the BRRD are aligned4. The most important
thing to note here is that bail-in must respect the creditor hierarchy. Under BRRD, a small
number of liabilities are excluded from bail-in – for example those with an original maturity of
less than seven days, and in exceptional circumstances some additional liabilities may be
excluded – for example in order to maintain continuity in critical functions. But the principle is
clear that liabilities will be written down and converted according to the creditor hierarchy and,
within a given class, all affected creditors will be treated equally. Moreover, there is an explicit
safeguard that creditors shall be left no worse off following the application of the bail-in tool
than they would have been in insolvency. This enables resolution authorities to act with
sufficient speed and flexibility, whilst providing shareholders and creditors with an appropriate
degree of certainty as to how they will be treated.



Valuation: Determining the amount of write-down and conversion of debt required to
recapitalise a failed bank and calculating the counterfactual insolvency valuation for the no
creditor worse off test are at the heart of the bail-in. A series of valuations are therefore
required in the course of a resolution transaction, as the BRRD sets out in some detail5. First,
a “going concern” valuation of the firm’s assets and liabilities will be used to the gauge the size
of any bail-in that is required. A core purpose of this valuation is to quantify expected future
losses and so the recapitalisation need at the point of resolution. Second, an equity valuation
is needed to inform the terms of the exchange and the allocation of the net asset value
generated via the bail-in to the liability holders that have been written down or converted. And,
finally, a no creditor worse off valuation measures the counterfactual valuation of the firm in an
insolvency to ensure that shareholders or creditors are left no worse off than they would have
been in an insolvency. The EBA’s technical standards in this area will be a key determinant of
our approach to valuation.



Exchange: A desirable feature of resolution by bail-in, is to be able to transfer to those bond
holders subject to bail, any compensation they are due as soon as possible. Compensation
would take the form of the firm’s shares or other securities and the resolution would be
structured so as to deliver as quickly as possible to the relevant bond holders an interim
instrument which is tradeable but also facilitates the change of ownership that follows a bail-in
to meet the relevant regulatory requirements. To this end we have been working on
Certificates of Entitlement (CEs) which may provide a possible solution. CEs, issued by the
resolved bank, represent the contingent right to receive the firm’s shares as compensation.
Over the resolution weekend, trading and settlement of the firm’s bonds will be blocked and
CEs will be credited to the bondholders’ accounts in the clearing systems (through their
custodians). The bondholders, now CE holders, will have a beneficial interest in the ordinary
shares of the firm. Once the terms of the bail-in are finalised, conversion ratios for the CEs into
shares will be established and CE holders will be able to exercise their rights under the CEs
resulting in legal title and voting rights being transferred to those bailed in bondholders entitled
to compensation. In order to receive legal title and voting rights to the shares, the CE holders
are required to provide evidence of their underlying beneficial ownership of the bonds, confirm
that they are not acting as a controller and provide instructions for settlement. In this way
beneficial ownership of the bank in resolution will stay in the private sector throughout the
process.



Reorganisation: Finally, where a firm has been stabilised through a bail-in, this must be
accompanied by a comprehensive restructuring plan. Bail-in is – explicitly – a prelude to
reorganisation and the stability that it creates buys the time to achieve this6. How much time is
required will depend on the options available and how easily and quickly they may be
implemented but it is essential to address directly the causes of failure and to restore market
confidence so that the firm can access funding and operate normally. Part of the resolution
planning process with firms is discussion of the options available for reorganising critical
functions in a resolution, whether they are to continue within the firm, to be transferred
elsewhere in the market, or to be wound down. Authorities may require firms to make changes
ex ante in the way they are organised or operate in order to be adequately resolvable.
Structural reforms have been introduced in some jurisdictions to guarantee that options to
separate critical functions in resolution exist. The creation of ring-fenced banks in the UK is one
such example.

So what does all this tell us? First and foremost it tells us that failing firms are not being
resurrected in a bail-in. The reality of a G-SIB is that its activities cannot be shut down immediately
and it will need to be adequately recapitalised to sustain its critical functions and stabilise the
situation while a reorganisation or orderly wind-down takes place. In order to achieve this, firms
must have a liability structure that allows them to absorb losses and to restore solvency to the point
that a G-SIB can be reauthorised, and command market confidence and access to normal central
bank facilities following the resolution.

Loss absorbing capacity in resolution

That is what GLAC and MREL are meant to help achieve. If G-SIBs do not have adequate
loss-absorbing capacity when they fail, then the resolution authority may not be able to stabilise
them without recourse to public funds. This will mean the pernicious problem of ‘Too Big To Fail’
will remain unsolved, and the destructive link between banks and their sovereigns will not be
severed.

But what exactly does ‘adequate’ loss absorbency in resolution mean? That will depend on the size
and systemic importance of a firm; a very small bank with a few hundred depositors may not need
any loss-absorbing capacity as its critical functions may be limited to the insured deposits it
provides, which are covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS). Any cessation in service is
6

unlikely to cause financial instability– although, even in the case of the smallest banks, it is
important that insured depositors are able quickly to recover their funds via the DGS. But, as I
have already noted, given their size and complexity, it is important for G-SIBs that there is
adequate GLAC to allow the bank to be stabilised without disrupting its critical functions. This has
implications for the size, quality, location and disclosure of G-SIBs’ GLAC in G-SIBs.

Taking size first: in order that critical functions are not disrupted, prudential authorities around the
world must be able to permit the firm in resolution to continue to provide its critical functions (e.g.
deposit taking). This implies that, at a very minimum, there must be sufficient GLAC to restore
minimum capital requirements. Whatever backward-looking accounting may have indicated,
experience suggests there is usually little or no equity value left in a bank once it has failed. The
prudent, fair and realistic valuation that resolution authorities must conduct in resolution (as
required in the BRRD) will likely crystallise previously unrealised losses or expected losses on the
asset side of the bank’s balance sheet. This suggests that GLAC should at least be equivalent to
minimum Tier 1 capital requirements. It is likely to need a capital position at least as strong as
other banks in the market. And for a bank that has undergone resolution to command market
confidence, it is likely to need at least as much capital as other banks in the market. It would be
sensible therefore for G-SIBs to maintain sufficient GLAC to be able at least to restore fully
regulatory capital buffers above capital minima, in order to maintain market confidence that they
would be able to absorb any further losses during the restructuring phase without re-entering
resolution. One final point on quantum – the ability of stressed systemically important banks to
raise their capital position by shedding assets in short order is not sufficiently reliable to warrant a
lower GLAC requirement for G-SIBs.

So, we can see how much loss-absorbency we might need, but how much of what, exactly? In
principle, it should be possible to expose every unsecured, uninsured liability of a bank to loss in
resolution, just as would happen in insolvency. But, from experience, we know that some
uninsured, unsecured liabilities are not as reliably loss absorbing in resolution as others and, in
practice, it has been difficult to break into the senior class. In part this is due to an absence of
legal powers to facilitate this – and the BRRD addresses that problem. But in part it is because of
the potential adverse consequences of taking resolution action within a class which includes
liabilities that it is difficult to bail-in and where, although we have the power to exercise discretion in
exceptional circumstances, it is undesirable and legally risky to rely on this discretion. Just as we
require G-SIBs to maintain high-quality, long-dated capital instruments that can reliably absorb

losses in a going-concern in order to reduce the probability that they fail, so too we should require
G-SIBs to maintain high-quality, long-dated liabilities that can reliably absorb losses in a
gone-concern, in order to reduce the probability that they fail in a disorderly way.

So, which liabilities are sufficiently reliably loss absorbing in resolution to count towards a firm’s
GLAC? Well, any liability that meets the following conditions:


First, it must be sufficiently likely that the liability will actually be there when the firm enters
resolution. The BRRD requires that, in order to count toward MREL, liabilities must have a
residual maturity of at least 12 months.



Second, the liability must be within the scope of the relevant authority’s resolution tools.
That means that instruments issued under foreign law must contain explicit contractual
provisions to bring them within scope of the authority’s powers, unless there is explicit and
watertight statutory provision for this.



Third, the instrument must be easy to value in resolution, and operationally straight-forward
to expose to loss (and this is easier for debt than it is for deposits) without disrupting the
critical functions of the G-SIB. Otherwise it may not be possible to stabilise the firm quickly
whilst achieving the resolution objectives.



Fourth, exposing the liability to loss must not be likely to give rise to valid legal challenge or
‘No Creditor Worse Off’ compensation claims (NCWO) for breach of the NCWO creditor
safeguard.

There is a broad consensus amongst regulators and resolution authorities that capital instruments
and long-term, vanilla unsecured bonded debt meets all of the above conditions, subject to a
couple of caveats. One of the main ones being that if senior debt ranks alongside liabilities that
are less reliably loss absorbing, such as sight or other short-term deposits and derivatives, then
such debt cannot meet condition four above without bailing in instruments that fail condition three.
This is because if equally-ranking liabilities are not exposed to loss, and the resolution authority
departs from the creditor hierarchy, then the senior bond holders may have valid NCWO
compensation claims. This could put public funds at risk. Equally as importantly, the protection
afforded to senior bondholders by the NCWO compensation claim could mean that market
discipline is diluted. This issue is related to a topic I will return to; adequate disclosure of GLAC,

and the ability of creditors to be able to assess accurately their position in the creditor hierarchy
and the corresponding risk their exposures have.

But first, I would like to point out that requiring eligible instruments to rank below excluded liabilities
(such as derivatives), does not mean that G-SIBs will have to meet GLAC with traditional Tier 2
debt. There are various mechanisms available through which ‘senior’ bonded debt could remain
senior to traditional subordinated debt but junior to the general creditor class. For example, this
could be achieved via contractual provisions; as resolution authorities are empowered to require
for MREL in the BRRD. Another option is for G-SIBs to issue GLAC-eligible instruments from a
holding company and downstream the proceeds (often referred to as ‘structural subordination’).
Another option that has been suggested is either to prefer excluded liabilities or subordinate
eligible liabilities in statute – although agreeing changes to national insolvency laws could prove
challenging. Again, whatever the approach, adequate disclosure at the legal entity level will be
crucial to allow creditors to identify easily their position in the creditor hierarchy. With such
adequate disclosure, there is no a priori reason why the cost of meeting such a requirement would
differ between the approaches.

A final, crucial, aspect in rationalising G-SIBs’ liability structures to make them resolvable is to
ensure that the loss-absorbing capacity is issued from the right place in the group. G-SIBs have
hundreds, sometimes thousands, of legal entities. Applying resolution tools to each one is not
possible. Therefore the resolution strategy for each G-SIB will involve resolving either the whole
group, or parts of the group, by applying resolution tools to a single parent, or a small number of
intermediate parent entities – or, in FSB parlance, resolution entities which serve as the point or
points of entry to resolution. There must be mechanisms in place to ensure that key operating
subsidiaries of each resolution entity have reliable access to the GLAC issued by the resolution
entity. One way of achieving this is for the resolution entity to downstream the resources raised by
external issuance of GLAC-eligible instruments to material subsidiaries as long-term debt that
ranks junior to the subsidiaries’ non-capital instruments. This pre-positioned intragroup GLAC
could contain provisions that allow the losses to flow up to the resolution entity by converting the
intragroup debt to equity without placing the subsidiary into resolution, if home and host authorities
agree this is necessary. Since, in a cross-border resolution of a G-SIB, it is in the interests of both
home and host resolution authorities that key subsidiaries that are not themselves resolution
entities do not formally enter resolution, and instead resolution tools are applied only to resolution
entities, this will incentivise cooperation between home and host and reduce incentives to
ringfence assets locally in an uncooperative manner.

So, if there is sufficient GLAC of adequate quality that is distributed appropriately within G-SIB
groups, we will have made a further, major step in making G-SIBs resolvable and ending TBTF.
Again, let me emphasise the importance of disclosure at the legal entity level. It is important that
investors in GLAC, and creditors of G-SIBs generally, can identify their place in the creditor
hierarchy and therefore better estimate their expected losses should resolution become necessary.
This will reduce moral hazard, improve certainty of outcomes in the event of failure, and so
incentivise investors to ensure the firms they are investing in are run in a prudent manner.

Conclusion

I want to emphasise just how much progress has been made in last three years: resolution regimes
and authorities are now in place where there were none previously in many countries. Resolution
planning for systemic banks is taking place in Crisis Management Groups and will soon be taking
place in EU resolution colleges too. We look forward to the guidance and technical standards
from the European Banking Authority on how resolutions will be transacted. I think, in time, the EU
BRRD will come to be seen as one of the most significant pieces of banking legislation to emerge
from the financial crisis.

But we must finish the job. For effective resolution to be feasible (i.e. technically practicable) and
credible (i.e. widely understood and believable), firms need to be resolvable. MREL is central to
this. And for the world’s largest banks, for almost all of whom the EU is either home or host, it is
crucial that the FSB develops an internationally-agreed standard that establishes a common
framework, like MREL, outside Europe and ensures that G-SIBs have sufficient appropriately loss
absorbing capacity should they fail in order to be able to implement an orderly, effective resolution
of any firm and therefore end “Too Big to Fail”.
