might introduce potential vulnerabilities into parts of the
system.

of external market contacts

(a) Shading is based on a score that reflects, for unguaranteed debt, both issuance (relative to GDP) and spreads in primary markets and secondary
markets, expressed as a number of standard deviations from average, using as much data as was available from January 1998. Updated to end-May 2011;6
recent months use 2011 Q1 GDP.

Impact of the regulatory agenda
•

Financial crisis exposed weaknesses in regulatory regimes, and
triggered a wholesale overhaul.

•

Cornerstone of that is to solve the “too big to fail” problem.

•

Authorities, domestically and internationally, are still working on
the design and precise calibration of these regulations.

•

Getting those right will take time, but it is crucial. Meanwhile the
uncertainty is impacting on market functioning.

•

Once decided, there should be improvements arising from:
(a) more certainty, (b) a safer financial system.
