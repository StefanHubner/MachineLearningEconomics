What sort of world are we in?
• For foreign policy , the question facing an intervention
decision is whether this is Munich (deter) or Vietnam
(accommodate)?
• For monetary policy, the question is similar but reversed: is
this the 1930s (accommodate) or 1970s (deter)?
• The underlying dynamic today is parallel to the 1930s, but we
have avoided repeating
p
g that for several reasons:
– Structural changes (automatic stabilizers, flexible x/r, deposit
insurance)
– A smaller share of the world in synchronized contraction
– Aggressive coordinated macroeconomic stimulus 2008‐2010

• Is there a risk to go from such a state to one of overheating
and inflation ‐ or inflation
and contraction (aka stagflation)?

What sort of world are we in?
• Let’s
Let s assess what it took for stagflation to occur in the 1970s
• This is a serious question, not a straw man
– Stagflation
g
is unusual historically,
y, especially
p
y followingg a recession
– The historical and theoretical imagery of ‘pre‐emptive monetary
policy’ stems completely from the 1970s experience

• What would be involved in repeating the wage‐price spirals?
–

–

Unanchored inflation expectations
Transmission of expectations into real wage resistance
Economically significant energy supply shock(s)
An unrecognized

decline in trend productivity
p
y growth

• Only the third of these (oil) seems to possibly be at work
– Bruno and Sachs (1985), Blanchard and Gali (2007) show that all of
them have to interact to (re)produce the 1970s

Monetary policy that
anchors inflation expectations
• The theoretical literature on central banking (and
(
some press))
treats monetary policymaking as under constant suspicion
• The empirical evidence has not supported this view (Blinder,
(Blinder
McCallum, Posen on CBI; Kuttner and Posen on CB governors)
• Right
g now in gglobal markets, there is understandingg of explanations
p
– Recent Inflation Report and my February speech on financial expectations

• Several factors contribute to this real‐world anchoring:
– Central bank independence from fiscal authorities
– Better knowledge of how some (not all) of the economy works
– Inflation targeting
g
g and transparent
p
disclosure byy central banks

• A reasonable discourse and accountability, not a ‘trigger‐strategy’
game of needing to pre‐empt (fighting the last war?)

Labor markets with limited
bargaining power for workers over wages
Everyone in the UK should remember (or
( know)) about the 1970s, the
Winter of Discontent, Britain Against Itself (Beer (1982))…
– That was in part the result of 30 years of rising union power

• But that was then, this is now
•

Today, we are seeing the result of 30 years of declining union power

Labour market structures have changed in the UK and globally

Oil price trends not obviously

Oil matters for modern economies, but less than it did 30 yyears ago
g
• Is there a major supply shock, or an exaggerated response to one
given high demand?
• What is the elasticity of demand by consumers and businesses?
• How fast would/could there be a supply response to demand?

• The size of the trend and the ggood’s importance

• The size of the underlying trend versus the fluctuations around

IF the trend is big enough and reversals short
short‐enough
enough, we will respond
to keep inflation in line with the target (Bean (2011))
But, a majority of the MPC (and I agree) says not yet there

Oil price trends not obviously

Could we (I) be making the wrong call on energy prices? Yes.
There is a plausible story to be told regarding both supply and demand
th t we are allll going
that
i to
t cope with
ith ongoing
i price
i rises
i
iin energy

• But we rely on futures markets for our oil price forecast, and
those are only flat to slightly upward
• And no one seems to be stockpiling oil in the face of such
pressures
• And the price reversals seem to be pretty big and sustained
• So we are watching carefully,
carefully and will change assumptions as
warranted – but no change of assumption is warranted yet
(especially if a global slowdown diminishes energy demand)

There are good reasons to doubt the observed productivity data:

• There is no comparable international ‘technology

• GDP data tends to get revised up after recessions (particularly in
UK) and there is an obvious candidate in Net Export measures
• If there remain overemployed sectors, then productivity will rise

Not That ‘70’s Show:
Why Stagflation is Unlikely
We are in an economic situation in the UK today where:
• Monetary policy anchors inflation expectations
• Workers have limited bargaining power over wages
• Oil prices are not obviously accelerating one way
• Trend productivity growth is largely undiminished
Therefore little risk of inflation let alone stagflation
• But we still risk echoing that 30’s show writ small
