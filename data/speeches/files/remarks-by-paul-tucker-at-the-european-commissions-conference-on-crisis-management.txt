EUROPEAN COMMISSION CONFERENCE ON CRISIS MANAGEMENT:
19 MARCH 2010
RESOLUTION OF LARGE AND COMPLEX FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: THE BIG
ISSUES

I am delighted to be at today’s conference, the first major conference under Commissioner Barnier.

As many colleagues here will know, I chair the Financial Stability Board’s Working Group on
Cross-Border Crisis Management. But my remarks today are offered in a personal capacity, albeit
drawing on the international dialogue.

The conference is very well timed given the Commission’s work on a possible EU directive on
resolution regimes. An increasing number of national authorities have already established or are
prospectively establishing Special Resolution Regimes for the resolution of commercial banks,
enabling the transfer of deposits and good assets to another bank, with bad assets and other creditor
claims going into an insolvency process. At a high level of generality, a distressed bank is split into
a continuing good bank, typically acquired by a healthy bank; and a gone-concern bad bank, which
goes into administration. Insured deposits travel with the ‘good bank’. All other creditors typically
travel with the ‘bad bank’ and become claimants in the insolvency.

We can be confident that this will help to buttress stability. Encouragement from the EU to all
members states to establish such regimes would be really useful.

But we also know that, of itself, this is insufficient. It cannot cope with distressed LCFIs (‘large and
complex financial institutions’) without injections of public money.

In the first place, every country having its own Special Resolution Regime does not solve the
problem of resolving cross-border banking groups.

Second, such regimes cannot cope with investment banking, whether national or global, if a buyer
cannot be found. Even for a (hypothetical) LCFI operating entirely within a single jurisdiction, with
all of its counterparties, customers and contracts domiciled there, a standard resolution regime could
not effect an orderly run down of, for example, a massive, complex derivatives portfolio. Putting

2

over-the-counter derivatives though central counterparties would help. But it would not securely
solve the problem.

Today I want to surface those big issues, and to encourage the EU and the international community
more generally to explore possible solutions. In doing so, I take our objectives to be twofold:

(i)

First, to avoid a disorderly disruption to the provision of financial services to the economy
in the event of firm distress

(ii)

And second, to put market discipline back into the system, by having losses fall to
uninsured creditors as well as to equity holders, and without public sector solvency support.

Bluntly, the challenge is how to sustain the provision of financial services during a crisis without the
state bailing out uninsured creditors.

Handling LCFI complex derivative/trading portfolios

Some types of business activity, particularly complex trading, do not lend themselves at all well to
the standard resolution tools I summarised just now. Not least, unwinding a derivatives book is
especially complicated; it typically requires dynamic hedging to preserve value, and that would be
very hard indeed in a liquidation. Counterparties flee. Funding flees. The Lehman and AIG
experiences demonstrate this. So, in a different context, does the time it took Berkshire Hathaway to
wind down the complex derivatives portfolio of its Gen Re subsidiary; years, not months.

What can be done? One route, suggested by those examples, would be for the authorities to finance
the wind down of complex trading positions, in what would be in effect an analogue to US-style
debtor-in-possession financing. The authorities would be preferred creditors.

That kind of approach could be used either briefly, in order to bridge to an insolvency procedure,
which would amount to putting a framework around the kind of operation the NYFed mounted for a
week or so to contain disruption from the failure of Lehman’s US broker-dealer. Or, alternatively, it
could in principle be used over a prolonged period, to finance the run off of a whole book. In either
case, however, it would expose the authorities to risk of loss, and so would not always deliver the

3

Objectives I think we share. It would not be assured to preserve orderly markets in all cases. And it
would be insufficient if a firm was actually insolvent.

A quite different, and rather more profound approach would be to deploy a super special resolution
framework that permitted the authorities, on a rapid timetable, to haircut uninsured creditors in a
going concern.

By haircutting creditors in a going concern, there would be no need to close the business
immediately (or, if regulators wished, even at all). That is a very high-level description. Variants
obviously exist. Instead of haircuts, uninsured creditors could have part of their claim converted into
equity. And it would need to be clear how the regime applied to the normal ranking in the capital
structure, with common equity and subordinated debt being wiped out before any senior unsecured
debt was haircut (or converted) at all.

Precisely because investment banking is highly levered, relatively small percentage haircuts (or
conversions to equity) could materially recapitalise a distressed firm. Creditors would recapitalise
distressed LCFIs, not the state. In that, it shares some features of contingent-capital bonds, but
would be on a statutory basis and could apply to all unsecured creditors in the extreme circumstances
of systemic distress.

The crucial feature is that haircuts/conversion would be applied up front to creditors of a going
concern. By contrast, under standard commercial-banking resolution regimes, the ‘bad bank’ goes
into an insolvency process as a gone concern, with de facto haircuts applied to its creditors ex post,
after realisation of the assets by the liquidator – a process that almost always destroys value. A
‘going concern’ approach would in effect combine features of standard regimes for resolving
commercial banks (rapidity, public policy objectives) with some features of the US Chapter 11 for
non-financial companies (haircuts for creditors in a continuing business). Of course, the kind of
super-special resolution regime I am airing could not be an exact replica of Chapter 11 – if only
because the capital structure of a distressed LCFI would have to be restructured very quickly, over a
weekend if not overnight, and so could not rely on a negotiated settlement with creditors.

For that reason alone, in common with the existing commercial-bank resolution regimes, there
would plainly need to be safeguards.1 Perhaps the most important might be that such super special

4

resolution powers could be applied only where the authorities made a formal determination that the
firm’s distress would otherwise seriously threaten systemic stability.

The modalities would, I suspect, end up varying according to countries’ particular circumstances.
In some, the financial authorities might decide the scale of the haircuts/conversions; perhaps in other
countries, it might be thought that a senior judge should decide on the basis of an application by the
financial authorities.

It is also worth saying that maintaining an LCFI in business through such means would neither
preclude nor of itself require regulatory action against management or, once the crisis had passed, to
wind-down parts or all of the business over time.

Nor would a regime of the broad kind I have sketched exclude restructuring banking groups into
functional subsidiaries, with different resolution tools applied to, say, deposit-taking/payments;
custody and global cash management; the business of illiquid lending to small and medium-sized
enterprises and households; trading/derivatives business or wholesale banking more generally. That
would not be inconsistent with reducing the number of legal entities in LCFI groups, perhaps by an
order of magnitude. The current FSB-sponsored work to develop “recovery and resolution plans”
for the top 25 or so LCFIs is designed to identify where those kind of steps are warranted.
Resolution could, therefore, take its place alongside structure and regulation as one of the key
elements of a reform package to strengthen the global financial system.

A super-special resolution regime along those lines would, on the face of it, go quite a long way
towards reintroducing market discipline – by putting uninsured creditors at risk even in systemic
situations. I am not innocent enough in the ways of the market to think that it wouldn’t affect
behaviour. Of course, it would lead to changes, over time, in the capital structure of investment
banking operations. Proper transitional periods would be needed.

I suggest that it is worth debating. Maybe there is a fatal flaw. We should certainly search for the
flaws. But if we do not find a way of resolving massive and complex trading books, the regulation
of the business would probably have to be fiercer than otherwise in order to crush the probability of
failure. Resolution is a way of coping with failure. Key voices are the non-bank financial sector and
the corporate treasurers who finance the banking system. What would they get out of it? They
might benefit from avoiding the risk that the authorities choose to liquidate a LCFI they had thought
5

was too big to fail, with the depletion of value that entails; think of Lehman. They would, in effect,
be trading off losses in one part of their portfolio against the prospect of protecting the rest of their
investments from the fallout of a credit crunch that would follow the disorderly demise of a
distressed LCFI.

The cross-border dimension

The other big issue is how to handle the resolution of internationally active banks. This is a
challenge even for fairly vanilla commercial banking groups.

There has been a Basel Concordat on how home and host authorities should co-operate in
supervising international banks since 1975. It was updated in 1983 and 1992 to take account of
group-level consolidated supervision following the failures of Banco Ambrosiano and then BCCI.
But was the Concordat based on a false premiss: that the division of supervisory-labour during
peacetime can carry smoothly over to the only period that really matters, distress?

Because, as it happens, neither standard resolution regimes for commercial banks nor any super-SRR
of the kind I have just outlined for going-concern restructurings could be applied easily to the
cross-border activities of LCFIs. SRR tools cannot automatically be applied extraterritorially.

It seems to me that policymakers need to face up to, and decide whether or not to fix, the really big
issues about how insolvency and resolution laws are applied to internationally active financial
companies.

Broadly speaking, countries’ laws apply either territorial principles to international insolvencies,
consistent with separate procedures for each of a bank’s entities in different jurisdictions (so-called
“separate-entity resolution”); or universal principles, consistent with a single procedure applying to
the resolution of an international bank and its branches abroad, wherever they are located
(“single-entity resolution”).

I believe that top-level policymakers have to choose what kind of

regime they want. This issue needs to be elevated above the level of middle-ranking technocrats
where, through no great fault of their own, it has wallowed for too long. The issues were articulated
as long as 20 years ago, following BCCI’s failure.2 Nothing much has been done globally.

So in the second half of my remarks today, I just want to sketch why this problem arises.
6

(i)

Territoriality

Territorial approaches to resolution are adopted due to potential conflicts of interest between home
and host-state authorities. These may reflect, for example, host countries not wanting to rely on
home countries to act in the interests of financial stability in the host country; or different or
conflicting triggers and objectives for Special Resolution Regime powers.

There are a number of problems with territoriality. It undermines coordinated and cooperative
resolutions, and creates uncertainty by encouraging a race for assets and collateral across
jurisdictions. Related to that, it reduces the effectiveness of Special Resolution Regimes by allowing
host authorities to ring-fence local assets for the benefit of local creditors. And, it can even render
resolution infeasible if the legal structure of an LCFI differs substantially from its operational
structure, with local legal entities dependent on other parts of the group for vital services.

Greater harmonisation of SRRs across the major jurisdictions might help to reduce distrust in other
countries’ approaches. But harmonisation does not remove the potential conflict of interests
between home and host authorities.

The current debate around subsidiarisation of global commercial banking groups stems in large part
from these problems. The thought is that if policymakers cannot solve the territorial problem, then
they should embrace it – banking would go local, with a degree of ring fencing. That course may
conceivably have wider advantages – for example, in the area of macroprudential regulation3 it
might give authorities a greater degree of influence over domestic credit conditions. But we do also
need to consider whether there might be costs to such an approach. For those policy issues to reach
closure, we need to know the way forward on resolution.

(ii)

Pure universalism

What of the other end of the spectrum? In principle, an alternative approach would be to shift to a
more universal approach. A pure form of universalism would rule out separate resolution or
insolvency proceedings, ring-fencing and, therefore, a race for assets. It might encourage a more
cooperative approach to cross-border resolution. There would be one, global resolution, led by the
home authority.
7

But pure universalism also faces major obstacles. First, it would imply a surrender of national
sovereignty – replacing it with pre-defined and enforceable rules that determined the roles of
different authorities in different jurisdictions. Second, unless steps were taken to rule out the need
for sovereign Capital of Last Resort operations4, it might well need to be accompanied by an ex ante
burden-sharing mechanism, to facilitate a sharing of the costs of resolution across the jurisdictions in
which a bank had activities.

In theory, that could be addressed by the main home and host authorities of each LCFI agreeing a set
of binding principles to govern the distribution of the costs of a universal resolution across
jurisdictions. An alternative would be to design a single resolution regime for all LCFIs, to be
implemented along universal lines by a supranational resolution authority. But would countries be
prepared to tolerate the loss of fiscal independence and the overturning of national insolvency laws
that this model would entail, especially if it required governments to commit to recompense the
agency for unlimited amounts in the future? That is most definitely not a question for central
bankers.

(iii) Modified universalism

Pure territoriality and pure universalism are corner solutions. We live in a world where some
countries are closer to one corner, others closer to the other.

Some have suggested that an intermediate solution might be feasible. This would involve
“territorial” countries deciding to resolve financial institutions headquartered in their own
jurisdictions on a universal basis. (A possible example of this approach in the recent crisis was the
FDIC’s resolution of United Commercial Bank, which involved a “purchase and assumption”5 that
extended to the Chinese subsidiary and the Hong Kong branch following coordination amongst the
authorities in the US, China and Hong Kong.)

A ‘modified’ form of universalism would involve host authorities choosing to defer to and cooperate
with a resolution brought by the home country authorities, provided that certain conditions held.
Separate insolvency proceedings might be employed by host countries, but allowing the proceeds to
be remitted to the home country, ‘lead’ resolution. Variations might be needed for subsidiaries and
branches. Subsidiaries are distinct legal entities, but they too can have worldwide creditors and
claims. So it would all need to be within some kind of joined-up whole.
8

At a high level, the preconditions for something like this might include:

(1)

equitable treatment of all creditors regardless of their jurisdiction, because if creditors in
host countries were likely to be penalised in a resolution brought by the home country
authorities, host authorities would have a strong incentive to ring-fence;

(2)

broad harmonisation of resolution regimes across the major jurisdictions.

Also, if governments do continue to contemplate the possibility of fiscal support in a crisis, then
there might need to be some kind of agreement – conceivably case by case - on principles governing
the contributions imposed on each country to meeting the costs of the resolution. But the ideas I
aired in the first part of the remarks were aimed at helping to take that off the table.

A principle of equitable treatment of worldwide creditors and depositors would be consistent with
the imposition of losses on unsecured creditors or uninsured depositors, either in a going-concern
restructuring of the kind I outlined earlier or through the application of more standard SRR tools to
gone-concern bad banks. But it would require losses to be imposed on an equitable basis, respecting
the existing priority ranking regardless of the jurisdictional-location of creditors. That might require
recognition across the main jurisdictions of certain safeguards.6 And, such an approach would
require binding agreements amongst home and host resolution authorities. Vague assurances would
not do the trick, as domestic authorities could change their minds when it really mattered. Host and
home authorities would need ‘skin in the game’ to underpin co-operation. And co-operation in
distressed circumstances could helpfully flow back to how supervisors work together in peacetime.

An obstacle to such an approach might be that in some countries, legislation mandates preferential
treatment of creditors and depositors of local entities of cross-border banks. But that might be
weighed by legislatures against the current reality that when the fiscal authority finds itself injecting
equity to save a bank and preserve stability, it protects worldwide creditors not just its home
creditors.

To be clear, I am not advocating any particular approach here. I just want the authorities to
articulate the issues clearly, so that our leaders can make a choice and think through the
consequences of that choice. I’m not sure that it has really been put to them up to now.
9

And, of course, whatever is done, within Europe we would need to find an EU version that sat
between national and global regimes.

Summary

My purpose today is not to advocate solutions. It is to identify the big issues and to float some
possible avenues for discussion in the EU and internationally.

The big question is clear enough. Can we resolve distressed LCFIs in an orderly way without
injecting public money?

One possible way to cut through Too-Big-To-Fail is to adjust our sense of what ‘Fail’ involves.
Perhaps it does not have to involve liquidation or administration. Perhaps it does not have to involve
a binary shift from ‘going concern’ to ‘gone concern’. But it does have to involve loss for equity
holders and uninsured creditors. It does have to rekindle market discipline. It does have to preserve
the flow of financial services. Those are, surely, the essential components of the resolution leg of
the regulation, structure, resolution triangle that make up the reform debate.

Individual countries or economic areas such as the EU can get only so far on their own. To cope
with distress in global banking, we need to decide whether or not we want international collaboration
in the resolution of cross-border banking groups. That is a question which, one way or another, the
highest reaches of the authorities should answer as part of the reform debate. Once that is clear,
some of the questions about structure and regulation might become clearer.

A lot rests on whether we can resolve distressed LCFIs. We need to answer the big questions.
