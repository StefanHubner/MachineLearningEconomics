Next month will be the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Smithsonian Agreement – hailed at
the time by President Nixon as ‘the most significant monetary agreement in the history of
the world’. Today it is remembered, if at all, as a stage in the collapse of the Bretton
Woods system of pegged exchange rates. But it also inaugurated a period of intense
debate about the future of the international monetary system and the role of the
International Monetary Fund, which culminated in the Second Amendment to the Fund’s
Articles in 1976.

Thirty years on, the Fund’s role in promoting international monetary stability is again
under scrutiny. The world economy and the international monetary system have been
transformed since the late 1970s. The Fund has evolved to deal with new situations and
fresh crises. But much more change is needed if it is to meet the challenges of the 21st
century. That much is common ground.

Proposals to reinvigorate the Fund’s oversight of the international monetary system –
surveillance – lie at the heart of the Medium Term Strategy endorsed at this year’s Spring
Meeting of the IMF. Together with the more widely publicised, and politically charged,
commitment to reform the Fund’s governance, by rebalancing the quotas that determine
member countries’ voting rights, they represent a serious attempt, in the words of the
Fund’s Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato, to ‘meet the challenges posed by
globalisation.’

The main purpose of my lecture tonight will be to explain the role which a refocused
Fund could and should be playing in promoting international monetary stability, and to
outline some steps to build on the agreements reached at the Fund’s Annual meetings in
Singapore in September. The next six months will be critical. It is important that we use
them to think hard about what the Fund does, as well as to push forward the second stage
of the governance agenda.

The changing role of the IMF

2

The IMF was originally set up at the end of the Second World War ‘to promote
international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the
machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems’. The
collapse of the system of pegged exchange rates in the early 1970s precipitated a lengthy
debate between those, led by the French, who favoured a return to managed exchange
rates, and others, led by the Americans, who favoured floating exchange rates. When a
compromise was eventually reached, the Fund’s Articles were amended to allow Member
countries to choose between fixed, floating or managed exchange rate regimes, as long as
they fulfilled certain commitments.

Members agreed to collaborate with the Fund and other countries to assure external
stability through ‘orderly exchange arrangements and … a stable system of exchange
rates’. They also assumed specific obligations relating to their domestic and external
policies. They agreed to avoid manipulating exchange rates to prevent effective balance
of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage. And they agreed to
direct their domestic policies toward fostering orderly economic growth and price
stability.

The Fund’s role was also redefined. It was required: first ‘to oversee the international
monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation’, and second to ‘exercise firm
surveillance over the exchange rate policies of its members and to adopt specific
principles for the guidance of all members with respect to these policies’. These
principles were subsequently spelt out in a 1977 Surveillance Decision, which focussed
narrowly on exchange rate policies.

Surveillance duly became one of the Fund’s core activities, alongside lending and
providing technical assistance. But over the years, the focus of surveillance drifted away
from exchange rate issues, as the Fund’s central role in promoting international monetary
cooperation went into eclipse. Its public profile was dominated by its frequently
controversial role as a provider of financial assistance to countries facing external
payments crises. International monetary policy coordination, on the few occasions when
it was actively attempted, became the preserve of small inter-governmental groups of

3

leading industrialised countries, the G5/7 – most famously in the Plaza and Louvre
Accords in the mid 1980s.

Over time, the international monetary system has evolved into a patchwork of different
approaches to policy, in contrast to the uniformity of the Bretton Woods system. Many
large developed countries with open capital markets now pursue independent monetary
polices and let their exchange rates float freely, while smaller and less developed
countries tend to peg or heavily manage their exchange rates, effectively surrendering
control over domestic inflation. There are regional monetary unions – notably the euro
zone. And some emerging and developing economies still combine managed exchange
rates with restrictions on capital flows, in an attempt to retain a degree of monetary
independence.

How has the world economy changed?

The backdrop to these developments has been a transformation in the world economy
over the past thirty years. For the present purposes, there are two major aspects to what
is commonly known as ‘globalisation’.

First, there has been a very rapid integration of the world economy. Trade liberalisation,
new technology, falling communication costs, and the resulting globalisation of supply
chains have contributed to a great opening in national markets. Since 1970, trade
openness – defined as the ratio of exports and imports to GDP – has risen from around
25% to over 40% for industrialised countries, and from 15% to 60% for emerging
markets. The growth and integration of financial and capital markets has been even more
spectacular, especially over the past 20 years. Financial openness – defined as the ratio
of external assets and liabilities to GDP - has risen seven-fold for both groups of
countries.

Second, the dramatic rise of new economic powers has been simultaneously adding to
global productive capacity, and changing the balance of world trade and economic
activity.

4

The entry of China, India and Eastern Europe into the global market economy has
effectively doubled the world’s supply of labour. The sheer scale and speed of economic
development in China alone has been quite without precedent. After 25 years of doubledigit growth, it is now the world’s fourth largest economy, having overtaken the UK this
year. Its share of world trade has more than doubled over the past decade, making it the
third largest trading country behind the US and Germany.

Increasingly, a small group of industrialised countries will no longer dominate the world
economy in the way they did 30 years ago. Measured at market exchange rates, the G7
still accounts for 60% of world output. But if current growth differentials persist, this
share will fall to 40% within the next 20 years. And if output is measured using
purchasing power parities – to give a higher, and arguably more accurate, weight to
relatively cheap non-traded goods and services in emerging markets - the G7 world share
has already fallen to that level.

Emerging markets are already a major force in the world economy. Together they make
up 80% of the world’s population, use half the world’s energy and produce over 40% of
the world’s exports. And over the last five years they have accounted for well over half
of total world growth.

Implications for policy

Taken together, these developments have profound implications for policy-makers. The
linkages between one economy and another are now wider, deeper and more complex
than ever before. One country’s policy is more likely to have ‘spill over’ effects on other
countries. The interpretation of economic developments has become more challenging.
And the rapid emergence of new economic superpowers is creating a new generation of
policy issues.

For example, the addition of large supplies of low cost labour to the world market is
affecting global relative prices, especially of manufactured goods and natural resources,
as well as intensifying competition in labour and product markets. This seems to be
affecting wage and price setting behaviour in developed countries, as well as their terms

5

of trade. Domestic policy-makers have been left struggling to comprehend how
globalisation is changing the behaviour of their own economies, and thus the likely
impact of their own policy actions.

From a global perspective, the coexistence, in recent years, of low long-term real interest
rates, massive, and rising, US current account deficits and the build up of huge foreign
exchange reserves in Asia has been a source of particular puzzlement and some concern
to policy-makers.

How confident can we really be that the international monetary system can cope with the
stresses and strains of a fast integrating global economy? Deep and liquid financial
markets have made it possible to finance huge global imbalances, and may have helped to
stabilise the world economy in recent years. But there must be a risk, even if it is fairly
remote, that imbalances will unwind in an abrupt or disorderly way which could damage
growth and push up inflation.

Globalisation is raising the stakes for policymakers. Closer collaboration should help
them to take better informed decisions. It can deepen their understanding of the impact of
global developments and policy spillovers, and give them insights into the likely
responses of other policy-makers to different scenarios. In a more closely integrated
world economy, there is a greater shared interest in identifying the risks to international
monetary stability and in discussing the policy responses that might help to mitigate
them.

The Fund and international monetary co-operation – the issues

But even if we accept the case for intensified international monetary collaboration in
today’s highly inter-connected world, does the Fund still have a central role to play? And
if so, what is it?

6

There are two main reasons why, in my view, it does.

First, there is an important role for a permanent institution as a provider of internationally
consistent information, impartial expert analysis, assessment and advice. Today’s world
economy is no longer dominated by a small group of like-minded industrialised countries
at similar stages of development; tomorrow’s will be even less so. A shared knowledge
base will facilitate effective consultation and collaboration on complex and politically
charged issues. This is essentially a public good. And while it is possible to envisage
alternative arrangements for supplying it, a permanent international institution is likely to
offer clear practical advantages.

Second, the Fund already exists. It has the reach and experience to respond flexibly to
the changing structure of the world economy. It has nearly universal membership, (now
totalling 184 sovereign nations), an agreed legal framework, extensive relevant
institutional capacity and a reputation built up over sixty years. Given the costs of
acquiring such unique capacity from scratch in the modern world, the benefits of starting
again would need to be very substantial indeed.

This adds up to a strong pragmatic case for working with what we have.
So what role should the Fund be playing? Mervyn King, in his speech in Delhi earlier
this year, likened the role of the IMF to an umpire in cricket, ‘warning the players not to
attack each other verbally and making it clear publicly when they believe the players are
not abiding with the spirit of the game’.
While I would be the last person to argue with Mervyn, at least about cricket, I initially
found this analogy rather unconvincing. In my mind, the term umpire conjures up a
portly old gentleman in a white coat and straw boater. Surely the modern IMF should
have a more dynamic and up to date image? But it turns out that even cricket has moved
on. I am not referring to the recent abandonment of the England Pakistan match, for the
first time ever, after a heated disagreement between an umpire and players. No, what I
have in mind is the advanced computer technology which I gather now exists, aptly
named Hawk-Eye, which could assist umpires in making the most difficult calls – those
about which the players of the game are most likely to disagree.

7

So we should think of the IMF as the cricket umpire of the future, with Hawk-Eye in her
toolkit – where the Fund’s Hawk-Eye will be its impartial analysis, assessment and
advice, enabling it to dissect the most difficult policy issues in the global economy.
Reforming the Fund’s surveillance
If that is the vision, the relevant questions are whether the Fund’s current surveillance
activities are well designed to meet the need; and if not, what can be done to improve
matters?

The answer to the first question is clearly no. Despite many reviews, the underpinning
Surveillance Decision, agreed three decades ago, has never been revised. And over that
time Fund surveillance has drifted a long way from its original – narrowly defined –
purpose. Fortunately, there is now broad agreement about the main problems that need
addressing.

First, the Fund does not devote enough time and effort to overseeing the system as a
whole, through assessing global economic prospects and analysing international
economic linkages and policy spillovers (so-called multilateral surveillance). Instead, the
great bulk of the Fund’s effort has been devoted to producing reports on individual
member countries (so-called bilateral surveillance).

Second, these individual country assessments have often lacked focus. The subjects
covered have ranged widely, reflecting the preoccupations of the day, including much
detail on so called ‘structural’ issues. Nor has bilateral surveillance been good at picking
up multilateral issues - areas where a country’s policies might have wider effects, or
where it might be particularly exposed to global risks.

The Fund’s analysis needs to be better focussed on the big global issues, including
financial issues and on the interactions between different regions and countries. This
means devoting more effort to analysing multilateral issues and to integrating bilateral
and multilateral surveillance; and it means being ruthlessly selective in dealing with
structural issues, by testing their relevance to external stability. It also means putting

8

more emphasis on the surveillance of those countries with the most potential to create
waves in the international monetary system.

Finally, the relatively puny effort devoted to multilateral surveillance is not having
enough influence on members’ policies. According to the Independent Evaluation Office
(IEO) report published earlier this year, there is ‘too much weight on providing
information on economic developments and too little on analysing economic policy
linkages and identifying scope for collective action’. The Fund needs to make more of its
presence at inter-governmental groups such as the G7 and the G20. And it needs to
experiment with more flexible ways of exploring key policy issues with relevant groups
of members, to add depth to the formal exchanges typical of large set-piece international
gatherings.

After a couple of years debate, the prospects for achieving meaningful reform now look
promising, following the Fund’s Annual meetings in Singapore. The agenda for
reforming surveillance includes a new focus on multilateral issues, including global
financial issues and a new procedure for multilateral surveillance. The Managing
Director has launched a first round of multilateral consultations on global imbalances.
These are a potentially important innovation in the way the Fund interacts with key
policy-makers, but as they are still under way, I shall not comment further.

Instead I want to focus on the other key area for reform, where there are some important
outstanding issues. This is the work now in hand to clarify and update the operational
guidance on surveillance, through a thorough review of the 1977 Decision and by
designing a new annual remit for surveillance. This is aiming to provide a clear, up-todate set of guiding principles, and a firmer operational foundation for surveillance.

This matters because the Fund can only be effective in encouraging countries to fulfil
their obligations if there is a clear and shared view of what those commitments are, and a
coherent and transparent operational framework for assessing compliance. There also
needs to be greater clarity about the Fund’s obligations, and how it is to be held to
account for fulfilling them.

9

A new Surveillance Decision

The 1977 Surveillance Decision needs to be replaced by a coherent and comprehensive
set of principles covering all aspects of the Fund’s surveillance. A new Decision should
start from the overarching objective to promote external stability. Consistent with this, it
should shift the emphasis toward multilateral surveillance and the analysis of policy
spillovers. And, unlike the 1977 Decision, it should cover both exchange rate policies
and domestic policies insofar as they may affect external stability, rather than exchange
rate policies, per se.

This is a key area where the consensus has moved on since the late 1970s.

It is now well recognised that exchange rate policies cannot be divorced from domestic
policies. Where exchange rates are allowed to float freely, the paths they take will be
affected by a wide range of domestic factors, including both monetary and fiscal policies.
These policies can have significant foreign exchange and spill-over effects even when
they are not implemented for an explicit balance of payments purpose. But even where
nominal exchange rates are pegged, competitiveness and hence trade flows depend
crucially on relative inflation rates, which reflect domestic monetary and financial
policies. So both the effects of a fixed exchange rate, and questions about whether such a
peg is sustainable at a given level, depend fundamentally on other domestic policies.

In short, what is now needed is a new decision which will provide a comprehensive
framework for surveillance; which will approach members’ obligations explicitly from
the perspective of external stability; and which will do so in terms which can readily be
made operational. And it must be written in clear and unambiguous language.

This is a tall order I know – so here are some suggestions.

One very simple way of keeping surveillance focused would be to include a ‘selectivity
principle’ in a new Decision. This would say that the scope of all surveillance activities
should be based on their relevance to external stability: and that what matters is how a
member’s policies could affect the rest of the world.

10

The most difficult challenge will be to state members’ commitments in terms that are
both general enough to take account of their very different economic circumstances, and
specific enough to provide a clear focus for IMF surveillance. Striking the right balance
is essential if a new framework is to provide a useful basis for assessing industrialised
countries, emerging markets, and developing countries alike in a way that will be
accepted as even handed.

A good way of meeting this challenge would be to ground surveillance in a more
structured analysis of the policy frameworks which countries themselves choose to adopt.
The Fund could then focus on identifying areas where a member’s policy frameworks
might be unsustainable or inconsistent with external stability, and then offer policy
recommendations tailored to the circumstances of the country or countries concerned.

How might this work in practice?

Member countries would each provide a systematic description of their chosen policy
frameworks in key areas - relating to monetary, fiscal, financial, and exchange rate
policies. For these purposes, a policy framework is just a more or less formal description
of a country’s policy objectives and the policy instruments that have been assigned to
meet them, including any policy rules, targets or strategies that may be used as a guide to
decision-taking.

This approach would exploit the Fund’s already significant access to information about
members’ policy frameworks, and if necessary its power to request more. And it would
also avoid prescription and explicitly recognise members’ undoubted right to choose their
own policy frameworks, providing that they are consistent with their commitments under
the Articles.

Given this starting point, Fund surveillance could then focus on two key sets of issues.

First, is an individual country’s set of monetary, fiscal, financial, and exchange rate
frameworks internally consistent?

11

The key questions would be: is this a sustainable approach to policy? And is policy
being implemented in a way which is consistent with the stated framework? Taken
together are the policy frameworks adopted by a member consistent with its obligations
under the Fund’s Articles, including the member’s overarching commitment to
collaborate with the Fund and other members to assure external stability?

The Asian crisis of the late 1990s illustrates the problems that can develop from
internally inconsistent financial and exchange rate policies. There were fundamental
inconsistencies between rapidly-liberalised capital accounts, still under-developed
financial systems, and pegged exchange rates. This led to excessive investment through
financial intermediaries, and the accumulation of a great deal of foreign-currency debt,
much of which was un-hedged. When the full extent of this vulnerability became
apparent, there were full-blown currency and financial sector crises.

Second, are different countries’ policy frameworks consistent with one another?

If different members’ policy frameworks are inconsistent, this could inhibit external
adjustment, and pose a potential threat to external stability. So the key area for
multilateral surveillance would be to identify where different countries’ policy
frameworks might conflict with one another and to propose remedies before this
threatened the stability of the international monetary system.

You can argue that inconsistent policy frameworks lay at the root of the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis in 1992. German monetary policy successfully targeted
domestic price stability. The UK was pegging its exchange rate to the DM in order to
import this stability. But when the Germans adopted a new approach to fiscal policy,
running a structural deficit to finance infrastructure investment in the east - essentially
adopting a new fiscal policy framework - German interest rates had to rise to keep
domestic inflation in check. But keeping UK interest rates high enough to maintain the
exchange rate would have been very contractionary. Arguably, the UK and German
policy frameworks had become incompatible. Something had to give – in this case
sterling’s membership of the ERM.

12

This analysis of policy frameworks would help to focus bilateral surveillance, and
provide a better basis for multilateral surveillance, and for integrating the two. It should
throw up issues that could be pursued either with individual members or broader groups
as appropriate.

An annual remit

Better guidance for Fund surveillance should be buttressed by strengthened
accountability for performance. For this, we need a clearer definition of what the Fund’s
surveillance is expected to deliver. A good way of doing this would be to set an annual
surveillance remit for the Fund’s Managing Director - an idea endorsed by the IMFC last
April.

There are a number of overlapping mechanisms for setting priorities and assessing
performance which now operate across the broad range of the Fund’s work programme,
through the Executive Board. But a surveillance remit would provide a sharper means
for holding Fund management and staff to account for their performance on this key
aspect of their work.

Of course, it would need to work with the grain of the Fund’s overall governance
arrangements. This throws up two tricky issues. First, who sets the remit and how? And
second, how is the Fund’s performance to be evaluated, and by whom? These issues
require detailed consideration, but let me offer a few thoughts.

First, the process for setting the remit probably needs to involve both the Fund’s
Executive Board and the IMFC: the Board, because it is the body formally charged under
the Articles with the oversight of surveillance; and the IMFC, because of its heavyweight
political composition. The involvement of the most senior policy-makers matters,
because by endorsing the remit they are effectively giving the Fund a license to discuss
their policies. This is empowering to the Fund. One way for this to work might be for
the Board to present a draft to the IMFC for discussion at the spring meeting each year,
taking its cue from the IMFC communiqué issued the previous autumn.

13

Second, one obstacle to relying exclusively on the Executive Board to evaluate the
Fund’s performance arises from the position of the Managing Director, who is both Chair
of the Board and Head of the Fund Staff. But the MD’s position is embedded in the
Articles and raises much wider issues of governance. In the short term at least, this
argues for giving a significant role to the IMFC.

Third, the technical challenges in assessing the effectiveness of surveillance are
formidable. This points to giving an important role to the IEO which, since its
foundation in 2001, has been building up relevant expertise in assessing various aspects
of the Fund’s work.

How much difference can IMF surveillance really make?

This brings me to the crux of the matter: can IMF surveillance really make much
difference, even if it is reformed in the way I have described?

It is important to recognise that surveillance - especially multilateral surveillance - is a
very different kind of activity from the monitoring of reform programmes that may be
linked to Fund financial assistance packages. Lending programmes have exerted
considerable apparent leverage over countries’ behaviour at least in the short term,
through so called ‘conditionality’. In recent years the Fund’s lending activities have gone
into steep, and possibly irreversible, decline. But leverage of this kind has never been
available to force policy change on countries who do not borrow from the Fund, a
category which for the past 25 years has included all large industrialised countries.

The ‘traction’ of surveillance depends critically on the Fund’s ability to influence the
policies that countries choose to pursue. But is it realistic to suppose that the Fund can
any have real influence over the countries whose policies matter most?

14

The Fund’s constitution is cast in terms of the obligations that members owe to each
other and to the Fund. Such obligations are not without legal content, still less without
value. But the effectiveness of surveillance cannot rest on the strength or otherwise of
any treaty-based sanctions that might be used against members who fail to meet their
obligations.

The Fund’s chief weapon is persuasion, exerted through a combination of channels:
private advice, peer pressure, and public debate. But is this enough?

Excellent analysis can frame the issues that policy makers focus on; and it can shape and
inform the public debate, domestic and international, that leads to action. Ideas and
analysis, widely and well-communicated, can be very powerful in the modern world,
especially in the largest democracies. As Keynes reportedly remarked ‘Ideas shape the
course of history’.

The Fund can also facilitate dialogue between countries on issues where unilateral or
even bilateral decision-making may not be the best way forward. On the biggest global
issues, policies need to be designed with some depth of understanding about how others
will act.

But ultimately much turns on members’ confidence and trust in the Fund, and on the
depth of their continuing commitment to its original first purpose: ‘to promote
international monetary co operation through a permanent institution’. The support and
commitment of those countries whose policies have the greatest impact on the world
economy is clearly critical.

So the Fund’s ability to shape and facilitate the debate is intimately bound up with its
legitimacy. All countries need to feel they have a real stake in the governance of the
Fund and an effective voice in shaping its activities and the decisions taken by its Board.
This is why the governance agenda is so important and why there is a close link between
the surveillance agenda and the second stage of quota reform.

15

The broader point is that everyone needs to have confidence that the Fund is fair and
impartial in the way it goes about its work. Surveillance needs to be free from any
perception of bias if it is to be credible. This is sensitive territory. Members are
prohibited from attempting to influence staff as they discharge their functions. But
present arrangements offer plenty of scope for misperceptions. There is a fuzzy boundary
between legitimate concern for the quality and relevance of surveillance and improper
pressure on staff to fudge difficult issues or water down unpalatable conclusions. A
surveillance remit would clarify the boundaries between staff and members without
sacrificing accountability.

The role and performance of the Executive Board is clearly a critical issue. Putting to
one side the long-running debate about the case for shifting to a non-resident Board, there
is ample room for modernisation and improvement. Could the conflicts inherent in the
MD’s dual role be more transparently managed? And could the Board refocus it own
efforts to better support the wider surveillance agenda? Last year, for example, it spent
just 5% of its time mulling over multilateral surveillance issues – at a time when global
imbalances and energy prices were headline news.

Finally, reform is a process not an event. The structure, processes, incentives and culture
of an organisation whose core activity is surveillance are likely to be significantly
different from one whose primary focus is on lending to countries confronting financial
crises. Like many other organisations facing major change in its core business, the Fund
will need to be sure that everything it values and rewards is tuned to support its new
priorities.

Conclusion

Over the past fifteen years, the Great Inflation that followed the end of the Bretton
Woods system has been replaced by the Great Stability. Globalisation has brought great
benefits, but it is creating major challenges for policy makers.

How will such issues be handled in future?

16

The Fund certainly has the potential to act as an authoritative medium for international
monetary collaboration, providing its surveillance activities are re-focused on external
stability and the big global issues. The Managing Director’s current reform agenda is on
the right lines. But the Fund’s effectiveness in promoting international monetary stability
will depend critically on the organisation’s stature as a trusted and respected source of
dispassionate analysis and impartial advice. And it will rest above all on the willingness
of its members – large as well as small - to use it as their instrument to improve the
quality of their own policy making.

Equipping the Fund with its own version of Hawk-Eye will not be enough. In the end it
will be down to them – or more accurately, us.
