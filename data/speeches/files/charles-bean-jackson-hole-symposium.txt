Comments on Ken Rogoff: “Impact of Globalization on Monetary Policy”
Jackson Hole, 26/8/06
Like Gaul, Ken’s paper is divided into three parts: the impact of globalization on the inflationary
process; the connections between globalization and asset price volatility; and the implications of
openness for the conduct of monetary policy. I shall say a few words on each.
If you ask the average businessman why inflation has been low over the past decade, he or she is
almost certain to reply that it is down to cheap imports from the Far East and Eastern Europe.
Monetary policy probably won’t get a look in, yet we know that inflation must ultimately be a
monetary phenomenon. The answer, of course, is that globalization represents a shock to relative,
not absolute, prices. What happens to the general price level depends on what monetary policy
makers then decide to do. But there is, as Ken notes, a grain of truth in the popular view, in so far
as the beneficial terms of trade shock has temporarily lowered the natural rate of unemployment and
provided a favourable ‘tailwind’ to central banks’ attempts to hold inflation down.
But winds can be changeable, and Ken notes that the process may go into reverse at some point. To
an extent this may already be happening. While the Sino-Indian development miracle probably has
some way to run, the near-tripling of oil prices over the past couple of years, and the rise in
commodity prices more generally, is surely itself in large part a reflection of the rapid
industrialisation of China and the other emerging economies. The fact that the rise in oil prices is
the flip side of the globalization shock to me renders highly suspect the practice of focussing on
measures of core inflation that strip out energy prices while retaining the falling goods prices.
The structural changes in the industrialised economies brought about by globalization seem rather
more fundamental. Increased competition from labour-abundant economies means that businesses
have less scope to raise their prices in the face of strong demand. And workers have less scope to
negotiate higher earnings when faced with potential off-shoring and actual or threatened use of
migrant labour. As well as raising the natural rate of output, domestic inflation becomes less
sensitive to the domestic output gap and potentially more sensitive to the world output gap1. Such a
flattening of the short-run Phillips curve has indeed been observed in a number of industrialised
countries, and appears to be partly related to increased openness2, though the fact that the flattening
began in the late 1980s or early 1990s suggests that the decline in inflation may also be a factor.

Some recent empirical studies also find a heightened role for global output gaps in national Phillips
curves3.
At this conference three years ago, Ken argued that these structural changes would increase the
incentive to stabilise inflation at a low level. I don’t propose to say anything more on the political
economy arguments, other than that they seem less relevant for countries with inflation-targeting
central banks like my own, than they do for countries where policy might be more subject to
political considerations.
However, I do think it is worth dwelling on the implications of these structural changes in the
inflation process for the conduct of monetary policy. On the face of it, the flattening of the Phillips
curve appears to be both good news and bad news for policymakers. The good news is that demand
shocks and policy errors will not show up in large deviations of inflation from target, if one starts
from there. The bad news is that if inflation starts above target, then it appears to be more costly to
get it down. When coupled with the fact that increased capital market integration potentially
reduces the central bank’s leverage over domestic real interest rates, it therefore might appear that
monetary policy is losing traction as far as the control of domestic inflation goes.
This would be going too far. Although the channel of transmission via domestic demand might be
weaker, monetary policy would still impact on the price level through the nominal exchange rate
and through inflation expectations. But the link from interest rates to exchange rates does not seem
to a very tight one, and we still understand relatively little about how inflation expectations are
formed. So the impact of policy decisions might become rather less predictable. Certainly
maintaining the very high degree of inflation stability that we have seen over the last decade may
prove difficult.
Globalization also appears to have affected the way economies respond to cost shocks. One reason
why the impact of higher oil prices has been relatively benign is that wages and prices have not
reacted in the way they did in the 1970s. In part that may be a result of the counter-inflationary
credibility of monetary policies. But it also appears that heightened competitive pressures mean
that businesses have frequently felt unable to pass such increases on in higher prices and have
instead looked to lower costs, either by granting lower wage increases, or by putting downward

pressure on the costs of other inputs, or by raising efficiency. Certainly that is what our business
contacts in the United Kingdom have been telling us4.
Turning to the second theme in the paper, Ken observes that the well-documented decline in the
volatility of output (and inflation) witnessed over the past two decades or so has not been matched
by lower volatility in equity prices and exchange rates. While the jury is still out on the relative
importance of structural changes, better monetary policy and plain good luck, it is plausible that at
least some of the increased macroeconomic stability is connected to globalization, in particular
more complete risk shifting in better integrated financial markets, as well as the aforementioned
changes in wage and price behaviour.
But why haven’t asset prices become more stable too? Certainly standard theories of equity pricing
might lead one to expect such an outcome if profits have become more stable. Ken makes the neat
and original point that, as a simple matter of arithmetic, a reduction in the rate used to discount
those profits means that a given variance in that discount rate will generate proportionately bigger
swings in asset prices. So lower risk-free rates, and lower risk premia associated with greater
stability, might help explain the absence of any noticeable decline in asset price volatility as
normally measured. This sort of argument doesn’t appear capable of rationalising the findings in
regard to the exchange rate, though.
In the coda to his paper, Ken suggests that the greatest challenge to monetary policy during the
globalization period has been this continuing volatility of asset prices. My take is slightly different.
I do not think it is volatility per se that has troubled policy makers – after all the swings in asset
prices appear to have been no greater than in earlier periods. Rather, policymakers have at various
times had to judge whether elevated equity prices, bond prices, house prices or exchange rates are
justified by changed fundamentals or instead are likely to correct sharply, jeopardising both
monetary and financial stability.
Finally, Ken tackles the more specific question of how openness should affect the choice of target
price index – or, equivalently, what sorts of shocks justify a deviation for a given target price index.
There is now a growing theoretical literature on the appropriate choice of target on efficiency
grounds, which suggests that it hinges on the location of the nominal rigidities in the economy, the
basic principle being to seek to stabilise the prices that are relatively sticky. In an open economy
context, a lot then depends on how imported goods are treated, with the majority of studies

unfortunately ignoring the pricing-to-market and slow pass-through that we observe in the real
world.
Although the theoretical debate is not yet closed, Ken believes that is unwise for policy to react to
the exchange rate independently of its effects on future consumer price inflation and output, but that
there is a case for the accommodation of terms of trade shocks. I have argued elsewhere5 that
concerns that asset price boom-busts may generate medium-term instability can still be adequately
captured within a framework of flexible inflation targeting by adopting a suitably elongated time
horizon, so I find Ken’s conclusion in regard to exchange rates entirely reasonable, especially given
the apparent noise in exchange rate movements to which he draws attention.
As to his conclusion that terms-of-trade shocks should be accommodated to some degree, I think
that is an argument that most of the central bankers in the audience will recognise, even the inflation
targeters. However, to me the most important issue is not whether there is a theoretical case for
such accommodation. Rather it is whether there are likely to be any adverse effects on inflation
expectations and credibility from doing so. Even if we explain that our intention is only to
accommodate the first-round effect of a major adverse terms-of-trade shock – such as the recent rise
in oil prices – and not any second-round effects, can we be sure that households and firms will
behave appropriately and that medium-term inflation expectations will remain anchored? At
present, that is not something the literature helps us answer. But given the potential costs of
restoring credibility once it is lost, it may be better to err on the side of caution.
Overall, the changes wrought by globalization seem to have been beneficial to the pursuit of low
and stable inflation in the industrialised economies, even if the mechanisms have been a bit more
subtle than the popular view of the role of China and the other industrialising countries suggests.
But globalization has also created tensions at the microeconomic level in the shape of growing
protectionist pressures in the adversely affected sectors and at the macroeconomic level in the form
of the global current account imbalances. These still have the potential to upset the apple cart. So
let me conclude with a couple of old Chinese proverbs: “There is no never-ending banquet under
the sun” and “Good luck seldom comes in pairs, but bad things never walk alone”. Policymakers
may do well to remember them.
