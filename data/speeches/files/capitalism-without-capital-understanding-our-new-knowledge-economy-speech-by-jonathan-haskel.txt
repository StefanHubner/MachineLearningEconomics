Rowntree is more than just a confectionery factory.
It is an honour to have been invited to give the Ken Dixon lecture at the University of York this year on the topic
of the intangible economy.
It has been a pleasure to spend time on the campus talking to students as well as to spend time talking to
businesses in the region today. I also want to thank Ken Dixon for his support for the University for many years.
Today I will talk about a new type of economy. But one, as it turns out, that should be familiar to him.
Perhaps some of you might know that Ken Dixon worked for a British confectionery company, Rowntree
Mackintosh. Rowntree was founded in York in 1725 by a cocoa and chocolate vendor who sold the business to
the Rowntree family in 1862. Later, in 1970, Rowntree merged with John Mackintosh & Sons. You might be
familiar with some of Rowntree’s brands such as: Fruit Gums, Quality Street, KitKat, Aero, After Eights, etc. The
old factory was based on Haxby Road, just a 15 minutes’ drive from the University. What made Rowntree
particularly successful, though, was not just the production of chocolate but the value of its brands.
In 1981, Ken Dixon was appointed chairman and CEO of Rowntree Mackintosh. At the time, Rowntree wasn’t
doing so well. Its profitability was down compared to the mid-1970s. Mr Dixon started a long-term programme to
turn Rowntree around. He invested £400 million to improve manufacturing efficiency and upgrade capacity so
that Rowntree could produce greater volumes of KitKats and Smarties. But Mr Dixon also invested substantially
in brand development. Rowntree was very successful at using marketing to develop its brands (Fitzgerald,
2007). According to Mr Dixon: ‘The fundamental idea which drives Rowntree is branding, the creation of distinct,
differentiated, positively identifiable and market positioned goods.’ (Hyde, Ellert and Killing, 1991).
Thus, Rowntree’s success was not just due to its use of production methods and facilities but also due to the
value of brands which fostered customer loyalty and generated future demand for its products. The value of
Rowntree’s assets was not just the buildings and machines it owned and used to produce confectionery. It was
also something less tangible, the value of its brand names. Nestle recognised the value of Rowntree’s brands
and this is why when it took Rowntree over in 1988 the price it paid for the company exceeded tangible assets
by 300% (Nielsen, 1993). This price represented more than double of Rowntree’s pre-bid market capitalisation
(Mather and Peasnell, 1991).
What Rowntree’s story tells us is that the value of companies and the value of their assets is not just what we
can see. It is also what is less visible but still gives companies the ability to generate profits over many years.
Nestlé today is a major corporation. It owns many factories but is also owns numerous brands and invests in
both brand development and scientific research and development (R&D). For example, Nestlé’s factory still
produces KitKats on Haxby Road but Nestlé also continues to operate a R&D centre in York developing new
technologies and innovative products.

Today, I will talk about how our economies have changed, the role of intangible capital and intangible investment
and why that matters for understanding how firms behave differently than in the past.

Not all investments are things you can touch.
My book with Stian Westlake is titled ‘Capitalism without Capital’ but if there is no capital how does this even
make sense? In our view, to understand the world today it is important to make a distinction between tangible
and intangible capital. Let me illustrate with some examples that might better explain what we mean by tangible
and intangible capital and why economies have shifted towards intangible capital.
In 2018, some of the world’s largest companies by market capitalisation were Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft,
Amazon and Tencent (Table 1). When you look at their balance sheets, they actually had very little tangible
capital. For example, Microsoft only had $5bn worth of tangible capital in 2016 but $85bn worth1 of R&D capital.
Alphabet (Google) has $20bn of tangible capital but $53bn of R&D capital in the same year. Why are their
tangible assets so small relative to their market value? What is going on?
Table 1 – Top 10 global companies by market capitalisation

Tangible assets are the values of buildings, equipment and vehicles. These are the assets that accountants can
measure well. But a moment’s reflection on the companies will convince you that their business relies very little
on such assets. Rather, their assets are software, reputation, relationships and knowledge. That is, they are
intangible assets. These assets are called, by economists, capital assets or capital for short. A capital asset is
something owned by the firm that gives it a long-lived (more than a year) stream of services that it can use in
production. A machine or building or vehicle is a tangible capital asset, or tangible capital. Knowledge from
R&D, software, reputation and brands are also assets but intangible.
So, what do the accounts say about these? Well, they say very little since the rules for reporting intangible
assets are mixed. Broadly speaking, firms don’t have to report them. If you do a lot of digging in company
accounts you might find reported figures for spending on R&D. But even then the figure is small. That’s

1

These are the cumulated values of reported expenditure on R&D since the companies began.
3

because R&D doesn’t capture a lot of their activities. The fact illustrated above, that these leading companies
work with very little measured capital, explains the title of our book. Namely, business for them can be described
as capitalism without capital.

Tangible and intangible capital
Table 2 sets out the capital we are talking about. On the left are the tangible business investments: buildings,
ICT equipment like computer hardware, non-ICT equipment and vehicles. On the right are intangibles: software,
databases, design, mineral exploration, R&D, and business processes, for example. These intangibles in the
right column are those elements of spending that business and national accountants have been reluctant to
count as investment although over the last forty years some of them have been included as such.

Intangible assets are different than tangible assets in important ways. Intangible assets have, in our view, four
distinct properties that make them different to tangible assets. These are: scalability, sunkenness, spill-overs
and synergies. Let me explain these in more detail.
Scalability
Physical assets can only be in one place at one time. Intangible assets, by contrast, can usually be used over
and over, in multiple places at the same time. For example, once you’ve written the Starbucks operating manual
in Chinese, an investment in organizational development, you can use it in each of the country’s 1,200-plus
stores. The costs of developing the app Angry Birds, an investment in software, can be spread over an
arbitrarily large number of downloads. Once a business has created or acquired an intangible asset, it can make
use of it again and again at relatively little cost, compared to most physical assets.
Sunk costs
If a business makes an intangible investment and later on decides it wants to back out, it’s often hard to reverse
the decision and try to get back the investment’s cost by selling the created asset – and, in general, it’s harder
than in the case of a tangible asset. Economists describe these kinds of irrecoverable costs as “sunk”. For
example, if a logistics company goes bankrupt its creditors can sell transport vans and warehouses to pay off its
4

outstanding debts. These assets can be put to use in different companies and/or different industries and there is
often an active and liquid market that trades in them. But creditors might find it more difficult to sell intangible
assets such as specialised logistics software or the firm’s brand name.
Spillovers
Some intangible investments have unusually high spillovers, that is to say, it is relatively easy for other
businesses to take advantage of intangible investments they don’t themselves make. The classic example is
R&D. Copying other people’s ideas is relatively easy, unless the law prevents it by means of patents or
copyrights. In the language of economists, the ideas created by R&D are non-rival; my using a piece of
knowledge doesn’t prevent you from also using it. In Thomas Jefferson’s words, “He who receives an idea from
me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without
darkening me.” (Lipscomb and Bergh, 1905).
But spillovers don’t just arise from R&D. After Apple released the iPhone, almost all smartphones started looking
just like it. Apple’s investments in software, design, and supply chains were adopted or imitated by its
competitors as they sought to create phones like Apple’s. This is an example of marketing spillovers. Perhaps
less obviously, there are also spillovers in organizational design, training, and branding and marketing.
Synergies
Ideas and other ideas go well together. This is especially true in the field of technology. For example, the
microwave oven relied on technology that was invented by the British in the Second World War as part of the
radar defences pioneered to defend its shores. Intangible investments, in particular information technologies
and especially networked computers and smartphones, also show synergies with tangible assets. For example,
in the 1990s Walmart used computers and software to reorganize their supply chains, improves efficiency and
lower prices. It used organisational and business practices in combination with new technologies to improve
productivity.

Trends in the economy as a whole
As discussed above, these intangibles are not counted in company accounts so we cannot get comprehensive
data for a company. But we can for economies as a whole. To do so, we have to use some detective work to
find them out, relying on various surveys (e.g. training surveys), input-output tables and the fact that national
accounts include some intangibles. When we do this, what do we find?
These data are drawn from the work I have done with Carol Corrado, Cecilia Jona-Lasinio and Massimiliano
Iommi that have produced harmonized2 national estimates that include the United States, called the
INTAN-Invest dataset3, covering the economies of 20 European countries and the United States up to 2016.

Let’s start with the United States (US) and Europe where Europe is the following EU countries for whom we
have data: Austria (AT), Germany (DE), Denmark (DK), Spain (ES), Finland (FI), France (FR), Italy (IT),
Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), and United Kingdom (UK). Figures 1 and 2 show data for these countries for
which we have a broader set of measures on intangible investment. Figure 3 displays a wider group of countries
for an extended cross-country comparison.
Figure 1 shows data on the intangible and tangible investment shares of aggregate value added in Europe and
the United States. As may be seen, intangible investment overtook tangible investment before the global
financial crisis, during which intangible investment fell comparatively less than tangible investment. Figure 2
breaks out the investment shares for Europe versus the United States. The US intangibles share is higher and
more variable than the aggregate share for our 10 European (EU) countries. In the EU countries, though
intangibles are less, the intangible investment share is steadily increasing. The tangible share declines, on
balance, in both areas. Figure 1 and 2 tell us that at the level of the macroeconomy intangible investment is a
big deal, and that the economies of Europe and US have shifted significantly towards these type of investments
over the last few decades.

There is a good deal of variation across countries as shown in Figure 3 which shows the tangible and intangible
investment shares of GDP (adjusted to include intangibles) for the 20 INTAN-Invest economies averaged over
years before and after the global financial crisis (1996 to 2007) and (2008 to 2016) (tangible investment
excludes residential structures). Intangible shares of GDP vary from 6 and 7 percent to 15 and 16 percent for
the two lowest and two highest in the latter period. The US and Sweden are consistently high. Intangible shares
are slightly higher after the crisis, but tangible shares are mostly down. Figure 3 is sorted left to right by the
7

intangible share of output. This highlights that the lower intangible share economies are also the higher tangible
share economies (e.g. Slovakia), and that the inclusion of intangible investment lowers the coefficient of
variation4 of countries investment ratios to GDP.

Some implications
There are at least three major avenues through which I think the secular increase in intangible capital matters
for the economy and policymakers. These are: the measurement of investment and capital, how intangibly
intensive firms finance5 themselves, and finally implications for capacity constraints.6 Today, I’d like focus on the
first of these implications although I think the other implications are very important and still somewhat open
questions.
So, turning to measurement and without knowing anything about the economic properties of intangibles, one
can right away get some feel for how they change things by looking at the accounting definitions of value added
and profits.
Measuring and decomposing output
Value added
To count the output of an economy producing steel and cars you might think of adding up the production of all
the steel and all the cars. That would, of course, be wrong since the value of the cars includes some of the
steel. What Value Added (or GDP) does is to subtract any inputs that get used up and transformed in the
process of production, these are called intermediate inputs, and this overcomes the issue of double counting.
That raises the question of what is and isn’t an intermediate. Steel sounds like it is in this example but suppose
the car company develops software such as a navigation system, for example. This same software can be used
for many cars over many years and is by no means used up. The software is, therefore, a produced capital
good not an intermediate input and so it should be included in value added. The car company produces both a
car and a software factory.
Wages and profits
The creation of value added requires inputs, which economists and statistical organisations typically separate
into capital and labour. The following relation between value added and payments to those inputs holds as an
identity:
𝑝𝑣 𝑉 = 𝑝𝐿 𝐿 + 𝑝𝑘 𝐾 + 𝜋

(1)

𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

The coefficient of variation (
), for the 2008-2016 period excluding intangible investment is 0.27, including intangible capital
𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛
brings the ratio down to 0.17.
5
For example, intangible capital is difficult to value and collateralise which affects risk premiums and the balance of finance between debt
and equity.
6
Intangible capital is scalable and less likely to run into short run capacity constraints.

On the left we have measured nominal value added, 𝑝𝑣 𝑉, where 𝑝𝑣 and 𝑉 are the price and volume of value
added respectively. On the right are the payments to labour (L) and capital (K). For the purposes of this section
let us call 𝑝𝐿 , the rental cost of labour, the wage (we are ignoring taxes and subsidies and the self-employed).
What about payments to capital? Let us suppose that capital potentially earns two types of returns. First,
owners of capital make a return that, in a competitive market, compensates them for the risks and expenses
incurred in owing capital. For example, airlines need to hire labour but also operate aircraft. In a competitive
market 𝑝𝑘 𝐾 is the costs they have to incur to operate that capital K. Secondly, if markets are not competitive,
due to barriers to entry for an airline route say, firms might make money over and above what they have to pay
to operate their planes. This is the 𝜋 term and we shall call this ‘pure profit’ above production costs.
We shall return to this below, but it turns out to be very hard to measure 𝜋 independently. Thus for now, let us
assume we measure 𝑝𝑣 𝑉 and 𝑝𝐿 𝐿 and then ascribe all the rest to the firm’s tangible capital payments, this
means we can write:
𝑉
𝑝𝑣 𝑉 = 𝑝𝐿 𝐿 + 𝑝𝑘,𝑇
𝐾𝑇

(2)

𝑣
Where we subscript 𝑝𝑘,𝑇
and 𝐾 with a T to denote tangible capital and therefore intangibles are being excluded.

Where do intangibles fit in? When we include intangibles we add two things. First, we have a new and higher
value added, 𝑝𝑄 𝑄 : the company producing the cars is producing value added in both cars and also software.
Second, we have more capital 𝐾𝐼 , since there is a capital stock of software. Thus we define:
𝑄
𝑄
𝑝𝑄 𝑄 = 𝑝𝐿 𝐿 + 𝑝𝑘,𝑇
𝐾𝑇 + 𝑝𝑘,𝐼
𝐾𝐼

(3)

It should be immediately obvious that the conventional measurements might give a misleading picture of the
economy. Compare, for example, the capital shares under each measure 𝑄 and 𝑉 which we can write as:
𝑉
𝑝𝑘,𝑇
𝐾𝑇
𝑝𝑣 𝑉

(4)

𝑄
𝑄
𝑝𝑘,𝑇
𝐾𝑇 + 𝑝𝑘,𝐼
𝐾𝐼
𝑝𝑄 𝑄

(5)

𝑠𝐾,𝑉 =
𝑠𝐾,𝑄 =

Both the numerator and denominator have changed in equation (5) and so when we account for intangibles it’s
not clear if the capital share has risen or not. However, because payments to labour (𝑝𝑙 𝐿) remain the same and
𝑝𝑄 𝑄 is greater than 𝑝𝑉 𝑉, it is in fact the case that the capital share rises when intangibles are included. What is
not clear is how the trends in the two calculated shares in equations (4) and (5) differ over time.
Rental prices and asset prices
We now go further by digging deeper into just what 𝑝𝑘,𝑇 and 𝑝𝑘,𝐼 actually are. In the GDP identity we want to put
capital and labour on an equal footing. Now, on the left hand side is the nominal value of output, which is a flow
9

of value added produced over the year. What is the relevant flow of payments to labour and capital on the right
hand side? It is the flow of payments to use those factors for a year. Now, for workers this is straightforward. It
is the cost of hiring them over a year. For capital, it is the equivalent: the cost of hiring capital for a year, or what
is called the rental cost of capital. The reason for trying to be clear about this is that capital often has two prices
and not one, a rental price and an asset price. For example, I can buy a van outright for my business with the
price I pay being the asset price, 𝑝𝑎 , or I can rent a van for a year, at a given and presumably lower price 𝑝𝑘 .
What we need is the rental price and not the asset price. There is, however, a link between the two prices
derived in a now famous work by economists Robert Hall and Dale Jorgenson (1967). Suppose you are a hire
car company who buys a car for a price 𝑝𝑎 , and then has to decide how much to rent it out for. That rental price
would have to cover at least two things. First, you could have done something else with the money such as
putting it in some other project, for example, and earning a return 𝜌. Second, the rental will have to cover any
change in the value over the rental period (depreciation, 𝛿). In a well-functioning market then, the rental price
has to equal these two factors so that:
𝑝𝑘 = 𝑝𝑎 (𝜌 + 𝛿)

(6)

Now let us substitute equation (6) into equation (4) and (5) to get:
𝑝𝑎,𝑇 (𝜌𝑉 + 𝛿𝑇 ) 𝐾𝑇
𝑝𝑣 𝑉

(7)

𝑝𝑎,𝑇 (𝜌𝑄 + 𝛿𝑇 ) 𝐾𝑇 + 𝑝𝑎,𝐼 (𝜌𝑄 + 𝛿𝐼 ) 𝐾𝐼
𝑝𝑄 𝑄

(8)

𝑠𝐾,𝑉 =
𝑠𝐾,𝑄 =

Consider the top equation (7) and suppose 𝑝𝑎,𝑇 , 𝛿𝑇 and

𝐾
𝑉

are stable. Mechanically, a rise in 𝑠𝐾,𝑉 must be

accompanied by a rise in 𝜌𝑉 . Now looking at equation (8), a rise in 𝑠𝐾,𝑄 might be accompanied by a rise in
𝜌𝑄 but it is also possible that a rise in 𝐾𝐼 , especially if 𝐾𝐼 has a high 𝛿𝐼 , accounts for that rise so that 𝜌 stays the
same.
Some evidence from the US and UK
We want to calculate these terms to see if 𝑠𝑘 and 𝜌 are changing, and to what extent the inclusion7 of
intangibles changes our interpretation. We can do this using our INTAN-Invest dataset. Figure 4 shows these
values calculated for the US and UK. In the case of the US we see that the capital share of national income
(Panel A) has been rising over time, just slightly less than 8 percentage points between 1998-2016 when
excluding intangible investment or 5 percentage points when including it. This rise in the capital share as we’ve
learnt could come from a number of sources: substitution from labour to capital, increasing depreciation rates or
increasing returns (profits). Panel B helps shed some light on this by plotting an estimate of 𝜌 over the same
period for the US where intangibles are included and excluded. Interestingly, we see that the conclusions one
would reach about the rise in the labour share are significantly affected by the inclusion of intangibles. When
intangibles are omitted one could account for the rising capital income share as almost entirely a rise in 𝜌, that

Note national accounts now include some intangibles like R&D. For example R&D has been capitalised and included in the UK national
accounts since 2014. Figure 4 excludes all intangibles and compares the results to output figures that incorporate a wider range of
intangibles than available in national accounts.

is, returns unrelated to the cost of purchasing capital goods and their depreciation. In the intangible case,
however, this result is negated as these higher returns are brought down by payments to the intangible stock of
capital. Turning to the UK (panels C and D), things are different. The capital income share in both cases is
relatively flat and appears to have declined somewhat from the late nineties and this is similar for the measured
rates of return.
Figure 4 - Capital income shares and rates of return for the US and UK

Note: Capital income shares are calculated in accordance with equations (4) and (5). Rates of return 𝜌 are the
implied rates of return based on equations (7) and (8). Results are for the market sector only and further exclude
the real estate and agriculture sector. In the dashed line that excludes intangibles, all intangibles are excluded
including intangibles now incorporated in official national accounts. More methodological details are available in
Corrado, Jager and Jona-Lasinio, (2016). Last data point is 2016.

Mark-ups
The flat returns depicted in Figure 4 and flat capital shares for the UK seem to be at some contrast to a growing
literature8 that suggests that mark-ups have risen dramatically over past decades. So, what is going on? 9 A
mark-up is defined as a good’s price relative to its marginal production costs, where the marginal cost (MC) for a
firm is the cost to them of creating an additional incremental unit.

𝜇=

𝑝𝑦
𝑀𝐶

(9)

That cost is not easy to calculate because it depends crucially on your definition of incremental. For a
conventional factory trying to accommodate week-by-week changes in demand incremental might mean, for
example, the cost of extra production when workers work overtime. In the longer run, such a firm can
presumably adjust both hours of work and the capacity of the factory in which case incremental would be costs
of adding another team of workers on a new production line. For the software company the short-run costs of
selling another unit is essentially zero since any number of users can simply download the program but in the
medium term software companies typically have to rewrite versions of their software in which case the costs are
not zero.

Direct observation of marginal costs is therefore difficult and so the economics profession has gone about it in
different ways. One method is to use company data and compare, by using statistical methods, the
(proportional) change in output across a sample of firms with their (proportional) change in inputs. Economic
theory tells you that such a change equals the mark-up multiplied by the share of that input in total costs and if
one knows the share, again from the accounts, one can work out the mark-up. Since this lecture is supposed to
be of a relatively non-technical nature I hope my audience will forgive me if I defer the discussion of the
technical details of this procedure to another day. Suffice it to say a big issue in this work is the extent to which
such procedures fully measure the range of costs that should be regarded as incremental. If some are left out of
the analysis it might over-attribute explanatory power to those left in, leading to possibly erroneous measures of
mark-ups and inferences concerning the evolution of market power. As we have seen, many intangibles are
omitted from company accounts so intangibles seems like a plausible omitted variable.
Doing a little more theory, a standard relation in microeconomics is that the ratio of average cost (AC) to
marginal costs equals returns to scale 𝛼:

𝛼=

8
9

𝐴𝐶
𝑀𝐶

(10)

See De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017), Hall (2018) for US or Aquilante et al (2019) for UK.
See Syverson (2019) for a detailed consideration and explanation around these trends.
12

𝐶

Substituting in equation (9) and noting 𝐴𝐶 = , we redefine scale as:
𝑌

𝛼=𝜇

𝐶
𝑝𝑦 𝑌

(11)

where C is the total costs of production, 𝑝𝑦 is the output price and Y is output. Now those costs of production are
the costs of labour and capital (tangible and intangible) that are incurred in production, and in the approach
above, we assumed that such costs equalled revenues. If firms are making additional revenues above
production costs we can add this to equation (11) and write an equation for the mark-up over marginal
production costs as:
𝜇=

𝛼
1 − 𝑠𝜋

where 𝑠𝜋 is the share of revenue that is profit above the costs of production, 𝑠𝜋 =

(12)

𝜋
𝑝𝑣 𝑉

. Equation (12) says that

large mark-ups are reflected, other things equal, in large 𝑠𝜋 , or that firms with high economies of scale 𝛼, again
other things equal, will make high mark-ups. This seems consistent with the intangibles story.
Ongoing intangible activities such as software development, research and process innovation can all produce
considerable returns to scale. Therefore, these measured mark-ups could be reflecting a rise in the mean level
of returns to scale. However, a rise large enough to account for the dramatic rise in mark-ups measured in, for
example, De Loecker et al (2018) seems unlikely at the level of the macroeconomy and has not been measured
to date.
Other intangible activities like marketing and brand management while not increasing scale may lead to higher
market and pricing power and so greater 𝑠𝜋 . Indeed, a fairly large rise in 𝑠𝜋 has been reported in the US by
Barkai (2016) 10. Does this increased 𝑠𝜋 represent ‘pure profits’? Consider branding, a firm’s brand or reputation
may enable it to charge a mark-up and provide the appearance of abnormal profits. However, if firms incur costs
to maintain their position in the market and these costs, on average, are just enough to cover the costs incurred
(e.g. advertising costs and branding) to generate the higher 𝑠𝜋 , then branding costs exhaust the 𝑠𝜋 and so no
pure profits show up. This is part of the reason Nestlé paid more than three time the tangible value of Rowntree
to acquire it. When these intangible activities are fully capitalised, however, overall returns remain flat. It should
be emphasised this is an average result and potentially hides particular cases in particular industries.
Trends in Investment
In a recent talk (Haskel, 2018), I emphasised the importance of understanding investment and highlighted its
recent weakness in the UK. I argued that the recent weakness could largely be due to Brexit uncertainty but at
different points since the financial crisis weak UK investment has also been a concern, see McCafferty (2014) or
Cunliffe (2017). This has also been an issue in the US and the focus of recent work by Crouzet and Eberly
(2018) who try to understand weak capital investment and changes to market structure in the US in the context

10

Barkai (2016) documented a rise in this ratio of 3 to 16 percent of national income for the US between 1980 and 2016.
13

of intangibles. Their analysis demonstrates that intangible capital, when treated as an omitted factor in
production, can fill a substantial part of the apparent gap11 left by weak physical capital investment. The effect
was more pronounced for more intangibly intense sectors and firms.
Turning to UK data, Table 3 provides some evidence of their findings for the UK. Here the changes in the
investment to capital stock by industry between the period 1998-2007 and 2010-2016 are shown on a tangible
only basis and then with the inclusion of and capitalisation of intangibles. Firstly, it should be noted that all
sectors seem to experience a reduction in the ratio of investment to the capital stock and even with the inclusion
of intangibles. Looking at the total line, for the aggregate economy, intangibles appear to be part of the story but
not all of it.
More interesting results, as Crouzet and Eberly (2018) found, are at the sector level. Table 3 is sorted by
intangible intensity defined as the ratio of intangible investment to total investment over the period 1998-2007.
Intangibly intense industries like Professional and Scientific (M) services and Information and Communication
(J) have noticeably smaller changes once intangibles are included, and generally across industries the ratios fall
by less with the inclusion of intangibles. This is illustrated in Figure 5 where the values nearly all sit above zero.
Figure 5 also demonstrates the positive correlation between the intangible intensity of a sector and the
difference in the measured slow-down of investment when you include intangibles. A notable exception is
financial and insurance activities (K), a sector that has exerted a large drag on UK productivity growth, see for
example Tenreyro (2018). This short analysis highlights, I think, the importance of closely monitoring intangible
forms of investment, particularly in the context of productivity analysis where future productivity gains in
advanced economies are likely to be increasingly driven by intangible investment.

These investment gaps are defined by aggregating actual versus expected investment at the firm level where expected investment is
calculated using a mix of firm specific characteristics and financial market fundamentals.

Note: Figure shows the difference of difference in the pre (1998-2007) and post
financial crisis (2010-2016) average investment to capital stock ratios by industry
with and without intangibles. A positive value implies that the ratio fell by less or
grew more when intangibles are capitalised and included in the calculation. See
Table 3 for industry codes and descriptions. The blue line is the line of best fit.

Conclusion
Today, I have outlined the long term trend away from an economy of tangible capital to one of intangible capital
and how the categories and characteristics of intangible capital differ from tangible capital. It is a pleasure to
have done so here in York where Rowntree used both tangible and intangible assets to successfully sell its
products.
It is incumbent on economists to incorporate and understand this trend and assess whether our current models
can capture the implications. I have focused on and outlined some of the challenges to measurement and
highlighted where the omission of the measurement of intangible capital plays a role in active debates amongst
policy makers concerning trends in margins, mark-ups, scale and investment.
I would reiterate that measurement is not the only channel we as policymakers need to pay close attention to.
For example, in my discussion of mark-ups I decomposed the mark-up into a scale component and a profit
component, both are variables that could interact with and change the dynamics of output, wages and inflation. I
also believe that through its intangible nature there are implications for the financing of business investment,
particularly for new firms. Firms may have to shift more to equity financing and venture capital, while lenders
may rely more on earnings-based loan covenants and less on collateral. There are implications for financial
stability and monetary policy transmission but the overall balance of direction is not clear. This is an area for
future research.
Finally, let me thank you gain for your hospitality and Ken Dixon for supporting this lecture series.
