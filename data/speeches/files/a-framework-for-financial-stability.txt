A Framework for Financial Stability
1.

Introduction
i)

Vulnerabilities in Financial Stability

It is clear that rapid growth in size, complexity, and diversity of global financial
markets has added new dimensions and challenges to the process of maintaining
financial stability.
Traditional concerns remain that unwise credit exposure can result in insolvency, and
systemic instability. But today there are a new series of hazards. Credit risk transfer
has introduced new holders of credit risk, such as hedge funds and insurance
companies, at a time when market depth is untested. Systemically significant issues
could increasingly arise from market related risks, or from single point of failure risks
in the market infrastructure as ever greater volumes of transactions pass through.
Equally the growth of derivative instruments and advent of a range of new asset
classes, despite added dispersion and better risk management, have added to the risk
of instability arising through leverage, volatility and opacity. No wonder that those
involved in financial stability work have much to think about!
ii)

Introducing a Framework for Financial Stability

The purpose of my remarks today is not to analyse these threats. Instead I want to
discuss how to approach some of the challenging issues faced by many central banks
as we seek to decide how best to organise our work and to allocate resources in order
to promote financial stability.
We need to be clear, accountable and transparent as to how we devote our resources
in this area. And just as the financial system becomes more complex, so the
judgements as to what we do and what we do not do are increasingly difficult. That is
why we need a framework – a set of organising principles – that enables us to provide
context and understanding to our endeavours, to provide a source of focus and rigour
to our approach, and to motivate our people.

4
The issues are, I believe, of general application. Though you will forgive me I am
sure if I start by looking at the framework within which the Bank of England, as a
non-regulatory central bank with a remit for system-wide stability, addresses the
vulnerabilities.
2.

Challenges in Creating a Framework
i)

Monetary Policy

I want to start by considering the governance of the Bank’s accompanying mandate,
the conduct of monetary policy. This highlights the clarity of our accountability in
the monetary policy arena. In line with many central banks, we have a mandate in
statute – the Bank of England Act – to conduct monetary policy. The Government
sets a target inflation level which we are required to meet.
Importantly we – and you – can see how we are performing month by month in
relation to our mandate. We also have a tested analytical framework. We model
possible future outcomes and we look at the balance of risks around a central view.
We can rely on experience and judgement to make regular policy decisions. And we
can alter our policy decision on interest rates each month as the data and
circumstances evolve.
ii)

Financial Stability and why it is different

If financial instability occurs, costs to society may be high. Damage to our reputation
could be potentially high too. Yet judging the optimal amount of resources to devote
to prevent crises is problematic. What degree of resilience do we want? And what
should we be prepared to pay for insurance? This is a familiar problem in public
policy – what is the optimal size of the fire brigade or army?
The challenges we face in seeking to maintain financial stability are very different to
those in the monetary policy arena.
•

Firstly there is neither a clear over-arching analytical framework nor a
commonly agreed set of indicators of incipient financial instabilities.

5
•

Secondly the task is made harder because we are dealing with tail events – low
probability scenarios – rather than central projections. It is about aberrant
rather than normal behaviour and situations: less predictable and harder to
model.

•

Thirdly there are a number of different potential policy instruments that can
affect the financial environment in various, sometimes conflicting, ways. And
by no means are all in the hands of central banks

•

Fourthly national financial stability responsibilities are often shared. In the
UK we work with Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and the Financial Services
Authority (FSA). For cross-border activities we operate alongside overseas
central banks and supervisors.

•

Fifthly although the roles of the UK authorities are outlined and published in a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), this gives little guidance as to what
financial stability is or a clearly identifiable target.

•

And lastly it is harder to get motivational feedback – unless in unwelcome
form should a crisis occur.

3.

Defining Our Role in Financial Stability Oversight

These factors pose a number of challenges in defining our role in financial stability
oversight – what activities should we as a central bank undertake? To make these
decisions, firstly we should identify the main functions that need to be performed in
each jurisdiction to promote financial stability. Then we can look at the Bank’s own
institutional mandate. And finally we can determine the most appropriate way to
fulfil it.
i)

The Three Essential Functions for Public Authorities

There seem to me to be three essential functions to be carried out in securing financial
stability: I think this is the case in most jurisdictions. Firstly, there are the roles
relating to supervision of firms and markets where financial instability could arise.
Secondly, there is the oversight of the financial system as a whole - the systemic
issues which could impinge on society. And thirdly there is the fiscal underpinning
which may exceptionally be required to restore confidence in the event of failure.

6
The fiscal underpinning is a role for Ministries of Finance. The other roles can either
be combined institutionally or separated. I am sure each model is represented here
today. In the UK, HMT has responsibility for the fiscal underpinning, FSA for the
supervision of firms and market regulation, and the Bank of England for the stability
of the system as a whole.
ii)

The “Must Dos” for the Bank of England

The roles as such are set out with slightly more precision in the MoU, and it is from
there that we start on our quest to decide what initiatives we – the Bank of England –
should undertake, and how far we go with each. The MoU highlights three “must
dos” for the Bank. I expect that these are similar in many central banks. They really
define our mandate.
a)

Assessment of Threats to Financial Stability

Firstly we need to assess the threats to the financial system. We need to be in a
position to inform ourselves and to advise HMT at all times on the implications for
UK financial stability of developments in both the domestic and international market
places. We do this by continually assessing threats to the system as a whole –
“oversight of the systemic conjuncture” if you like.
So we look beyond the risks in relation to individual institutions, to the aggregate
problems that can arise: through networks and single points of failure; through
dependencies and interdependencies of firms and markets. In other words to areas
where, if market forces and market participants are left to their own devices, problems
could threaten the stability of the system. This means that we need to have our finger
on the pulse and to maintain regular contact with key firms and infrastructure
providers. Market intelligence is vital in this area: it is not enough to read about
issues, we need to be learning about them first hand from key players and analysing
our findings from a financial stability perspective.
The FSA also shares responsibilities in this area. They too will be asked for advice by
HMT. Their starting point is the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses in the
individual institutions and markets they supervise, and the potential consequences of
problems or failures at individual institutions.

7

An important factor for the Bank relates to London’s position as a major financial
centre. Although our specific focus and interest is the systemic conjuncture as it
affects the UK, possibilities of contagion in an increasingly global market mean that
we have to be alert equally to developments in global capital and financial markets.
And it means we have to understand the dynamics and interrelationships of markets;
how new products work; and the possible behaviour patterns of intermediaries,
investors, and borrowers. Above all we need to be focused on where major risks are
most likely to emerge and the market dynamics if those risks start to crystallise. And
we need to distinguish those which are systemic from a myriad of fascinating
developments, many of which are just “noise” but which could otherwise distract us.
b)

Risk Reduction: Oversight of Payment Systems

The second area where we, and typically other central banks, are required to perform
is oversight of payment systems. Payment systems facilitate economic transactions of
goods, services and financial assets and are an essential component of a well
functioning financial system. So reduction of risks in these systems, for example
through the introduction of our Real Time Gross Settlement system, is clearly a
priority from a systemic perspective.
c)

Provision of Liquidity and Preparation for a Financial Crisis

And thirdly the MoU stipulates that we need to be in a position to inject liquidity at all
times. This means that we must be able to provide liquidity in normal times, as well
as in times of stress or crisis. This puts an increased onus on well developed and
tested crisis management plans, and a particular focus on ensuring that we are able to
undertake a range of official financial operations in exceptional circumstances.
4.

Financial Stability: Parallel Processes

Recognition of these three “must do” areas is a starting point in deciding the scope of
our financial stability work and in enabling us to fulfil our MoU mandate. But it does
not provide a clear steer on what we actually have to do to carry out our functions
efficiently and effectively. Regarding long term thinking, which might one day lead
to an analogue to monetary policy, we are undertaking a research project. This is

8
separate from our day to day activities where a set of organising principles can be
used operationally to handle today’s issues.
i)

Research and Development: Creation of an Analytical Framework

The research project is an attempt to devise an analytical framework as an analogue to
that in monetary policy: to help clarify some of the differences I outlined earlier and
to provide greater certainty and focus. As with the development of monetary
frameworks, this will be a medium to long-term endeavour. This may sound
overambitious. But even modest achievements towards it would enhance
understanding of what financial stability oversight is about, and what our priorities
should be in seeking to ensure it. And so it could assist our quest for clearer
accountability and more transparent governance arrangements.
This quest gets to issues such as how to define our financial stability objective, how to
articulate indicators of financial stability, and how they relate to each other. It
provides the possibility of calibrating systemic risk and developing tools that could
potentially be deployed to reduce such risk, and will include scenario analysis and
macro-stress testing.
In reality, it is unlikely we will converge on a single model which captures systemic
risk in its entirety. But by developing and calibrating a suite of models we hope to
make some progress towards gauging fragilities and frictions in the financial system
better – how likely they are to arise; on what they depend; and, ultimately, what preemptive mitigating action might be feasible. This could put financial stability
analysis on a more similar analytical footing to monetary policy – albeit with a greater
amount of uncertainty regarding eventual outcomes.
With time we can review the outputs of this research work. We can then
operationalise those that are relevant and robust to help decide our ongoing activities.
In other words, the outputs of this R&D activity could become inputs to prioritising
our day-to-day risk reduction activities.

9
ii)

Ongoing Activities: Organising Principles

In the meantime we have to address the real risks of today. How are priorities to be
set? Financial stability is an area where there are so many things we could do. So we
need to have a set of organising principles to help us prioritise and focus. I’d like to
describe the process we go through in addressing the difficult decisions – how much
to do, and how far to go.
One could make a case for a huge empire of threat assessment on the basis that
seemingly remote events or threats could crystallise into a financial crisis. For
example, what resources would it have taken to foresee that default of the Russian
government on its debt in 1998 would, through a complex chain of events, eventually
result in the failure of the hedge-fund Long Term Capital Management in New York?
A failure which importantly was judged as having wider significance. Equally what
resources could it be wise to devote to assess what implications, if any, the
downgrades of GM’s and Ford’s debt this month might mean for the financial sector
and ultimately for financial stability.
Alternatively one might take a hardline view that unless an activity falls fairly and
squarely, in the short run, into one of the “must do” categories, it should be
discontinued. For example, we could in theory simply ignore risk emanating from
overseas – even in an international financial centre like the UK – on the expectation
(or hope) that others would take care of these risks on our behalf.
Common sense suggests that the answer lies somewhere between the two. But
difficult judgements are involved. So we have to devise a rigorous process to
scrutinise our actions. A valuable approach is to set out the practical actions we
intend to achieve – the “outcomes” or “deliverables” – and then to challenge them.
We do this from two points of view.
Firstly we need to be clear why we are pursuing a particular deliverable. Is it a
market failure justifying any intervention at all? What real impact will the work have
on fulfilling our mandate? How closely does it relate to the “must dos”?

10
Secondly we need to think through the costs, benefits and risks associated with the
action from the points of view of both likelihood and impact. What will be the risks
to society, the economy and even the Bank if we do not do it? How might these risks
be reduced if we do do it? How well placed are we to do it as opposed to others?
How confident are we of achieving the intended deliverables – particularly when we
need to rely on others? Do we have influence to ensure action is taken?
The answers – difficult as they may be to define – help us in prioritising and resource
allocation; and provide sunset provisioning in deciding whether to continue with
particular strands of work.
5.

Ongoing Activities: The Matrix

i)
Uses for the Matrix
There are many types of activity, and many sources of threat where we could be
active. So we need organising principles to make sense of where particular actions fit
into the landscape of our financial stability work. It is only then that we can evaluate
competing priorities, by subjecting each “bid” to a common set of challenges. To do
this we find it helps to use a simple matrix. This adds objectivity to what is in many
senses a subjective process. Here is an example:
MATRIX: ORGANISING PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY

Credit Risk
Activities
Assessment of Threats to
Financial Stability
Risk Reduction
Preparation for and
Managing a Financial Crisis

Sources of Threat
Market
Infrastructure
and
(including
Liquidity
Payment
Risk
Systems)

International
Architecture

11
The matrix is a common sense map, which enables us to visualise why something is
being done, and where it fits into the overall financial stability effort. The specific
activities and deliverables that are located in each of the boxes can be scrutinised to see
if they meet our objectives or if they should be discontinued.
This helps us decide on the level of resource and the nature and qualities of people we
need. It also helps with budgeting, and provides a basis for motivating good
performance.
To explain the relevance of the boxes let us look first at the columns: sources of threat.
Our desired end objective is to promote financial stability by seeking to prevent threats
from crystallising, or at least to reduce their impact. Then we will look at the rows –
the different types of activity we undertake: the means if you will to achieve our ends.
ii)

Sources of Threat

First, the columns: the sources of threat.
a)

Credit Risk

Financial crises have traditionally arisen where the solvency of one or more institutions
either crumbles, or is perceived to be in danger of doing so, in a way that threatens the
financial system. So we need to focus on credit concentrations, credit aspects of
prudential standards, credit pricing and terms etc. We need data and intelligence to do
that. Understanding credit conditions and vulnerabilities is quite well developed
territory. But new threats have arisen, particularly from sophisticated credit transfer
instruments. This is a tricky and opaque arena. It is hard to know where concentrations
of credit risk actually reside and even where credit risk ends and market risk begins. In
addition there is the increasing range of participants who are also taking on credit risk.
Of course in addition to this we can – and do – think about credit risk standards like
Basel II. We focus on the systemic aspects of prudential design since in the UK FSA
focuses on supervisory issues.

12
b)

Market and Liquidity Risk

As the global capital market has expanded on the back of securitisation and
derivatives increasing vulnerabilities arise. Change has been so rapid and
development so fast that it has been hard for any of us to keep up. Given the
multitude of new instruments and new markets that have appeared and the resulting
increase in risk, this is a significant area of work for us.
There is of course much to be done in understanding the complex interdependencies
and concentrations, and how these might impact on financial stability.
So we need data and market intelligence in this area. And we need to improve our
ability to make ex-ante judgements about the possible behaviour of both investors and
intermediaries, as well as the potential depth of markets. Equally we need to be sure
we would have relevant information and understanding of markets and agents should
problems arise.
c)

Infrastructure (Including Payment Systems)

Focus is also important in the field of payment, clearing and settlement systems.
Historically payment systems were primarily domestic entities, but as markets have
become more globalised so too has the underlying infrastructure. This has helped to
enhance efficiency, but leads also to added network or “single point of failure” risks.
As 9/11 showed, when problems arise in this area liquidity injection may be needed to
prevent market or institutional failure, and risks of instability to the financial system
could mount swiftly.
This brings us to one of our “must dos” – oversight of payment systems. Based on
adequate data and understanding we work here on: enhancing interoperability,
strengthening risk management, strengthening business continuity resilience, and
improving governance.
d)

International Architecture

International architecture and emerging markets exposures are a broad arena where
there are particular risks and complexities which lead us to look at it separately. In
response to the wider environment, constant adaptation is needed both of the

13
architecture itself and the institutions within it, such as the IMF. In terms of our quest
for financial stability, this focuses specifically on sovereign debt, crisis prevention
and resolution. Progress has been made since the Asian Crisis, but significantly more
is needed to build on the emerging elements of the exceptional access framework, and
the Fund’s lending-into-arrears policy, but also Collective Action Clauses, and the
recently devised Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in
Emerging Markets.
In using the matrix to categorise sources of threat there are of course a number of
ways one could cut the cake. Credit exposure to emerging sovereign debtors for
example can appear in the “credit” and “international architecture” boxes.
iii)

Activities

Now we can move to the rows. To use the matrix as a location device to focus our
efforts, decide on deliverables and enhance our resource allocation, we need to create
the “boxes” by considering the types of activity we could undertake to address each
main source of threat – the rows.
a)

Assessment of Threats

Firstly we need to evaluate threats to the system. We need a process of data
collection and assessment to analyse information and market intelligence from
multiple sources. This “horizon scanning” enables us to get early warning of how and
where threats could appear.
We cannot do all this without knowing how markets work. Typically we obtain
intelligence about what is going on from a number of sources, including a group of
experienced staff who are operationally active in financial markets. We then evaluate
and assess the threats from this intelligence. This needs people who are motivated to
think through and identify new aspects of risk and threats, who can move with
intellectual agility and flexibility between risks as they arise. This enables in turn
high level management to judge the risk and allocate resources accordingly for risk
reduction – as well as stopping work if threats no longer seem relevant.

14
A key challenge here is distinguishing between slow burn issues (such as a gradual
shift towards more exotic financial instruments) and the more immediate issues
relating to, say, the prospect of a major market default. In each case it is important to
understand the potential threats to financial stability: but the timescales and tools are
different. The matrix helps to start the process.
Above all we have to clarify the types of threats we are looking for. An issue here is
the risk of “missing something”. Not acting on something seemingly minor may have
significant consequences for financial stability and costs compared to the resource
saved by ignoring it. So the stakes are high in getting this right – though we need
here to be realistic as particularly in the early stages the significance of developments
can be hard to read.
b)

Risk Reduction

Secondly, risk reduction or mitigation. Here we seek to make the financial system
more resilient. This is the world of risk management, prudential standards, liquidity
standards, resilience of payment systems etc. It can involve the promotion of codes
and standards over a wide field ranging from accounting to improving legal certainty,
and management of countries’ external balance sheets.
Decision making about priorities is particularly challenging because we cannot be
clear ex-ante how well the mitigation techniques will work, and we often need to rely
on others to implement them. In addition we need to ask whether we are the right
party to act.
We also need to think about the relevance of our activities to our mandate – or “must
dos”. In some areas, for example payment systems – one of our “must dos” – it is
clear that we have a responsibility to reduce risks. In this case the questions we need
to answer relate to the degree, methods and resource implications.
But in other areas whether we should act is less clear cut. What particular
contributions can we make and are there any areas where we can sensibly act alone?
We need to ascertain areas where we can achieve results both domestically with HMT

15
and FSA, and internationally with organisations such as the Basel Committee, the
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Financial Stability Forum.
Perhaps I can mention one area to which the challenge process suggests we should
devote considerable resources – global institutional liquidity. As I have said before
this is an area of potential vulnerability that has developed alongside the rapid
globalisation of markets and of firms operating within them. I personally feel that it
has been somewhat overshadowed in recent times by work in other areas such as
capital adequacy. We feel that we can make a particular contribution here – both
owing to our position in such a major global financial centre and because, in sterling
at least, we are a potential provider of liquidity. So we justify devoting significant
resources to the analysis of liquidity issues, and the development of potential risk
reduction strategies for liquidity problems – nationally and in particular
internationally.
At the other extreme, whilst we feel strongly about the desirability of robust and
widely applied accounting standards – and are prepared to express our views on the
big picture aspects of this from time to time – we do not devote significant resource to
analysis, or lobbying in this area.
c)

Preparation for a Financial Crisis

And finally, tail event territory though it may be, we need to undertake preparation for
financial crises. We need to think forward to being “in-event” where instability has
actually been triggered, whether by a business failure of a firm or firms or by a
terrorist or other disruptive event. We need to prepare now, in advance, to enhance
predictability at what would be a time of great uncertainty. We need to know how we
will work with and communicate with public authorities and with the private sector.
There is a different set of factors which impact our decisions in this area. First, our
“must do” roles are dependent on crisis preparation and an adequate general
understanding of how the financial system operates, with all the complexities entailed.
Second, while each national authority has its specific responsibilities to fulfil, the
speed with which decisions would then need to be made and actions implemented
make it also essential to act effectively as a single operational unit. In the UK the

16
FSA, HMT and the Bank have developed mechanisms designed to turn this into
reality and to provide necessary confidence to the market.
And third through testing programmes, we can obtain feedback as to whether our
efforts are likely to prove successful and to refine preparation as we go along.
The costs to the economy of failure would be high and the expectation is that we
would be well prepared. This puts a strong onus on collecting in advance up to date
information on firms and markets, or being confident of its availability and source.
And also of regular and exacting testing programmes – working with other authorities
and with the private sector.
6.

Conclusion

So in conclusion, the field of financial stability oversight presents us with plenty of
challenges. Not only is the world more complex, but we need to devote real thought
as to how best to operate and organise ourselves so as to contain risks.
Defining the resources you need, and how to deploy them is challenging in itself. My
prediction is that as the system’s complexity increases we will all find ourselves
asking the same questions:
Just what should we do? Why? And what effect will it have?
