Annex
A monetary approach to modelling QE can cross-check estimates of QE’s impact derived
from other frameworks, such as event studies. Forward-looking monetary and portfolio
balance models, which relate asset price developments to future QT asset sales that
change the relative supply of money and other assets, can help analyse the implications
sales to be made in the future, something that event studies – given their focus on the
news in announcements of asset sales – by nature cannot do.
A modified version of a model drawn from the Bank’s model suite (specifically, the sectoral
monetary model of Cloyne et al. (2015)) adopts such a forward-looking approach. The
model is estimated as a set of sectoral blocks, which are linked together using standard
macroeconomic identities and relationships to get an aggregate impact on GDP and
inflation. Each block models the broad money (M4ex) holdings of that sector. One of the
sectors considered covers a group of asset managers known as non-intermediate OFCs
(which we have labelled NBFIs in the main text), including the insurance companies and
pension funds that typically hold a substantial amount of government debt.
The demand for money by this sector is modelled as a portfolio-balance relationship
linking asset managers’ holdings of money to the value of their overall portfolio of assets
and the expected holding period return on money compared to other risky assets such as
equities and bonds.

=

wt

+

θ(R Dt – R Bt )

Where mt is the (log of) money holdings, wt is the (log of) total asset holdings, RD and RB

are the returns on the safe (monetary) and risky (bond) asset and θ is the (semi-)elasticity
of substitution between money and bonds (which we can think of as a proxy for the state of
market functioning).
Total asset holdings are just the sum of money and the value of risky assets such as
bonds and equities:

W = M + PB B

The holding period return on the risky asset depends on the coupon or dividend payment
and the expected capital gain to be made over the period:
R Bt

=

EPBt+1 − PBt

where C is the coupon on the bond or dividend on the equity.

Given an expected schedule of asset purchases or sales from this sector, this then
delivers a relationship for risky asset prices which is a discounted function of future NBFI
money holdings, with the discount factor dependent on the substitutability between money
and other risky assets.
p� bt =

m
�t
θEp� bt+1
+
sb + θ(1 + c) sb + θ(1 + c)

where sb is the initial steady-state portfolio share of risky assets and c the initial coupon
rate or dividend yield. It is useful to consider the case where sb and (1 + c) are close to 1,
this approximates to:
p� Bt ≈

m
�t
θEp� Bt+1

1 + θ (1 + θ)

where lower case letters refer to logged values and a ^ refers to log-deviations from the
initial steady state. Solving this recursively forward gives

As can be seen if asset prices are expected to increase N periods in the future, and
assuming the money supply does not change up to that point, then today’s asset prices
will only rise by a fraction of that amount given by �
as N gets larger.

The approximate solution to asset prices here is analogous to the solution of goods prices
in the model of money demand and inflation first introduced by Cagan (1956) and applied
in a rational expectations setting by Sargent and Wallace (1973). In that model, the price
level is a discounted function of current and expected future money supplies. The only
difference here is that we are applying it to asset prices rather than goods prices and to
the demand for money by asset managers (NBFIs) rather than the aggregate demand for
money. 1 Note, in the exact solution to the NBFI model, the impact of a QT sale on asset
prices also depends on the substitutability between money and risky assets, whereas
goods prices are exactly proportional to an immediate permanent increase in the money
supply under Cagan’s transactions demand for money. So the analogy is not perfect. Once
asset prices are determined in the NBFI sectoral block, they then affect other sectors and,
in turn, output and inflation through the various channels discussed in Cloyne et al. (2015).

In Cagan’s model of aggregate money demand, real balances depend negatively on the expected rate of
goods inflation.
