Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to have this opportunity to address this
38th International Pensions Conference, which is being hosted here in Windsor by British
Airways (BA).

Pension funds play a key role in generating long-term savings to fund

investment and economic growth. During my time working for BA, I gained a valuable
insight into the challenging world of pension fund management and investment through the
four years I spent as a fund trustee and investment committee chairman.

Successful pension fund investment and management requires a long-term perspective,
reflecting the nature of pension liabilities. But any view of the longer-term needs to be
continually reviewed and updated in the light of changing evidence about the economic
fundamentals which drive longer-term trends. Whether it is for the short term or the longer
term, forecasting the future is inevitably a hazardous business! Pension funds and other longterm investors need to be continually aware of the possibility that the assumptions on which
they have based their projections and investment strategies need to be reviewed and updated.

This morning I want to talk about one of the areas where we have recently seen a significant
shift in economic performance – the global inflation climate. In the 1990s and the early
2000s it was customary to assume that the influence of China and other low-cost economies
would exert a sustained disinflationary impact on the prices of manufactures and other
internationally-traded goods. However, since the middle years of this decade, we have seen a
much stronger inflationary impetus from goods which are traded on global markets,
particularly oil and commodity prices.

This upward pressure has been particularly noticeable over the last year – with the oil price
now trading at over $140, about double its level a year ago. Over the same period, food
commodity prices have risen by over 50%.1 Alongside this, we have also seen a broader
change affecting the rate of inflation in traded goods more generally, including manufactured
goods – as Chart 1 shows.

The sustained and prolonged impact of this shift in the global inflation climate is now
showing up in higher rates of consumer price inflation in most countries around the globe.
Some countries – especially in Europe – managed to weather the first round of energy and
commodity price inflation – from 2004 to 2006 – quite well, partly because of the cushioning
impact of an appreciating currency. But the latest surge in oil and food prices is now resulting
in a widely-based rise in inflation affecting most countries in the global economy, as Chart 2
shows. This rise in consumer price inflation is particularly noticeable in Asia but in the UK
and some other European countries, inflation has recently reached levels not seen since the
early 1990s.2

UK CPI inflation reached 3.3% in May 2008, its highest level since July 1992. German CPI inflation hit 3.3%
in June and French CPI inflation reached the same level in May 2008. These were also both the highest levels
reached in these economies since 1991 or 1992. US CPI inflation peaked in September 2005 at 4.7%, the
highest level since May 1991, though it has been close to that level again recently – 4.3% in January 2008 and
4.2% in May 2008.

So what is going on? And does this mark the start of a new inflationary phase in the global
economy? In the first half of the 1970s, a surge in commodity prices and a sharp rise in the
price of oil ushered in a prolonged period of high inflation across the global economy. Is that
what we should now expect? Or will the lessons from that era prevent a repeat performance?

These are the issues which I want to discuss this morning – and they are clearly highly
relevant to me in my current role as a monetary policymaker as well as to you in the world of
pension fund management and investment. I will address three questions in turn. First, what
are the origins of this change in inflationary trend across the global economy? Second, will it
continue and be sustained?

And third, how should monetary policy respond to global

inflationary pressures? I will leave if for you to work out how pension fund managers and
investors should respond in the light of my analysis!

Recent global inflationary pressures

The most striking feature of the recent change in the global inflation climate has been the
upward pressure on oil, food and other commodity prices. Chart 3 shows that compared to
2000 levels, oil prices have increased by five-fold and food and other commodity prices have
doubled. The rise in the oil price we have seen since 2003 is on a par with 1974, though then
the change in oil prices was more abrupt, allowing much less time to adapt to its implications.

Oil and many other commodities are traded on global exchanges, where there is a lot of
investment activity. One suggestion has been that this surge in oil and commodity prices is
the product of speculative activity on these exchanges, driven by financial flows which have
been diverted away from other assets affected by the turmoil on financial markets since last
summer. But while it is true that investor activity in the commodity markets has increased –
including pension funds becoming more involved in this form of investment – speculation
does not appear to have been the primary driver of recent price movements. Detailed studies
by the IMF, BIS and others have suggested that financial flows follow commodity price
movements rather than driving them.3 In addition, there is no obvious link between the
tradeability of commodities and their price movements. As Chart 4 shows, the prices of
metals which are not traded on global exchanges have moved little differently from the more
widely traded metals. Similarly, if we look at the recent wave of food price inflation, it has
affected commodities with well-established futures markets as well as commodities which are
not so readily traded.

See Domanski and Heath (2008) and IMF (2006). HM Treasury (2008) also contains an analysis of recent
commodity price movements which points to supply and demand as the main forces at work, rather than
speculation.

We cannot rule out the possibility that speculation may have exaggerated price movements in
particular markets. But it appears more likely that the fundamental reason for the recent burst
of oil and commodity price inflation is the strength of global demand for these commodities
relative to supply. The fact that the upward pressure across a range of commodities is
reasonably broad-based suggests that negative supply shocks affecting specific markets are
not the main culprit – though supply conditions have clearly influenced the extent of price
rises in specific markets.

The performance of the global economy over the period since 2003 bears out this picture of
strong demand, particularly driven by growth in developing economies and emerging
markets. Over the past five years, the global economy has experienced its strongest and most
sustained period of growth since the late 1960s and early 1970s. And, as Chart 5 shows, the
latest IMF projections suggest that the present decade will see developing economy and
emerging market growth at about double the rate of the preceding two decades. We need to
go back to the 1960s – or possibly even further – to find a stronger decade of growth outside
the mature economies of the Western world.

This is not simply a China phenomenon, or even just down to the Asian economies. Growth
in the Asian economies in the 2000s has been slightly stronger than in previous decades. But
developing and emerging market growth is also now much more broadly-based than in
previous decades. As Chart 6 shows, growth in the 2000s has outpaced the 1980s and 1990s
in all regions. The market transition of Russia and the former Soviet economies has played an
important part in the pick-up in growth from the 1990s, as well as improved economic
performance in Africa – partly reflecting strong demand for commodities.

There are three particular reasons why this strong and broadly-based demand from developing
economies and emerging markets has had such a significant impact on global energy and
other commodity prices. First of all, investment has been a strong driver of demand growth in
these economies – with Asia and other developing regions accounting for over half of all the
increase in global capital spending since 2000.4

The production of capital goods and new

building work requires large amounts of materials and energy – with steel and cement
production being particularly energy-intensive industries.

Second, consumers in richer

countries tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on services whereas rising
consumption in developing and emerging economies is more likely to be spent on physical
products – including food. Third, in the period between the mid-1980s and early-2000s,
energy and other commodity prices were generally low and falling in real terms – as Chart 7
shows. This was not a climate in which producers were inclined to invest strongly in new
capacity or to develop alternatives to traditional sources of energy and raw materials. As a
result, supply has not been able to respond quickly to rising demand – particularly in the oil
industry.

Between 2000 and 2007, IMF estimates suggest that nominal investment grew on average by 8½% for the
world as a whole; within that average growth was 5¾% in the advanced countries, 16¼% in the emerging and
developing countries as a whole, and 18% in developing Asia. The emerging countries accounted for 51½% of
the total investment growth over that period.

9
In the oil market, we can observe directly the contribution of strong demand outside the
OECD economies to recent price pressures. In recent years, incremental oil demand in OECD
economies has been declining, as economic growth has slowed in a number of economies and
higher prices have affected consumption. But incremental demand outside the OECD has
continued to grow strongly relative to available supply – as Chart 8 shows. The positive
impact on oil demand from strong economic growth has offset any dampening effect of higher
prices, and subsidies have also been used to reduce the extent of price increases in many
countries.

Outlook for global inflation

As I mentioned in my introduction, this wave of oil and commodity price inflation has raised
the spectre of the 1970s, when a similar surge in the price of energy and other globally-traded
commodities was followed by a prolonged period of high inflation in many countries. In the
current situation, we can identify other parallels with this earlier episode. Then, as now, the
global inflationary surge followed a prolonged period of low global inflation accompanied by
falling real energy and commodity prices. And in the early 1970s, as now, strong growth in
developing economies played an important role in adding to global demand and pushing up
prices on global markets.

In discussing the outlook it is important to distinguish two different aspects of a rise in global
inflation. The first is the extent to which economies across the globe will continue to face

10
upward pressure on inflation from rising oil, commodity and the prices of other imported
traded goods. The second is the possibility that high rates of inflation become embedded in a
wide range of economies – through rising wages, high rates of growth of money spending and
elevated price expectations. It was this second aspect of global inflation which proved so
damaging in the 1970s.

As I have already argued, the origins of the current upward pressure on oil and commodity
prices lies in the strength of demand across the global economy, and in particular the
contribution to demand from resource-hungry developing countries and emerging markets. If
global demand continues to grow strongly relative to supply, we should expect continuing
high and rising energy and commodity prices, with upward pressure on the prices of traded
goods and services in the global economy more generally. That is simply a restatement at the
global level that inflation is the product of two much demand chasing supply – “too much
money chasing too few goods.”

An easing in the upward pressure on oil and commodity prices therefore appears unlikely
unless the world economy slows significantly. There is already a slowdown underway in
most advanced economies, in response to the “credit crunch” and the squeeze on disposable
income from higher imported energy and raw material prices. Consensus forecasts point to
growth of below 2% in the US, the UK, the euro area and Japan in both 2008 and 2009. But
for oil and commodity price pressures, the performance of Asia and other emerging market
economies will be crucial and here Consensus forecasts currently only point to a very modest
slowdown. As a result, across the world economy as a whole, the IMF is still projecting
global growth to be above its historical trend over recent decades in 2008 and 2009, followed
by a pick-up in growth in 2010 (Chart 9).

Note: 2008 to 2010 are IMF forecasts.

These projections could turn out to be too optimistic if forecasters are underestimating the
negative impact that high inflation and rising energy and commodity prices will eventually
have on developing and emerging market economies. So far, many of these countries have
sought to cushion the impact of rising global price rises on their consumers and producers
through subsidies. But these subsidies are now being withdrawn in a number of economies –
and as their impact on government finances accumulates, the pressure to do this will
increase.5 At the same time, emerging market economies experiencing high inflation – which
includes India and China – are seeking to slow the growth of their economies to ease
inflationary pressures.

In response to these developments, we should expect demand for energy, food and materials
to slow eventually – both in response to higher prices and weaker growth. But there is great
uncertainty about the timing of such a change in trend. And even if we might reasonably
expect some degree of stabilisation in oil and commodity prices over the next couple of years,
it is very difficult to predict the price level at which this might take place. It is therefore quite
possible that we will see further upward pressure on inflation from global commodity markets
in the short term, before we see some stabilisation or reversal of recent price trends.

The more important question, however, for global inflation over the medium term is whether
what starts out as a temporary rise in inflation becomes more deeply embedded through its

increases have been seen recently in China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, India and Pakistan.

12
impact on inflation expectations and the rate of growth of money spending in the major
economies of the world. That is what happened in the 1970s and early 1980s in most major
economies, as Chart 10 shows. In the UK, inflation peaked at over 25% in 1975 and ran at
double digit levels for most of the time until 1983. Inflation peaked at around 15% in the
United States and France. The most notable exception to this pattern was West Germany –
which managed to contain the inflationary shock much more effectively than other advanced
economies.

Monetary policy and global inflation

This highlights a very important point in relation to inflation trends over the medium to longer
term. Though global factors can contribute short-term volatility, inflation performance over a
longer period of time should reflect domestic monetary policy.

In that sense, Milton

Friedman was right when he said that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary
phenomenon”.6

Inflation over the medium to longer term depends on the monetary

framework in place and the policies pursued within that framework. It should therefore be
possible to restore price stability over a number of years, even in the face of major price
shocks from the global economy – as the Bundesbank demonstrated in the 1970s.

Friedman (1970)

13
How does monetary policy achieve this? The main instrument of monetary policy in modern
economies with liberalised financial markets is the short-term interest rate. Changes in the
interest rate and beliefs about its future path will affect the whole structure of interest rates
across the economy. Expectations about the future conduct of monetary policy are also
important in shaping the behaviour of firms and households – particularly in relation to setting
wages and prices. As Chart 11 shows, there are three main mechanisms through which
interest rates and expectations about future policy can help to anchor inflation in the medium
term, even when there is a short-term volatility injected through price movements on global
markets.7

Pricing climate

The first mechanism is through the exchange rate. A rising exchange rate can help dampen
the impact of a surge in global inflation. For the UK and continental Europe, the appreciation
of the pound and the euro against the dollar since the early 2000s has helped to some extent to
dampen or offset the first-round effects of global inflation on import prices. In dollar terms,
world manufacturing export prices rose by over 8% per annum between 2002 and 2007. But
in euros, they barely rose at all, helping to shield the euro area against some of the imported
inflation affecting the US and other countries which link their currency to the US dollar. The
UK experienced a similar appreciation against the dollar as the euro until last year. However,
since then, the depreciation of the pound against the euro has afforded us less short-term
protection against more recent inflationary shocks and import price inflation has picked up
considerably.

However, while exchange rate movements can be a helpful factor, they cannot shield
economies totally from global inflationary shocks – particularly the sort of price movements

the global economy on UK inflation.

14
we have seen recently – a doubling in the global oil price and a significant increase in the
prices of globally-traded food commodities. As we have seen around the world, measures of
inflation will inevitably be affected in the short term by significant price shocks of this sort.
Then the challenge for monetary policy is to ensure that both the rate of growth of demand
and output and the path of inflation expectations remain consistent with price stability over
the medium term, so that once the shock has passed through the system low and stable
inflation returns.

Of course, this is easier to state in principle than to achieve in practice. There is a risk that
medium-term price expectations are pushed up by a period of higher inflation. And difficult
judgements need to be made in the extent to which demand should be dampened to offset an
external cost shock – or whether it is sufficient to simply to prevent second-round effects.
That judgement depends, in part, on the scale of the shock itself.

However, in two respects, the major developed economies are much better placed to deal with
the current round of oil and commodity price shocks than they were in the 1970s. First of all,
domestic inflationary pressures were already building up in many economies in the early
1970s before the impact of rising oil and commodity prices was felt. This was reflected in
high and accelerating money GDP growth in these economies, as Chart 12 shows.8

Money GDP growth is a good summary statistic of domestic inflationary pressure, as it represents the growth
of money income and is an indicator of the pressure which money spending is placing on domestic supply.

15
In the UK and France, money GDP was increasing at around 15% per annum even before the
oil price shock hit in 1974. This reflected increases in wages and money spending which
were clearly already incompatible with low inflation. By contrast, money GDP growth was
slowing in West Germany over this period, suggesting that domestic inflationary pressures in
that economy were under much better control.

Chart 13 contrasts this experience with comparable data from the mid-2000s. In the US and
the same major European economies, rates of growth of money GDP growth in recent years
have been broadly flat and mostly in a range of around 2-6%. Wage growth and other
indicators of domestic inflationary pressure have been generally subdued across the major
developed economies. This has been less true of emerging market economies, however,
where there has been much more evidence of domestic inflationary pressure building up in
response to strong economic growth.

The second contrast with the 1970s for the major developed economies is that the frameworks
for setting monetary policy are now much better established and anchored on the goal of price
stability. In the UK, the framework established in 1997 which gave operational independence
for the Bank of England has worked successfully for over a decade, building the credibility of
our institutional arrangements and reinforcing confidence in a world of low and stable
inflation. The European Central Bank is approaching its tenth anniversary and in the US the
Federal Reserve has operated as an independent central bank with a mandate for price
stability over many decades.

16

This contrasts with the situation in the early 1970s when the Bretton Woods system – which
had helped to underpin low inflation in many countries in the 1950s and 1960s – broke down
in 1971. Only in West Germany, where the Bundesbank played a key role in the policy
response – was a coherent and robust system of domestic monetary control established to
contain inflation. Many other economies – including the UK – struggled to develop an
effective policy response to the oil price shocks and domestic inflationary pressures, with the
result that high inflation persisted for a decade – or even longer in some countries.

Conclusions and policy challenges

These contrasts should give us some encouragement that the UK and other developed
economies are better placed than they were in the 1970s to weather the current surge in oil
and commodity prices. But there are still some very significant challenges. The operation of
monetary policy is clearly much more difficult and complex against the current background of
global inflationary pressures. And the measures required to restore price stability over the
medium term are likely to result in a much less smooth path for the real economy than we
have become used to in a more benign global inflation climate.

In the UK, our monetary framework is anchored on an inflation target of 2% for CPI
inflation.9 Significant deviations of inflation from that target have been rare since the present
framework was established in 1997. Before last month, only one explanatory letter from the
Governor of the Bank of England had been triggered by a movement of inflation more than
one percentage point away from the target.

Rising oil and food prices have already caused the biggest deviation from target and in last
month’s letter, the Governor made clear that the MPC expects inflation to go higher as we
move through this year.

However, his letter also emphasised that the Committee is

determined to ensure that this is a temporary rise. The MPC is still aiming to return inflation
to target within the normal forecast horizon of two years.

How will the Committee achieve that? In the absence of a significant appreciation in the
exchange rate, which seems unlikely at present, our main channels of influence are through
the growth of demand and inflation expectations. First, we need to judge how big is the risk
9

Before 2004, the target was 2.5% for RPIX inflation

17
that the rise in inflation becomes more deeply embedded through its impact on inflation
expectations and on wage and price setting behaviour. And second, we need to judge the path
of demand most likely to keep inflation expectations low, or bring them back onto track if
they are pushed up temporarily. The Bank’s May Inflation Report made no secret of the fact
that we expect a significant slowdown in demand and output growth over the course of this
year and into 2009 to be part of the process through which inflation is brought back to target.
And we are now just embarking on the forecast round for the August Inflation Report which
will update that assessment.

The task of setting monetary policy is complicated further by the impact of the “credit
crunch” which is raising the cost of borrowing and restricting its availability across the
economy independently of interest rate changes. So our judgements on monetary policy
clearly need to take into account how much of a slowdown is in the pipeline already from
these financial market and banking developments. And the MPC’s actions will also need to
reflect the emerging evidence on inflation expectations – including the possibility that shortterm inflation pressures could become embedded in the next round of pay settlements. So far,
regular pay growth (ie excluding bonuses) has been remarkably stable in the UK at around
4%. But recent evidence has showed a sharp upward move in public expectations of inflation,
particularly for the shorter term, as Chart 14 shows. This creates bigger upside risks for
medium-term inflation, and increases the possibility that a more pronounced or prolonged
slowdown in the real economy will eventually be needed to bring inflation back to target.

In contrast to the UK and other major developed economies, the emerging markets and the
developing world appear less well placed to weather the current wave of oil and commodity
price shocks. As I highlighted earlier, they have less well developed monetary frameworks
and are more exposed to domestic inflationary pressures as a result of rapid growth. Their
economies are more resource-hungry and therefore they are potentially more exposed to a
shock from high oil and commodity prices.

We should not therefore be surprised if there is a significant deterioration in macroeconomic
performance in a number of these economies as they seek to come to terms with inflationary
pressures and much higher oil and commodity prices. We are already seeing much higher
inflation in many emerging market economies. And it may be that the optimistic consensus
around the growth prospects for Asia and other emerging markets is punctured to some degree
by the drag on their economic growth from higher energy and raw material prices over the
next few years.

In my title today – I posed the question “How big is the threat” from current global
inflationary pressures? In the face of the current oil and commodity price pressures, we
cannot expect to sustain the benign world of steady growth and consistently low inflation that
has characterised the last decade and a half across many developed economies, including the
UK. Inflation is being pushed up in the short term, and it will take time to get it back under
control. That will require a squeeze on spending and incomes in the UK and other economies,
with consequences for economic growth and employment in the short term.

But the real challenge is to maintain the conditions of price stability which will support
growth and employment over the long term. And in that respect the message is much more
positive. With the right policies, we can avoid the mistakes of the 1970s, when high inflation
became deeply ingrained and embedded in behaviour and expectations. But it will be the
actions of national monetary authorities – in the case of the UK, the Monetary Policy
Committee – which will determine whether that is the case. While global cost pressures can
influence the short-term path of inflation, over the longer term Friedman is right: “Inflation is
always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”.
