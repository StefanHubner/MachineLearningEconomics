Annex: Model specification

This model is based on a variant of a model developed by Harrison, Seneca and Waldron. It consists
of 5 basic equations.
IS curve:
Phillips curve:

𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡 = 𝐴𝐴𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝐵𝐵𝔼𝔼𝑡𝑡 𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝐶𝐶(𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 − 𝔼𝔼𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗ )

𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 = 𝐷𝐷𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝐹𝐹𝔼𝔼𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝐺𝐺[𝐻𝐻(𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡 + 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡∗ ) + 𝐽𝐽(𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1

Potential output 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡∗ :
Natural rate 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗ :

𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡∗ = 𝐿𝐿𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 + 𝑀𝑀𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1

∗
∗
+ 𝑄𝑄𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡∗ + 𝑆𝑆𝔼𝔼𝑡𝑡 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡+1
− 𝜈𝜈𝑡𝑡
𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗ = 𝑁𝑁𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1

where all capital letters denote functions of underlying parameters, 𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡 is the output gap, and the risk
premium 𝜈𝜈𝑡𝑡 , the cost-push disturbance 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 and productivity 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 follow exogenous autoregressive

processes.

The model is closed by either a level rule

or a difference rule

𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜑𝜑𝜋𝜋 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 𝜑𝜑𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡

∆𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝜑𝜑𝜋𝜋 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 𝜑𝜑∆𝑦𝑦 (𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡−1 )
