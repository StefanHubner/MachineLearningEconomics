SPEECH TO MERRILL LYNCH CONFERENCE: THURSDAY 26 APRIL 2007
“A PERSPECTIVE ON RECENT MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENTS”

Global monetary and financial stability

The past year or so has been marked by resilience in both the global economy and the international
financial system. World growth has been robust. On average, headline inflation across the
industrialised world has remained contained. Capital markets have, so far, weathered the gradual
withdrawal of monetary accommodation in much of the G7, and also a series of specific
disturbances, without destabilising spillovers. In short, the world has enjoyed a further period of
monetary and financial stability. Against that background, banks and dealers have posted fairly
remarkable profits, accumulating more capital resources; and the (risk-unadjusted) returns of the
fund sector – and so probably for most of you here today – have been healthy.

There are, for sure, wrinkles in this picture, including here in the UK. But overall it is probably
not what most commentators would have expected given that oil prices have more than doubled
over recent years. For financial markets, it has surely been important that such a large cost shock
has not led to a pronounced rise in global inflation, dislodging medium-term inflation expectations,
and so prompting industrialised country monetary authorities to slam on the brakes. With the build
up of household debt in many countries, and releveraging of parts of the corporate sector, that
would not have been a happy prospect.

That, taking the industrialised world as a whole, monetary credibility has been sustained without
aggressive policy action may owe something to the reasons for the increases in energy and other
commodity prices – namely, the rise of China, India and other Asian economies which, as well as
boosting global demand, has also been putting downward pressure on internationally traded goods
prices. But, as the Bank has argued before, the way these relative price changes play out in terms
of headline consumer price inflation depends on the overall path of aggregate nominal demand.
And that in turn owes something to the behaviour of central banks.

The textbook response to a cost shock is supposedly to allow the price level to rise, with the
associated temporary pick up in inflation being just that – temporary. In the jargon of central
banking, the ‘first round effects should be accommodated’ in order to contain output volatility; but

3
any second-round effects on inflation, through wage bargaining and medium-term inflation
expectations, should of course be prevented.

What of practice? Well, notwithstanding the rise in inflation in the UK over the past eighteen
months, it is moot whether any of the major central banks did in fact fully accommodate the firstround effects of the oil price rise. That the full impact of the rise in costs has not passed through to
inflation owes something, I believe, to wariness amongst central bankers of their being able, given
uncertainty about the underlying shocks, to calibrate policy with sufficient precision to bring about
such a neat but vitally important distinction between first-round and second-round effects; let
alone of their being able to communicate such a strategy to the public, the business community and
financial markets. Textbook orthodoxy might perhaps have been more compelling if the rise in
energy prices had been both sharp and caused purely by interruptions to, or constraints on, the
supply of energy. But when, as over the past couple of years, the rise in costs was partly the
consequence of increased global demand, and the price rise drawn out, the wariness in fully
accommodating the first round effects was, I think, tangible, and reasonable.

UK monetary policy

That has been the backdrop to my own approach to monetary policy over the past year or so. The
policy stance has needed to be set and explained in the context of cost shocks and demand
conditions, placing a premium on clarity of communication about monetary strategy.1 I have
judged that to be a delicate exercise given recent and prospective volatility in headline inflation.
This thinking informed my vote against an increase in Bank Rate in January. CPI inflation had
risen quite sharply, but was – and, I should say, still is – also expected to fall back quite sharply
towards the 2% target. Provided that broadly ‘humped’ path for inflation materialised over the
coming months, the upside risk to medium-term inflation expectations seemed likely to subside. It
was not a matter of my wanting to avoid surprising the markets in some narrow sense, which in the
greater scheme of things is neither here nor there. Rather, I was concerned that an immediate
move might, on balance, cause unnecessary confusion about the Committee’s view of the mediumterm outlook for inflation and about monetary strategy. In the event, subsequent speeches by
colleagues, and the medium-term perspective of the February Inflation Report, helped to keep that
genie in the bottle.

4
In February, I was strongly in favour of widening the width of the Inflation Report ‘fan chart’ for
inflation during the coming year, to underline the near-term uncertainty about, and the great
difficulty in forecasting, the path of utility prices. It was vital to convey the medium-term
prospect, and also that we stand ready to act if the risks warranted it.

More recently, with Bank Rate at 5.25% and a modestly upward sloping money market curve, I
have characterised monetary conditions as ‘edging towards restrictive’, so long as inflation does as
expected fall back in the near term. That has been appropriate given the degree of pricing power
apparently emergent in conditions of relatively high capacity utilisation amongst firms. It has
provided the platform needed going forward to restrain inflation pressures, and to maintain
anchored inflation expectations, at a time when, understandably, there is public debate about the
outlook given that CPI inflation rose above 3% for the first time, triggering an open letter from the
Governor, on behalf of the Committee, to the Chancellor.

Looking ahead, my votes, and my approach to communicating our monetary strategy, will depend
on balancing the medium-term prospect for demand pressures alongside uncertainties about supply
conditions and near-term inflation expectations caused by volatility in energy costs. This will
entail making judgments about a whole range of influences, including whether or not residual slack
in the labour market might in time, given robust business investment, help to ease capacity
constraints; whether or not competitive conditions amongst retailers will dampen the feed through
of accelerating producer prices into consumer prices; and, most crucially of all, whether wage
bargainers and price setters recognise the absolute determination of the Committee to maintain
price stability.

Risks to the global capital markets

If anchored inflation expectations have so far been maintained, here and elsewhere, two other risks
in, and for, the global financial environment continue to preoccupy commentators: current account
imbalances; and compressed risk premia, together with an apparently high risk appetite, in credit
markets.

There are, I would suggest, some interesting contrasts between these two risks, which – following
the Bank’s Financial Stability Report – I shall call ‘global imbalances’ and ‘low risk premia’.
They can be contrasted in two dimensions: the probability that there is some kind of

5
‘disequilibrium’ that needs to correct; and the probability that any such correction, or adjustment,
will produce destabilising spillovers in the financial system.

On the first – the probability of adjustment – it is widely agreed by economists that one symptom of
global imbalances, the US current account deficit, is unsustainable. It cannot continue indefinitely
at the same rate because eventually the US’s external debt-servicing burden would become too
great. That there will be adjustment, somehow or other, is therefore viewed by most commentators
as near certain. By contrast, while the low risk premia across credit markets are hard to explain, no
one can say for certain that they are unsustainable. A number of changes in the environment point
towards some sustainable reduction in risk premia: more credible monetary regimes; more flexible
labour and product markets, helping economies to adjust to nasty shocks; improved instruments
and markets for managing risk; better diversified portfolios. Whether or not that merits the degree
of risk premia compression seen over recent years is open to question. For some while now, I have
encountered few people in the market who regard credit risk as fairly priced. A distinction is
typically drawn – including in the Bank’s Financial Stability Reports2 – between a ‘fast fuse’ risk,
in which credit is abruptly repriced; and a ‘slow fuse’ risk, in which cheap credit leads over time to
overleveraged borrowers and so to vulnerability to a deterioration in the global economy. As time
passes, attention has perhaps been shifting to the longer-fuse risk, given signs of a pick up in
aggregate corporate sector leverage and gradual dilution of covenants in loan terms and conditions,
most obviously recently in so-called ‘covenant-lite’ transactions in the leveraged loan market.3
But, in contrast to global imbalances, no one can say with complete conviction that a lower risk
premia environment is definitely unsustainable, which may contribute to explaining why few
market participants seem prepared to bet on the time or scale of any correction.

In terms of the second dimension – the probability that any adjustment would be disorderly –
market practitioners at least seem to regard ‘low risk premia’ more seriously than ‘global
imbalances’. Resolution of the problem of global imbalances could come in various ways, not all
of which need involve an abrupt correction in asset prices or further movements in nominal
exchange rates. For example, the US might obtain greater competitiveness through a depreciation
in the dollar’s real value if inflation in China and elsewhere were to be relatively high for a period.
But, for my purposes today, the key point is that any correction in asset prices would most
obviously be concentrated, at least initially, in the foreign exchange markets and, if associated with
a reduced appetite for dollar-denominated assets, plausibly in US Treasury yields too – perhaps
amplified by various option-like structures.4 But these are, of course, the deepest, most liquid

6
markets in the world. So while sharp changes would no doubt inflict losses through parts of
financial system, many practitioners seem to regard the market dynamics as manageable. Indeed,
when in the Bank’s Market Intelligence rounds we explore this issue, the mechanism that elicits
most concern is that any consequent macroeconomic slowdown – brought about in the US by
higher risk-free bond yields or in the euro area by exchange rate appreciation – might put pressure
on the corporate and household sectors after a period in which credit risk may have been
underpriced and so abundantly available. In other words, discussion of ‘global imbalances’ shades
into an exploration of the potential consequences of ‘low risk premia’. But more important, the
fundamental changes in the structure of credit markets over the past half decade or so have left
many practitioners uncertain about the dynamics of any adjustment. Views vary of course, with
some seeing the system as clearly more resilient than half a decade ago, but on the whole
practitioners seem to be more uncertain about the potential for nasty spillovers from adjustment in
‘low risk premia’ than in ‘global imbalances’.

Vehicular finance

This uncertainty stems from changes not just in instruments and markets, but also in institutions –
ie in the nature and structure of financial intermediaries. This is the age of what I call Vehicular
Finance. The key intermediaries are no longer just banks, securities dealers, insurance companies,
mutual funds and pension funds. They include hedge funds of course, but also Collateralised Debt
Obligations, specialist Monoline Financial Guarantors, Credit Derivative Product Companies,
Structured Investment Vehicles, Commercial Paper conduits, Leverage Buyout Funds – and on and
on.5 These vehicles can fit together like Russian dolls. By way of illustration – and, I fear,
slipping for a moment into alphabet soup – SIVs may hold monoline-wrapped AAA-tranches of
CDOs, which may hold tranches of other CDOs, which hold LBO debt of all types as well as
asset-backed securities bundling together household loans. (The diagram may, or may not, help!)

What is going on here? One possible explanation is that capital might be being allocated to
wherever its cost is cheapest for a particular desired risk profile. That optimisation involves
comparing the capital charges applied by regulators to regulated institutions; and by rating
agencies to various types of vehicle (SIVs, CPDCs, CDOs, monolines etc). The ‘smart money’
seems to be assembling its own portfolio of vehicles, so that it can choose from a menu of where to
book transactions. One of the drivers is commonly referred to by practitioners as ‘ratings
arbitrage’. Another was of course Basel I, which triggered the securitisation of high-quality

7
credits, and for quite a few years fuelled a ballooning of vehicles whose existence depended on
commercial banks providing zero-capital-weighted ‘liquidity’ lines. Basel II will change all of
that. Indeed, if central banks are to understand how the global financial system fits together, we
will need to fathom the reconfiguration that Basel II prompts, including the potential for risk
transfers between banks adopting different steps on the ladder of Standard, Foundation, Advanced
approaches that it makes available. For the same underlying reasons, in pursuing their mission,
central banks now need to follow developments beyond the big banks, and I am very grateful to the
hedge funds, CDO managers and others who contribute to the Bank’s market intelligence effort.

Does any of this matter?

(a)

The dispersion of risk, and central banking instruments

The dialogue is, of course, largely qualitative. Given the variety of vehicles and their use of risk
transfer instruments, it has become a commonplace that ‘we’ no longer know where risk lies. Most
often, the ‘we’ is the official sector, and in particular bank regulators. But ‘we’ might just as well
be the management of banks and dealers.

Some commentators plainly see this as a Bad Thing. Is it? At least as put, I am not so sure.

In the first place, the transfer of risk has been a consequence of the development of wholesale
markets, with reasonably broad participation, in all types of credit risk. Provided liquidity is
sustained, that should aid the system’s adjustment to shocks. It also means that, while regulators,
central banks and other analysts have certainly lost some quantity data, our assessment of credit
conditions is enriched by the availability of a wealth of new price signals.

Secondly, while credit risk transfer markets are new, derivative markets in interest rates, exchange
rates and equity prices have existed – on-exchange and over-the-counter – for approaching two
decades. We have not known where those risks are for quite a long time.

Thirdly, if we ‘no longer know where the risk is’, that implies that it has been dispersed beyond the
regulated sector. One might think that was a Good Thing. To take an extreme scenario, if risks
were widely and evenly distributed across savings institutions internationally, a very nasty shock
causing a sharp fall in asset markets would not obviously destabilise the financial system. It would

8
obviously have macroeconomic consequences, by depleting household wealth and raising the cost
of capital for firms. Other things being equal, central banks could respond by adopting an easier
path for interest rates than otherwise, in order to maintain aggregate demand broadly in line with
aggregate supply, with the objective of keeping inflation in line with explicit or implicit targets.
Although the original shock may be nasty, the response would be the routine use of the routine
instrument: the price of central bank money. There is no question of a so-called Greenspan (or any
other kind of) ‘put’ here; the focus would be not asset prices, but the outlook for spending in the
economy and so inflation.

This is obviously rather different from a similarly nasty shock producing severe disorder in a
banking system that was carrying unduly concentrated exposures of some kind. For a central
banker, banks matter because their liabilities are used as money, they are at the centre of the
payments system, and they carry an associated asset/liability maturity mismatch.6 Banking system
distress is therefore typically characterised by a liquidity run. Faced with that, a central bank’s
instrument – used, where necessary, in collaboration with its regulatory and finance ministry
partners – is to supply the system with an increased quantity of its money, without necessarily
changing its price. Given the need to take collateral to protect against risk, and to charge a
premium to create the right incentives, establishing a routine framework for such operations
without creating moral hazard remains ‘work in progress’ for the international central banking
community.7

So it would seem that there is a good deal to welcome in the greater dispersion of risk made
possible by modern instruments, markets and institutions.

But there are most certainly qualifications to such an apparently alluring conclusion.

(b)

The banking system’s residual risk, stress testing and transparency

The banking system retains risk in a number of ways, both pre- and post-risk transfer, and its
aggregate balance sheet has in fact expanded considerably.8 Pre-risk transfer, banks and dealers
hold, or finance, warehouses of portfolios of loans to households and corporates on their way to
securitisation,9 meaning that the banking system can still find itself ‘holding the parcel’ when the
music stops. Post-risk transfer, some risk is contingently retained by virtue of banks and dealers

9
financing the acquisition of risk by hedge funds and others. This entails counterparty credit risk
and, taking account of collateral, is akin to writing out-of-the-money put options.

So, for me, the question is not so much ‘where is the risk?’, as ‘in what circumstances could risk
flow back to the banking system?’; and ‘do banks have enough capital and liquidity to absorb such
flows without stress?’

This is relevant not only to credit risk, but also to transfers of complex market risks. In providing
bespoke ‘solutions’ to their corporate and investment management clients, investment banks
accumulate complex market risk exposures that are hedged largely in public, and so relatively
‘vanilla’ wholesale markets. These hedges are inevitably imperfect. Some of the residual market
risk is now occasionally transferred to the fund sector, via for example variance swaps or
correlation swaps, transforming market risk into counterparty credit risk – underlining the
importance of the work of the industry’s Counterparty Risk Management Group in debating and
promulgating prudent practices.10

Other imperfectly hedged risks are retained, leaving intermediaries with so-called 'basis risk’ – or,
more prosaically, the risk that assumed correlations break down. Put bluntly, if instruments A and
B have subtly (or not so subtly) different characteristics but are nicely correlated for a while, B
might be employed as a ‘hedge’ for A, without the implicit risk exposure turning up in Value At
Risk measures. When a shock hits and the correlation breaks down, the hedge breaks down too,
with a double whammy to VaR and so, for regulated firms, to regulatory capital requirements:
through higher volatility, and a higher measured exposure. To be clear, this is not the fancy of the
ivory tower. As discussed in the Bank’s latest Financial Stability Report, it was one of the factors
contributing to the recent volatility in the market for US sub-prime mortgage securitisations.
Indeed, this hazard may conceivably have increased during a period when markets have not been
especially volatile.

If investment banking entails warehousing optionality and complex forms of basis risk, it puts a
premium on stress testing. Speaking as a policy maker, I would want so-called macro stress tests
to be complemented by more fine-grained stress tests in which management explore the exposure
to complex risks given their qualitative understanding of their business, and taking into account the
possibility of impaired market liquidity. In other words, risk managers need to do ‘market
intelligence’ within their own firms. My sense is that that view is shared by at least some Chief

10
Risk Officers. Greater transparency of such stress testing would not only shed light on the risks
retained by the banking system, it might also have a productive effect on incentives – rather as
greater transparency has enhanced monetary policy making.

What happens when the music stops: ex ante preparation for stress

But of course severe stress cannot be ruled out. Central banks and practitioners therefore expend
effort thinking about what will happen if and when the music stops.

As the Bank’s latest Financial Stability Report discusses, the official sector has stepped up its
practice exercises of various kinds. The private sector analogue to crisis resolution is the
‘workout’, in which a company is restructured under the shadow of insolvency. In a world
characterised by bank intermediation, workouts typically involved bank syndicates co-ordinated by
a few lead banks. Even country workouts in the early 1980s had that broad shape, albeit with the
IMF holding the ring. One might wonder how on earth it would work today, in a world of traded
debt, synthetic risk transfer, and vehicular finance. Much thinking remains to be done on this, but
a policymaker has to form a preliminary view, just in case the music stops tomorrow. My
provisional view is that some investors in credit risk would find themselves without the skill set to
participate in a workout. In a ‘covenant-lite’ world, they might also find themselves with fewer
protections as conditions deteriorated than they would like ex post. Unless markets seized up,
however, they might be able to crystallise their losses by selling out to funds and bank desks who
trade in ‘distressed credit’; and they in turn might be able to sell on to funds and banks with
specialist workout skills and risk appetites. By such transfers, the end-game co-ordination
problems might be reduced. On the way, some hard bargains would be struck, and some
participants would no doubt be surprised by their losses.

But this relatively benign scenario is not guaranteed. It depends on markets continuing to function;
on the infrastructure holding up through volume surges and stress; on the shadow of the insolvency
regimes in various jurisdictions establishing productive incentives; and on lack of uncertainty in
the terms and conditions of market contracts.

That last point needs underlining. In today’s markets, there is a large premium on ex ante clarity
and certainty, as opposed to ex post negotiation amongst bankers who know and trust each other.
The work required is detailed and largely out of the limelight. But getting clarity around things

11
like ‘close out netting’ may make all the difference when the music stops.11 The official
community therefore needs to maintain its encouragement and support for private sector initiatives
to standardise and improve documentation. To take just a few examples from what could be a long
list, this includes the work of New York’s Global Documentation Steering Group; of various
market trade associations; and of London’s Securities Lending and Repo Committee, which helps
co-ordinate the work of different parts of the collateral-financing markets.12

Summary

I have travelled from macro to micro. To maintain the two elements of monetary stability – price
stability, and financial stability – we need credible and effective institutions.

At the macro end of the spectrum, that above all means credible monetary regimes. The MPC is
now ten years old. During that period, inflation expectations have been well anchored to our
target. And no one should be in any doubt that the Committee is determined to keep it that way.

But a credible monetary regime does not insulate the economy, or financial markets, against all
shocks. Over the coming decade, some currently observable imbalances will plausibly work their
way through the system, as the pattern of global saving shifts, asset prices adjust, and we
encounter, eventually, a period of corporate defaults. In ten years time, we may therefore know
whether ‘global imbalances’ and ‘low risk premia’ were resolved with or without stress; and we
may be better informed on whether the changes in the structure of our financial markets help or
hinder the preservation of stability. A benign outcome would be more likely if the industry were to
maintain its efforts on improving ex ante measures to handle stress. Managers of hedge funds and
other modern investment vehicles, as well as banks, have a clear stake in that work.

Close-out netting is a process by which, following a default, open transactions between two
parties are terminated, each transaction is valued and, together with any outstanding
payments, these are reduced to a single net amount owed by one of the parties to the other.
Obtaining legal certainty over recognition of netting across different products and, in
particular, with different legal entities with a common group is very important.
12 The Global Documentation Steering Group (GDSC) is an industry group formed in 1999 to
implement the documentation-related recommendations of the report of Counterparty Risk
Management Policy Group (CRMPG). The primary objective of the Committee is to
encourage the harmonisation of documentation in standard over-the-counter contracts in
order to minimise disparities that can exacerbate market, credit and legal risk. It took the
lead in updating the recommendations on documentation issues for the second CRMPG
report released in 2005. GDSC is sponsored by, but independent of, the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. The hedge fund community is represented on the GDSG. The Stock
Lending and Repo Committee, facilitated and chaired by the Bank of England, provides a
forum for practitioners and the authorities to discuss structural (including legal)
developments in London-based securities lending and repo markets.

ANNEX: VEHICLES
CDO: Collateralised debt obligation. Typically, a structured finance product where a SPV
issues notes backed by, or referenced to, a portfolio of underlying assets. The notes issued
are tranched by seniority into senior, mezzanine and equity. The underlying assets could be
corporate bonds, loans or structured finance securities (such as mortgage-backed securities or
notes issued by other CDOs), and they might be owned either directly or synthetically via
credit default swaps.
CDO squared: A CDO invested in CDO tranches, typically mezzanine tranches of synthetic
CDOs.
CDPC: Credit Derivative Product Companies. A highly-rated limited purpose company,
with permanent capital, that sells credit protection on individual names or synthetic CDO
tranches. CDPCs differ from monolines in that they write protection only via credit default
swaps. They are in some respects akin to synthetic banks.
Closed-end fund: An investment company that issues shares to investors and invests the
proceeds in a pool of assets typically stocks and/or bonds. Recently some funds have
invested in ‘alternative’ assets such as hedge funds, private equity and infrastructure, and
structured credit. Shares in closed-end funds are traded like other equities. The funds may
issue their own debt to obtain leverage. They may also issue different classes of shares with
different entitlements to income or capital receipts from the underlying investments.
CP (Commercial paper) conduit: A SPV that issues CP backed by financial assets
originated by one or more sellers. They are generally supported by liquidity facilities
provided by their sponsor or a third-party bank.
DPC: Derivative product company. A bankruptcy-remote structure that houses credit risk
from long-dated derivative transactions. They are typically wholly-owned subsidiaries of
financial services companies. In general, DPCs sit between their sponsor and an external
counterparty in derivative transactions and protect the counterparty from the potential default
of the derivative seller (the sponsor).
Monoline insurance companies: Monoline insurance companies provide protection against
a specific type of risk (typically credit risk). Originally developed in the 1970s to provide
US municipal bond holders with credit guarantees (or ‘wraps), over the past few decades
they have diversified into the ABS and CDO markets (particularly the highly-rated senior
tranches).
SIV: Structured Investment Vehicle. A SPV that funds a diversified portfolio of highly
rated assets by issuing short-term commercial paper, medium-term notes etc. In general,
there is a maturity mismatch between their assets and liabilities. They aim to generate a
positive spread between their return on assets and funding costs.
SPV: Special purpose vehicle. A bankruptcy-remote company created for the sole purpose
of acquiring assets or derivative exposures and issuing liabilities linked to these assets. Also
known as a special purpose entity.
