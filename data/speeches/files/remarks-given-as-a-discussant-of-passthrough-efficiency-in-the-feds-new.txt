Introduction
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this paper, which brings together many of the themes of this timely
and important conference. Interest in the pass-through of central banks’ policy rates has enjoyed something
of a resurgence in recent times, as the Federal Reserve begins to tighten policy in the presence of a vast
amount of reserves created by quantitative easing, and as other central banks loosen further by moving their
policy rates to new record lows.
Of course the Bank of England is in the latter camp. This month the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) – of
which I am a member – voted to introduce a package of measures to support the necessary adjustments of
the UK economy as it responds to the decision to leave the European Union. This package included a
reduction in Bank Rate to a new low of 0.25%, and the launch of a Term Funding Scheme to reinforce the
pass-through of this cut, alongside a £60bn increase in our stock of UK government bonds and the purchase
of up to £10bn of investment grade non-financial corporate bonds.

As central bankers and money market enthusiasts know, the issue of pass-through is of utmost importance.
The paper begins with the premise that a necessary condition for competitive money markets is that any
change in the Fed’s policy rate is passed through, one for one, to all market transaction rates. In truth, one
can make the much broader statement that the very efficacy of monetary policy and its usefulness as a tool
for influencing the economy is premised on the pass-through of changes in policy rates to money market
rates. And that’s why some of us have endless appetite to discuss any wedge between them.
With that in mind, I’d like to pick up on two of the central themes of Darell and Arvind’s paper.


The first is the impact of regulation – in particular the leverage ratio - on money market function. I will
restate the case for having a leverage ratio, but will also argue that it can be much improved by the
exclusion of central bank reserves from the exposure measure.



The second is the role of central banks in money markets. Building on the paper’s analysis of the
Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP), I will make the case that central banks are now more proactive
in: the influencing of market rates; the provision of liquidity insurance, and the design of market
infrastructure.

Finally, I’d like to say a few words about pass-through beyond the money markets. As interest rates decline
toward zero, it becomes more difficult for banks to pass through changes in policy rates to those rates faced
by households and businesses – hampering the transmission of monetary policy. The Term Funding Scheme
is designed to mitigate this impact, and hence re-inforce pass-through to the real economy. So I’ll end by
briefly outlining how that works.

The impact of regulation on money market function
Let me start with the impact of regulation on money market function. Darell and Arvind’s analysis of the
dispersion of money market rates offers evidence of the impact of regulation on behaviour and pricing. Their
index of money market rate dispersion has risen since the introduction of the Supplementary Leverage Ratio,
and has a tendency to increase around key regulatory reporting dates (Chart 1).

It is difficult to dispute the idea that regulation has had an impact on how markets function globally. The
decline in repo market activity has actually been larger in the UK than in the US and is around 20% below its
2013 level (Chart 2). And the price of repo in sterling markets has increased approximately in line with its US
counterpart, as measured by the increase in GC repo rates relative to 3-month OIS swaps that carry similar
economic risks (Chart 3). Alongside this there has been a deterioration in perceptions of overall sterling
secured market function over the past year or so, which participants note has coincided with pressure to
reduce balance sheet size due to regulatory reporting requirements – in particular the leverage ratio
(Chart 4).

Some of this impact may be transitory: as dealers and others adjust to the new arrangements they may find
ways to transact more efficiently while staying within the letter and spirit of the regulation. As the paper
describes, opportunities for netting could be further increased were a greater proportion of repo transactions
to be centrally cleared – around 10% of US Dollar repo transactions are currently cleared centrally,
1

compared with 45% in Sterling, and 65% in Euro. Dealers may improve the optimisation of their balance
sheets across the whole group, better allocating leverage headroom in one part of the business to more
leverage-constrained activity in other parts of the group. And over time new approaches to intermediation
could emerge – some exchanges are exploring platforms to allow end users of the repo market (such as
pension funds) to transact directly with one another.

However, such innovations and adjustments will only ever provide a partial offset to the underlying changes.
And Darell and Arvind are right to say that regulation bears a social cost by increasing segmentation and
reducing incentives to compete, search and match in money markets. But it would not be right to then
conclude that the framework of regulation that was introduced following the crisis represented a net cost to
society. Would it really be desirable to return to a world in which, as Pozsar (2016) put it, the quantities
traded were “endless”, and the impact on balance sheet “an afterthought”?

The role of the leverage ratio

Given that I am a member of the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which has been one of the architects of
the post crisis regulatory framework in the UK and put a leverage ratio in place in 2015, you probably won’t

be surprised to hear that I support the existence of the leverage ratio. Remember that over the period from
2000 to 2007 around a quarter of dealers held less than enough equity to absorb losses worth 2% of their
assets. That was facilitated by an over-reliance on risk weighting, which tended to place too much weight on
periods of stability and too little on periods of underperfomance. It’s now clear that in the years before the
crisis banks were underpricing the use of their balance sheet, and that the dispersion of rates in money
markets probably underestimated the true real marginal cost of intermediation.

This view has been formalised in numerous studies that have found the leverage ratio was a better predictor
2

of bank failure during the crisis than the risk-weighted capital ratio (Chart 5) . And recent studies (such as
Fender and Lewrick (2015) and Grill, Hannes and Smith (2015)) suggest that a calibration of 3-5%
maximises the benefits to society in the form of greater financial system resilience relative to the impact of
higher bank funding costs.

However, despite my belief in the utility of the leverage ratio, I also recognise that no regulation is perfect.
And that if we policymakers spot opportunities to minimise regulation’s adverse impact on the liquidity of core
financial markets without compromising the positive effect on resilience, we should take them.

Reducing unintended consequences
The FPC actively seeks out these improvements - a process we refer to as “snagging” in reference to the
process by which a newly constructed building is checked for protruding nails and screws which could snag
and tear one’s clothing. (If only all architects were so diligent.)
As a result of one such snagging exercise – our annual statutory review of the leverage ratio Direction – this
month we made the decision to exclude central bank reserves from the exposure measure of the leverage
ratio framework. This change was a good example of close co-ordination between macroprudential and
monetary policy – without it a loosening of monetary policy through the creation of reserves by the MPC to
purchase assets would have led to a deterioration in banks’ leverage ratios at precisely the time we would
like them to support credit growth in the economy.
In making this decision we were comfortable that it wouldn’t dilute the financial stability benefits of the
leverage ratio because, as you know, central bank reserves are a unique asset class. So long as they are
matched by liabilities in the same currency (which we have stipulated as a condition of their exclusion), they
pose neither credit nor liquidity risk. And banks’ holdings of them represent a buffer against unexpected
events.

It is true that this change will mechanically reduce the nominal amount of capital required to meet the
leverage ratio standard, other things equal. That is not the FPC’s intention, and so we intend to re-calibrate
the standard to offset this impact as part of our planned 2017 review of the leverage ratio framework.

To be clear, removing central bank reserves from the leverage exposure measure will not neutralise all of the
impact of the leverage ratio that Darell and Arvind highlight - for example repo will be unaffected by this
change. However it should address some of the other issues around money market rate dispersion and
pass-through efficiency raised in the paper.


If central bank reserves are included in the leverage exposure measure, banks must think carefully
before accepting a deposit. If it implies an increase in their overall asset size, their leverage capital
requirement will increase commensurately, and that will bring a shadow regulatory cost of the same
order of magnitude as those calculated in the paper. This disincentivises competition for deposits,
and drives a wedge between the central bank policy rate and rates that banks will pay on wholesale
deposits.



If central bank reserves are removed from the exposure measure it instantly gives banks somewhere
to place cash without impacting their leverage ratio. They would therefore maximise profits by
competing for deposits at rates all the way up to the rate that can be earned on reserves at the
central bank, thus improving pass-through to average bank deposit rates and strengthening the
transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. And the early indication from market
participants is that they do indeed expect this change to strengthen the link between money market
rates and Bank Rate.

In short, although regulatory innovations such as the leverage ratio are here to stay, we can and should
attenuate some of their impact on money market function where it is possible to do so without reducing the
financial stability benefits. This process of reducing unintended consequences is made easier by close
co-ordination of different policymakers, which at the Bank of England is facilitated by having monetary,
macro- and micro-prudential policy all under one roof.

The role of central banks in money markets

Let me turn to the role of central banks as a participant in money markets. Just as private market participants
have grappled with new challenges in the post-crisis world, so too have central banks. And we have
responded in three ways.

First, we have become more flexible in the way we implement changes in the policy rate. The frameworks we
use to influence market rates need to recognise the fact that there are a lot more reserves in the system than
before, and that regulation has reduced the incentive to arbitrage small differences in money market rates.

As the paper sets out, the Fed’s RRP is a good example of adapting to this new reality. The facility improves
pass-through efficiency by offering a risk-free asset to a broad range of counterparties that extends beyond
banks, thus strengthening the floor on money market rates more generally. The counterpart to this facility in
the UK is our ability to issue Bank of England bills, though thus far we haven’t had the need to do so: since
we began paying Bank Rate on all reserves in 2009 the wedge between overnight unsecured money market
rates and Bank rate has averaged 4bps, and the standard deviation also been 4bps (Chart 6). Another
example of changing the way we operate was our decision in 2014 to grant broker dealers access to reserve
accounts at the Bank of England for the first time.

Second, empowered by strengthened regulatory frameworks and resolution regimes, we have reaffirmed our
th

commitment to abide by Bagehot’s 19 century advice that the best way to avoid a panic is to “lend freely
and vigorously...on all good banking securities.” For example, shortly after the result of the UK’s referendum
on EU membership was declared we made clear that banks already had collateral positioned with us such
that they could borrow more than £250bn, and announced that our regular liquidity auctions would continue
to run on a weekly basis throughout the summer. Coupled with banks’ own strong internal liquidity positions,
this has helped ensure the smooth functioning of money markets. And overnight market rates have stayed
close to Bank Rate throughout the period since the referendum.

Third, we have taken steps to ensure that the vital infrastructure of money markets continues to remain
effective. The work on risk-free benchmark rates being undertaken by both the Federal Reserve and the
3

Bank of England is a good example of this. Building on recommendations made by the FSB – which drew
on the findings of a market practitioners group chaired by Darell - both central banks have convened working
groups of market participants with the aim of identifying benchmarks of nearly risk-free reference rates that
4

could that could sit alongside Libor. And both have taken steps to improve the resilience and coverage of
overnight unsecured benchmark rates – the Bank of England by taking over the administration and reform of
5

SONIA , and the Fed by overseeing the creation of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate. Such benchmarks are
a vital means of assessing the pass-through efficiency of changes in policy rates – meaning Darell and
Arvind will continue to be able to write papers on the topic long into the future.

Pass-through beyond money markets

Let me turn briefly to pass-through beyond money market rates. Deep structural forces affecting savings and
investment preferences have combined with the ongoing legacy of the financial crisis to push the interest
rate required to keep our economies in balance much lower than historical experience.

SONIA is the weighted average of unsecured brokered transactions, and it is the main reference rate in OIS contracts. Current daily
volumes are around £7-10bn, down from around £25bn before the financial crisis. In July 2015 the Bank announced its plans to reform
SONIA, including by broadening its coverage to encompass overnight unsecured transactions negotiated bilaterally aswell as those
arranged via brokers. For more information see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/benchmarks/soniareform.aspx.

The resulting proximity of policy rates to what was once known as the zero lower bound has important
implications for the pass-through of monetary policy. Specifically, once household and business deposit rates
have reached a very low level, it becomes difficult for banks to reduce them further. Recent international
experience seems to bear this out – Chart 7 shows that pass-through to retail deposit rates tends to be
weaker when risk-free rates are very low. As a result, in order to protect their margins banks may not reduce
the rate they charge on lending, thus dampening the transmission of monetary policy.

The MPC was acutely aware of this when it decided at the beginning of this month to reduce Bank Rate to
0.25%. In order to reinforce the transmission of this change we also launched a Term Funding Scheme
(TFS) through which central bank reserves will be lent to banks and building societies for four years. Should
they maintain their lending to the real economy, the rate they will pay over this period will be Bank Rate. For
each 1% that net lending by an institution falls, the cost of TFS funding will rise by 5bps to a maximum of
25bps. By tethering banks’ term funding costs more closely to our official policy rate, this should create the
capacity for them to pass the reduction in that rate through to households and businesses, thus
strengthening the transmission to the real economy.
Since the MPC’s decision we have published further documentation, technical detail and guidelines for firms
considering using this facility. We are now open to applications, and the scheme will be available to be drawn
upon from the middle of September.

Conclusion
Let me summarise. Darell and Arvind’s paper draws attention to some very important issues, namely the
decrease in competitive forces and increase in frictions in money markets, which work to reduce the
pass-through efficiency of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy setting. And the behaviour of the index of
dispersion of money market rates that they have created provides evidence that these developments are at
least in part due to post-crisis changes in the regulatory framework.

Taking into account the improved resilience of the financial system, these regulatory changes are net
beneficial to society, so they are not going to be rolled back. However, policymakers can and should be
willing to attenuate some of their unintended consequences, and be open to challenge on their design.

As participants in money markets, central banks should be open to new ways to enhance pass-through
efficiency by showing flexibility in their implementation of monetary policy. The Fed’s RRP does this by
making a risk-free asset available to a wider range of counterparties than would ordinarily be the case. And
the Bank of England’s recently launched TFS will help the pass-through of very low levels of Bank Rate to
the rates faced by households and businesses in the real economy. Central banks can also contribute to the

function of money markets more broadly, by being willing to act early to address potential liquidity needs, and
to support money market infrastructure more generally.
I’ll end with a word on central banks’ “footprint.” Many of the developments raised in the paper and that will
be discussed over the course of this conference have been a response to the needs of the day: having more
reserves in the system is a reflection of the monetary policy stance required by economic developments; the
leverage ratio has been developed as a part of the response to failure of the pre-crisis capital framework;
and our intervention in risk-free benchmark rates is intended to avoid a co-ordination failure in which the
most appropriate and robust benchmarks would not be adopted by the market.
So while it is true to say that central banks’ footprint in money markets is larger now than in the days prior to
the crisis, this has been out of necessity rather than design. As a tribe, central bankers retain a strong belief
in financial markets’ ability to facilitate price discovery, allocate capital efficiently, and provide useful signals
about the macro economy and financial stability.
