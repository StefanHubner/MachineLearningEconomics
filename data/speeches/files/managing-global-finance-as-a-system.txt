It is a great honour to be giving this year’s Maxwell Fry Global Finance Lecture. Max was a tremendous
colleague, both during his time here at Birmingham University and as Director of the Centre for Central Banking
Studies at the Bank of England.

Max also had a rare gift. Through his exceptionally rich academic and public policy career, he was able to
integrate the insights from disciplines which all too rarely communicated – monetary theory and central bank
practice, advanced and emerging market experience, financial markets dynamics and mainstream
macro-economics.

The global financial crisis could not have provided a clearer demonstration of the benefits of combining these
insights. Without them, it would have been impossible to make sense of the chaotic dynamics of global
economies and financial systems at the time. In other words, nothing could have provided a better case study of
the importance of Max’s work than the crisis.

And it is lessons from the global financial crisis with which I want to begin. These are of course many and varied.
But among the most important is also perhaps the simplest: to safeguard against systemic risk, the financial
system needs to be managed as a system (Haldane (2009)). As put, this statement seems rather obvious,
perhaps even tautological.

Yet, pre-crisis, it was far from obvious. The orthodoxy then was that safeguarding individual financial firms was a
necessary and sufficient condition for system-wide stability. This was the financial stability equivalent of the
English aphorism: “look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves”. And so it appeared during
the long pre-crisis period of stable growth and stable banks - the “Great Moderation” (Bernanke (2004)).

The crisis has rewritten that orthodoxy. It revealed that the safety of individual banks was neither a necessary nor
sufficient condition for systemic stability. Not necessary because, in any well-functioning system, individual banks
can and should fail. Not sufficient because, in an integrated web, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
In focussing on individual banks, policymakers had been, to coin another English aphorism, “penny-wise but
pound-foolish”. That is why Great Moderation gave way to Great Recession (Gai and Kapadia (2010)). That is
why systemic risk entered the public lexicon. And that is why financial regulation has, in the period since, been
fundamentally re-oriented towards the monitoring and management of systemic risk.

Interestingly, that lesson would have come as no surprise to anyone familiar with dynamic, integrated networks
outside of the world of finance. Assessing the stability of almost any network known to man – whether natural,
physical, social or economic – relies upon a system-wide assessment. And protection mechanisms for this
system need to be calibrated to system-wide characteristics (Goldin and Mariathasan (2014)). Financial webs are
no exception. The history of financial crises suggests they may be closer to the rule.

This new orthodoxy has framed the post-crisis regulatory reform agenda. It is why so-called macro-prudential
policy has risen in prominence. It is why the world’s most inter-connected banks will in future be required to run
with extra capital and liquidity. It is why OTC derivatives will in future be centrally traded and cleared. And it is
why resolution of the world’s largest, cross-border banks has become such a priority. For the global banking
system we now have a blueprint, an emerging new set of international rules of the road.

Yet if instead of banks we consider the financial fortunes of countries; if instead of inter-bank exposures we
consider cross-border flows of capital; and if instead of international banking regulation we consider the
international monetary system, it is far from clear that lessons have been learned, much less that the international
rules of that road have been reformed.

Arguably, the rules of the road for this system have failed to keep pace with the growing scale and complexity of
global financial flows. It is for this reason that some have called the international monetary system a
“non-system” or “anti-system” (Truman (2012) and De Larosiere (2014)) - a system whose shape and scale has
outgrown its architecture.

I want to discuss these developments and their public policy implications. I first discuss the historical evolution of
the international monetary network, including the remarkable recent surge in financial globalisation. I then
discuss why financial globalisation can be double-edged from a stability perspective. Finally, I consider steps to
strengthen the international architecture, to better manage global finance as a system.

The historical evolution in global finance

It is fascinating to track how global financial integration has evolved over the past century. One way of gauging
that is by looking at measured stocks of external asset and liabilities - the cumulative consequences of past
cross-border capital flows (and valuation changes). Charts 1 and 2 plot world gross external assets, measured
relative to world GDP, over the past 140 years. As a comparison, world trade relative to world GDP is also
shown.

Global integration of trade and finance has followed roughly similar patterns. Both rose prior to World War I
during the heyday of the classical Gold Standard, when trade and capital liberalisation were last at their peak.
Both then fell during the interwar years, as national protectionism led to trade and financial barriers being erected.
Then, from around 1960 onwards, trade and finance once more began to rise due to the lifting of restrictions on
cross-border trade and capital flows (Broadbent (2014)).

Despite this close historical correlation, the undulations in global finance are far greater than those in world trade.
In 1960, global finance was around one third of its value in 1914, measured relative to world GDP. By 2010, it
had risen to three times its value in 1914. Put differently, in 1980 global trade and global finance were on a

broadly equal footing, at around a quarter of world GDP. By 2010, global finance was nine times global trade. At
the same time world trade has flat-lined, global finance has come of age.

Today, cross-border stocks of capital are almost certainly larger than at any time in human history. We have hit a
new high-water mark. The same is probably true of cross-border flows of goods and services and is most
certainly true of cross-border flows of information (Haldane (2013)). We are accustomed to talking of the
information technology revolution. Yet the revolution in global finance has in some respects been every bit as
striking.

While these trends tell us something about relative patterns of global interconnection, they leave unanswered the
question of whether global finance is a truly integrated network. To gauge that, consider an alternative measure
of global capital market integration – the correlation between national saving and investment rates. From
Feldstein and Horioka (1980), we know that this correlation provides a proxy for capital market integration.

For example, a savings/investment correlation of one indicates a closed capital account: all domestic investment
needs to be fully financed from domestic saving. At a global level, this would signify something close to global
financial autarky. By contrast, a correlation of zero implies that domestic investment can be fully financed on
global capital markets. This would signal something close to perfect capital market integration. So
saving/investment correlations of zero and one define the outer limits of global capital market integration.

Chart 3 plots this correlation coefficient over the same 140-year period shown in Chart 1. Broadly-speaking, the
two series track one another fairly closely. But Chart 3 now allows us to say things about the absolute degree of
capital market integration. And what a roller-coaster ride it has been. During the first period, from around 1880
up until the Great Depression, global financial integration sat roughly mid-way between its outer limits. Integration
was high-ish, but far from perfect.

For around a fifty year period, from the 1930s through to the 1980s, global finance then went into hibernation.
The Feldstein/Horioka coefficient skirted one for large parts of this period. The global financial system operated
as anything but a system. Indeed, it was this which prompted Feldstein and Horioka in the early 1980s to present
the “puzzle” of still-low levels of capital market integration.

Yet at pretty much precisely the point this puzzle was being identified, it began to disappear. Correlations quickly
st

moved from close to unity in the early 1980s to close to zero by the start of the 21 century. This was an
astonishingly rapid evolution from a world close to financial autarky to one close to financial nirvana. In the light
of the crisis, measured levels of global capital market integration have fallen somewhat. But they remain at
higher levels than at any point in history.

th

Overall, then, the picture is clear. For much of the 20 century, global finance was more patchwork than network.
But the past thirty years have seen that picture change spectacularly. Today, global finance is a well-connected
network, a tightly-woven and tangled web, a genuine system.

The double-edged nature of financial integration

So what are the implications of this increase in global financial integration? There have been large numbers of
studies exploring the growth and welfare implications of these trends, using cross-country and time-series
evidence (Rey (2013)). This evidence paints, at best, a mixed picture. While capital integration ought to enhance
international risk-sharing, there is surprisingly little evidence of this having conferred macro-economic benefits –
and some of it having imposed costs.

For some economists, this is a perplexing and contentious conclusion. It is made all the more so by the fact that
the evidence on global trade integration points overwhelmingly towards positive effects (Kose et al (2009) and
Berg and Krueger (2003)). Yet, outside of economics and finance, this conclusion would be far less perplexing
and contentious.

For many other disciplines, it is well-known that the increased integration of a network can be double-edged from
a stability perspective (Watts (2002), Haldane and May (2011)): whether it is physical networks, like utility grids;
or natural networks, like eco-systems; or social networks, like the world wide web. The logic is straightforward.

Within limits, connectivity acts as a shock-absorber. Links in the system act as a mutual insurance device,
helping distribute and disperse risk. These systems are then “robust” to shocks. But when shocks are sufficiently
large, connectivity may instead serve as a shock-transmitter. Risk-sharing becomes risk-spreading. Links in the
system act as a mutual incendiary device, amplifying risk. These systems are then also “fragile”.

So connected systems tend simultaneously to be both stable and unstable, calm and turbulent, robust-yet-fragile
(Acemoglu et al (2013), Gai and Kapadia (2010)). In other words, integration can be double-edged. It generates
a world with instances of more frequent and/or larger dislocations. In short, what is true of natural, physical and
social systems is also true of global economic and financial systems.

To illustrate that, consider Chart 4. This shows the results of a simulation of a hypothetical financial network of
firms. These have differing levels of financial strength, measured on the x-axis. Think of this as a country’s level
of official reserves or a bank’s level of liquid assets. On the z-axis is a measure of network interconnectivity – the
scale of cross-border assets or interbank exposures. Finally, on the y-axis is a measure of systemic risk – the
incidence of default across the network, whether of countries or banks.

As the network becomes better integrated, for a given degree of financial strength, systemic risk remains low. We
operate in a zone of systemic stability. That is because the network is operating as a shock-absorber, a network
insurance device scattering risk to the four corners. So it was pre-crisis.

But for a large-enough shock to financial strength, the system fundamentally changes shape. The network flips to
a zone of systemic instability. That is because it is now operating as a shock-transmitter, a network incendiary
device - and the greater the degree of integration, the sharper this knife-edge. So it was during the crisis.

This is the robust-yet-fragile property of connected webs. The global financial crisis provided no better example.
The flat earth that was the Great Moderation gave way to the fragile planet that was the Great Recession.
Risk-sharing gave way to risk spreading, risk distribution to risk contagion.

This was by no means an isolated incident. Chart 5 plots a measure of global capital market integration (external
assets/GDP) against a measure of the incidence of crises – all crises and banking crises (Reinhart and Rogoff
(2011)). Integration appears to have been associated with an increase in the incidence of crisis over the past
couple of decades, perhaps especially banking crises.

It is not just the incidence, but also the prospective size of crises and their spill-over consequences that has
increased. Chart 6 provides one perspective on that. It looks at the scale of IMF programmes over time,
normalised by the borrowing country’s quota. Two features are striking: first, the increased incidence of
programmes; but second, more dramatically, their increased scale.

Academic evidence has long pointed towards important spillover effects from national or international
disturbances (Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), Forbes and Warnock (2012) and Fratzscher (2012)). But recent
evidence points towards more potent contagion channels. For example, Rey (2013) finds evidence that a
common global risk factor drives asset prices and cross-border capital flows, for both advanced and emerging
economies.

It is worth putting under the microscope these shifting patterns in global financial market correlations, especially
over the most recent period. Charts 7-9 plot correlations between long-term bond yields, equity prices and
investment grade corporate bond spreads respectively in the US, UK and the euro-area over the past few
decades. Two features stand out.

First, there has been a steady rise in the degree of co-movement in asset prices over time. Take government
bond yields over the past 50 years. Over the first quarter century, from 1960 through to the mid-1980s, average
pairwise correlations between bond yields were around 0.1. Over the subsequent quarter-century, these
correlations have risen steadily, averaging 0.7 over the latter part of the sample (Chart 7).

Second, and more striking still, is the level reached by these correlation coefficients towards the end of the
sample. Whether it is safe government assets or risky corporate bonds and equities, correlations typically lie in
the range 0.7 to 0.9. Other things equal, a common global factor potentially accounts for perhaps 70-90% of the
movements in advanced country asset prices.

These correlation patterns are stronger, and even more striking, when we look at their evolution over time. As
one example of that, Charts 10 and 11 plot “heatmaps” of the strength of a common factor in the variation of spot
and forward rates respectively for government bonds at different maturities in the UK, US and Germany over the
period since 1995.

In general, they show the same pattern of high and rising correlations over time. But these correlations also show
distinctive flare-ups, associated with spasms in global financial markets such as the global financial crisis and last
year’s ‘taper tantrum’. By the end of the sample almost the whole of the yield curve, bar the very short end, is
moving synchronously across countries. To a first approximation, global yield curves appear these days to be
dancing to a common tune.

All of this evidence points in one direction: the global monetary system operates in a similar fashion to all other
tightly-knit networks – it is robust yet at the same time fragile. It is driven by potent – increasingly potent –
spillover effects and common global factors. In short, global finance can only be understood and managed as a
system.

Characteristics of the global financial network

The next obvious question is what mechanisms are in place to underpin the resilience of this tightly-woven web?
Let me highlight some key characteristics of the global financial network which are useful in assessing its
robustness. And let’s start with the good news.

One positive trend in the international flow of funds is their changing composition. Table 1 breaks down these
flows of funds into their foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio and debt components, for advanced and
emerging markets, over the periods 1980-1994 and 1995-2012. Two features stand out.

First, the declining share of debt-based finance and second, as the counterpart to this, the rising share of portfolio
and in particular FDI investment. For example, since 1995 the dominant source of emerging market capital has
switched dramatically from debt-based finance towards FDI. Equity and FDI together now account for two-thirds
of emerging market financing.
That is significant from a stability perspective. Empirical evidence strongly suggests that FDI and, to a lesser
1

extent, equity is a far more stable source of external financing than bank debt (Kose et al (2009)). That is in part
1

Bank of England research adds one nuance to this story. Dell’Erba and Reinhardt (2013) find that financial sector FDI appears to behave
more like debt flows than traditional FDI flows.

because of its longer duration and in part because of its superior risk-sharing properties. For at least some
emerging markets, their national balance sheets appear to be moving to a more robust footing.
A second positive development comes from looking at countries’ degree of self-insurance, in particular their stock
of foreign exchange reserves. As Chart 12 shows, these have grown dramatically since the second world war
and especially since the Asian crisis, both in money terms and relative to world GDP. Reserves have risen from
$1.5 trillion in 1995 to over $11 trillion by end-2013, or from around 5% of world GDP to around 15% today.

Third, this has been accompanied by some augmentation of multilateral official sector facilities for helping handle
external financing shocks. For example, since 1980 IMF quota resources have risen from just under $80 billion to
around $370 billion, or from 0.7% to just less than 2% of world GDP (Chart 13). The most significant
augmentation in resources came from the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) in 2009, which were agreed to
increase temporarily the resources available to the IMF at the height of the financial crisis.

Fourth, alongside these multilateral facilities, the past few years have seen rapid growth in regional and bilateral
financing facilities (Chart 14). Regionally, we now have a number of financing arrangements, including the
Chiang Mai initiative in Asia (established in 2000), the European Stability Mechanism (established in 2012), the
Latin American Reserve Fund (established in 1991), the Arab Monetary Fund (established in 1976) and, most
recently, the BRICS development bank (established in 2014)). Regional facilities now total around $1.3 trillion.

In addition, during the course of the crisis, bilateral foreign currency swap lines were agreed between around
14 central banks, in both advanced and emerging market countries. Although these swap lines were temporary,
in October 2013 they were replaced by a set of permanent, and potentially unlimited, swap lines among a group
of advanced economy central banks: the US, Canada, the UK, the euro-area, Switzerland and Japan.

These four developments, in combination, are likely to have increased significantly the potential pool of liquidity
insurance available to the global financial system in dealing with external financing shocks. The question is
whether this degree of insurance has kept pace with the accompanying rising tide of global capital market
integration.
One metric for that is found by scaling countries’ foreign exchange reserves by a measure of financial
globalisation – for example, total external assets (Chart 15). Despite the rapid rise in reserves, its ratio to external
asset stocks has actually fallen since 1980, from 10% to around 8%.

Second, official reserves have risen unevenly across countries: the degree of concentration in reserves has
increased threefold since 2000. Moreover, those countries most at risk from capital flight are not necessarily
those with the highest reserves. Scaling countries’ reserves by measures of their external short-term
indebtedness suggests a highly-uneven pattern (Chart 16), with a number of countries holding less than would be
needed to meet a year’s worth of capital outflows.

Third, this pattern is broadly mirrored when moving from measures of self-insurance, such as reserves, to official
financing measures. Chart 17 scales IMF resources by external assets. Since the 1980s, this measure has
roughly halved from 3% to 1.5%. And fourth, even once we augment multilateral financing with measures of
regional official financing, total official resources relative to external assets are still shy of their levels in 1980.

Taken in combination, this paints a picture of an international monetary system whose underlying topology has
fundamentally changed shape and scale – much larger, much more connected. But it is also a system whose
architecture may have failed to keep pace with those changes. Therein lies a key potential fault-line.

Strengthening the system

This naturally begs the question - what might be done to close this fault-line, to improve the resilience of the
international monetary system? One response would be to retreat from financial globalisation by re-imposing
barriers to capital movement, unravelling the tightly-woven knitting of the global financial web. We have seen this
movie before. It opened in the aftermath of the Great Depression and ended in disaster.

There should be better ways of making financial globalisation work, while guarding against its darkest
consequences – to achieve robustness without fragility. But this may require new tools and approaches,
operating system-wide. It may even require a new architecture, strong enough to withstand the new scale and
scope of systemic risks.

Let me discuss four areas where progress could realistically be made in developing this new architecture:
financial surveillance; debt structures; macro-prudential policies; and multilateral financing. Each would be an
important new brick in the wall.

(a) Improvements to global financial surveillance

Forewarned is forearmed. Understanding the dynamics of the international monetary system, its tipping points
and edges, is a pre-requisite for effective management. Some progress has been made on this front. For
example, the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report has, since 2002, sought to plot the evolving contours of
global finance. And the publication by the IMF of “Spillover Reports”, since 2011, is a further step in the right
direction.
Nonetheless, these steps only take us so far. The centrepiece of the IMF’s surveillance efforts remain the
country-specific Article IV consultations. Whether that country-specific focus, enshrined in the IMF’s 1944
Articles, can be justified in today’s highly integrated global financial network is a more open question. This year’s
IMF Triennial Surveillance Review may be an opportunity to tilt the balance further towards multilateral
surveillance.

What more might be feasible? I have a dream. It is futuristic, but realistic. It involves a Star Trek chair and a
bank of monitors. It would involve tracking the global flow of funds in close to real time (from a Star Trek chair
using a bank of monitors), in much the same way as happens with global weather systems and global internet
traffic (Haldane (2011)). Its centre piece would be a global map of financial flows, charting spill-overs and
correlations.

Such a global financial surveillance system could serve a number of policy ends. It would allow policymakers to
monitor the evolution of the financial system in real time, as it expanded, contracted and changed shape. It would
also allow them to simulate and stress-test this system to help detect impending financial cliff-edges. The IMF
would be the natural guardian of this global-financial-map-cum-stress-testing-machine.

To give this concept some (literal and metaphorical) colour, Chart 18 shows a bank of heatmaps of correlations
across a wide range of assets (safe and risky) and a large set of countries (advanced and emerging). There are
shown at three dates – a pre-crisis period of calm, the Lehmans Brothers crisis of 2008 and at present. These
correlations are grouped in two ways, by asset class and by country.

The correlation matrix broadly matches the patterns from the earlier heatmaps. Temperatures appear to be rising
over time, with flare-ups at times of crisis. With this map now encompassing a wider range of assets and
countries, the strength of these correlations underscores the genuinely global nature of today’s international
financial system.

But there is a second, more striking pattern which emerges when these correlations are grouped by asset class
and by country. Correlations are far higher by asset class than by country. In other words, there is greater
co-movement among similar asset types across countries than among different asset types within countries. A
portfolio-level cut is more revealing about the underlying dynamics of global finance than a country-specific cut.

How to make sense of these patterns? One explanation may lie in the behaviour of global asset managers.
Financial markets are increasingly driven by their behaviour (IMF (2014)). For asset managers, the key
determinants of their portfolio choice may be the risk characteristics of different asset classes, rather than their
country characteristics. Certainly, that is consistent with the correlation patterns.

Either way, these patterns serve to underline the importance of multilateral and spillover-based analysis, as
distinct from country-specific (Article IV) surveillance, when assessing risks to both global and national financial
systems. They also carry potentially important implications for how these dynamics might most effectively be
managed from a macro-prudential perspective (discussed below).

(b) Improvements to country debt structures (and restructures)

Debt flows are known to be a potent source of instability within the international monetary system. The
instabilities they generate are exacerbated by frictions in the design of debt contracts. One such friction is that
debt is an inherently pro-cyclical instrument. For example, a negative shock to a country’s income prospects will
tend to raise debt sustainability concerns and hence borrowing costs, thereby worsening sustainability.

Another friction is that, once internationally-held debt becomes unsustainable, restructuring it is usually a messy
process because of the lack of an internationally-agreed legal framework. In part for that reason, countries have
tended to delay tackling unsustainable debt. But if debt is truly unsustainable, delay tends to further worsen debt
dynamics, ultimately increasing costs for both debtors and creditors (Krugman (1988)).

These contractual frictions can make debt a fickle friend. They will tend to aggravate debt sustainability and
debtor prevarication problems, thereby encouraging investors to withdraw credit at the first sign of
trouble – so-called “sudden stops” (Calvo (1998)). These frictions are well-illustrated by historical sovereign debt
restructuring experience, most recently in emerging market economies such as Argentina.

Yet it is widely accepted that there are straightforward contractual solutions to these debt problems. One is to
issue debt instruments whose contractual features reduce pro-cyclicality, such as GDP-linked bonds. Their
repayment profile adjusts with a country’s ability to pay, thereby acting counter-cyclically and quasi-automatically
to defuse repayment risk (Shiller (1993 and 2003), Barr et al (2014)).

The impact of such instruments on debt dynamics could be significant. A recent Bank of England study
considered the debt-to-income ratios of the G7 countries, given shocks to growth and real interest rates,
comparing conventional and GDP-linked debt. The latter cut the variability of G7 debt-to-income ratios in half.
Yet despite their attraction, no more than a handful of countries internationally have so far issued GDP-linked
debt instruments.
Contingent convertible (“CoCo”) bonds are a second, potentially useful, debt instrument. These have been
popular recently among banks. For countries, they could be designed with a duration which is automatically
extended if a country breaches certain pre-set stress conditions – for example, if it is the subject of an IMF
lending programme (Brooke et al (2012)). This would then deliver some automatic alleviation of short-term
liquidity pressures. So far, no country has issued such instruments.

There has been somewhat greater progress towards the inclusion of contractual clauses which assist in the
restructuring of sovereign debts once these become unsustainable. In particular, following the Asian crisis there
was a push by the international community to include Collective Action Clauses (CACs) in international bond
contracts.

11

Yet as recent Argentine experience illustrates, this has not closed the book on sovereign debt restructuring
problems. Existing CACs tend only to cover one particular class of bonds. This gives rise to a potential
aggregation problem if other classes of bond vote against – or hold-out from – a restructuring agreement.
“Aggregation” CACs include the option for bonds to be restructured on the basis of a single vote across all
affected bonds. A recent IMF paper proposed that these clauses be included in foreign law bonds, a proposal
which appears to have the support of the international community (IMF (2014)). Kazakhstan recently
incorporated these clauses into its bond programme.

The international community may in future need to provide stronger incentives to countries to improve debt
structures, be it through GDP-linked bonds, CoCos or CACs. Linking the availability or terms of IMF financing
more explicitly to debt structures might be one way of doing so.

(c) Enhanced macro-prudential and capital flow management policies

Significant progress has been made over the past decade in the design and implementation of macro-prudential
regimes and capital flow management policies. The shift in the prevailing orthodoxy, analytically and
operationally, has been remarkable.

A decade ago, policies to manage actively inflows and outflows of capital were frowned upon by the IMF and the
international community. Yet today these measures have been largely accepted as part of the toolkit for
protecting countries from boom and bust cycles in capital flows (IMF (2012)). Perhaps most significantly of all,
more than 40 countries have already deployed these measures since 2009.

A great many analytical and operational issues remain open. What are appropriate states of the world for
introducing and releasing capital flow management measures – a first or last resort? Which policy measures are
likely to be most effective – outflow versus inflow, price versus quantity controls? And how do these policies
operate alongside other arms of policy – monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential?

At present, we have neither the theory nor the experience to answer these questions definitively. But case law is
rapidly emerging, including on their potentially adverse cross-border spillover consequences (Forbes et al (2013)
and Magud et al (2011)). Looking to the future, it is realistic to think that better-defined, internationally-agreed
“rules of the road” could emerge for capital flow management policies in the period ahead.

Macro-prudential policies have also come significantly into fashion over recent years, with many countries
implementing them and a number having distinct, if still fledgling, macro-prudential frameworks (Nier et al (2011)).
Case law is being built rapidly and empirical evidence is emerging on the efficacy of different macro-prudential
tools (Lim et al (2011) and Kuttner and Shim (2013)).

The new Basel III banking rules have added international momentum to this policy trend. They introduce, at an
international level, an explicitly macro-prudential capital requirement – the Counter-cyclical Capital Buffer (CCB).
This adjusts regulatory capital rules over the credit cycle, to help build resilience and smooth booms and busts.
The CCB rules also hard-wire in a degree of cross-country co-ordination – a “reciprocity provision”. In particular,
there is a presumption that any adjustment in the CCB buffer by one country is reciprocated by countries whose
banks are lending into that country. In that way, the potentially sterilising impact of cross-border capital flows on
domestic macro-prudential measures is reduced.

This reciprocity provision makes sense in a world of highly correlated cross-border banking flows. Chart 19 plots
cross-border bank claims across a selection of countries over time. It suggests a high degree of cyclicality in
cross-border credit. Table 2 suggests, furthermore, that these flows have become increasingly correlated over
the past decade.

But it is not just cross-border claims which are cyclical and correlated across countries. Chart 20 plots the cycle
in total credit across countries, while Table 3 looks at the degree of cross-country correlation in total credit
provision. They suggest total credit also follows a global cycle which has strengthened over time. On this
evidence, the credit cycle is as much international as domestic.

If credit cycles are global in nature, there may in future be a case for national macro-prudential policies leaning
explicitly against these global factors. This would help curb the global credit cycle at source. It would take
international macro-prudential policy co-ordination to the next level. While not without operational problems, this
is much more likely to be a practical policy option than co-ordinating national monetary policies.

A second macro-prudential policy avenue for the future concerns the non-bank sector. For example, the pattern
of correlations in Chart 18 is consistent with asset managers playing an increasingly important role in driving
financial markets. Yet macro-prudential policies have, to date, focussed on banking sector-specific measures
operating at a national level.

The next phase of macro-prudential policy may see its focus shift in two important ways: towards measures
targeted at the non-bank, as well as banking, sector and towards measures targeted at particular markets, as well
as particular countries. In this second phase, some macro-prudential decision-making would naturally reside at
the international, rather than national, level.

(d) Improved international liquidity assistance

This is plainly the thorniest of the issues. Fifteen years ago, then-IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer
set out the case for the IMF becoming a quasi-international lender of last resort (Fischer (1999)). His argument

was that the IMF’s financial firepower had failed to keep pace with the scale of cross-border capital flows. At the
time, I remember being sceptical about the feasibility and desirability of this proposal.

In the period since, there has been a further dramatic ratchet up in cross-border capital flows. This has not been
matched by IMF resources. The mismatch between global financial risk and global financial resources has
widened. Fifteen years, and several crises on, I think it is clear that Stan was right.
th

Ratification by the US of the 14 general review of IMF quotas would help close the gap but, by itself, would not
prevent it from yawning. Various proposals for augmenting IMF resources have been put forward (Lachman
(2006) and Farhi et al (2011)), but have foundered on political rocks. Partly in response, regional facilities have
sprung up as a partial substitute, growing broadly to match in scale multilateral facilities.
But the financial system is a global, not regional, one – indeed, increasingly so. Regional facilities can be a
complement, but are no substitute, for multilateral insurance mechanisms. Put differently, the global public good
of financial stability risks being under-provided if it is reliant on regional solutions. Indeed, access to some of
these regional facilities is itself conditional on an IMF programme.

Conclusion

The international monetary and financial system has undergone a mini-revolution in the space of a generation as
a result of financial globalisation. It has become a genuine system. This has altered fundamentally the risk-return
opportunity set facing international policymakers: larger-than-ever opportunities, but also greater-than-ever
threats.
Dealing with these risks calls for turning the current “non-system” into one with an identifiable architecture.
Measures to improve the monitoring and management of private capital flows and to augment and strengthen
official sector financing facilities are important milestones towards this long-term objective.

Correlation coefficient colour scale

Sources: Bloomberg and Bank calculations.
(a) Correlation matrices are based on correlation matrices developed by HSBC FX Quantitative Strategy Team. Data refer to correlation of
weekly returns measured over a backward-looking one-year period. Quotation conventions for prices and yields have been normalised onto a
price-based quotation convention so that a positive correlation denotes equity prices going up and bond prices going up for example (hence
yields and spreads dropping). The VIX has been normalised like a yield, so that VIX going down with equity prices rising produces positive
correlation.
