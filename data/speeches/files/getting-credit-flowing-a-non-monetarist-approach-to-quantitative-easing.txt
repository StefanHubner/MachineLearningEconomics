GETTING CREDIT FLOWING:
A NON- MONETARIST APPROACH TO QUANTITATIVE EASING
Adam S. Posen1

It is a rare occasion to have well over a hundred people, including many younger people with
presumably more exciting things to do, show up on a Monday evening for a speech about
monetary policy. Or rather, it would be rare, were it not for the well-known commitment of City
University’s students to economics, and for the challenging economic situation that we find
ourselves in today. Despite being gratified by tonight’s turnout, I can hope that at least the latter
reason for popular attention to macroeconomic policy will abate before long.

The worst threats from the crisis of 2008-09 are behind us, and there are even indications that the
recession – now a severe but normal one – is coming to an end. The aggressive and
unconventional monetary policy measures undertaken by the Bank of England (along with those
by the UK government and by other major central banks and governments) played the critical
role in ruling out the worst outcomes which might have come out of the financial panic of 200809. The negative impact on the real economy from the financial panic was obviously of historic
and awful proportions, but limiting the impact and precluding an even greater worsening of
conditions was a success of policy. As a number of my MPC colleagues have argued in recent
weeks, the Bank’s Quantitative Easing [QE] policies contributed both to this prevention of a
deflationary spiral and the subsequent improvement in credit conditions, asset markets, and
inflation expectations.2 To this I would add that QE eased the successful implementation of
fiscal policy stimulus, which was also constructive.

I am grateful to Neil Meads for excellent research assistance and suggestions, and to Roger Vicquery for assistance
with section 2. The views expressed here are solely my own, and not those of the MPC, any of its members, of the
Bank, or of PIIE.

See Bean (2009), Dale (2009), and Miles (2009). In particular, they present evidence on how the spread between
interest rates on Gilts and OIS has come down in the UK, unlike in other countries, which have not engaged in the
size and nature of QE undertaken by the Bank. That lower spread indicates normalization of credit conditions.

2

Yet, how QE actually worked, what its long-term implications will be, particularly for inflation
over the longer-term, and what the experience of QE has taught us about the UK economy
remain controversial or at least obscure. What I would like to do tonight is to give you a
somewhat different interpretation of the unconventional monetary policy measures undertaken
by the Bank than perhaps has been heard before, putting it into a comparative context globally
and historically. In so doing, I hope to shift the focus away from some concerns that are
unfounded, like the idle chatter one sometimes hears about printing money causing inflationary
periods, and towards some concerns I have that are quite real. In particular, I am concerned that
the UK financial system as currently structured, as well as damaged by the crisis, may not be
ready to support the coming handover of recovery to private-sector impetus from public-sector
stimulus. That would not put us back into a downwards spiral, but it would mean that any
recovery could be shorter, weaker, and more erratic than it otherwise should be.

In summary, I will argue that unconventional monetary policy should be thought about in terms
of its impact on specific credit markets as well as its general impact on portfolios. In other
words, we should focus analytically on the direct market impacts of targeted credit market
interventions at least as closely as, if not rather than, on the gross sums 'spent' on QE. So doing
leads to the conclusion that the Bank’s QE will not lead to unacceptably high inflation at any
time horizon - a more empirically justified view than the forecasts generated by mechanistic
monetarism. This approach also implies that QE policy, if needed in future, might increase its
effectiveness by buying selected assets beyond gilts, as pursued by central banks in some other
countries.

The limitations of the UK financial markets for financing of domestic non-financial corporations,
however, have been brought into sharp relief by QE's practical constraints in that regard. This is
one area where there is an uncomfortable parallel with Japan’s situation in the 1990s: the
relative limits in the UK on the availability of non-bank financing for smaller companies may
constrain the emergence of a sustainable private-sector led recovery. Such structural problems
due to the underdevelopment of the UK domestic credit market is another reason that the
excessive concentration and other structural deficiencies of the UK financial system should be

3

addressed directly – that is independently of and in addition to the compelling arguments for so
doing to promote financial stability.

Unconventional measures in response to credit crisis – It is worth understanding the
circumstances under which QE and other unconventional monetary policy measures were
undertaken in late 2008 and earlier this year. Credit markets were locking up in ways and to a
degree that was completely unexpected, even by those who forecast a recession or crash, with
asset prices across almost the entire range of investments and countries moving downwards
together, and liquidity disappearing. Interest rates were being cut aggressively, but the severity
of the shock limited the positive impact of such measures in two ways: first, central banks
including the Bank of England would have cut rates more than they did, had they been able to do
so without running out of room as interest rates approached zero; second, and to my mind much
more importantly, the impact of interest rate cuts on the real economy was greatly diminished
because of the panic and dysfunction in the financial system.

Central banks understandably threw whatever it was they had at the problem, which included
guarantees to various intermediaries and on specific kinds of transactions, expanding facilities to
provide liquidity and to discount a wider range of assets for a wider range of counterparties than
normal, and creating central bank reserves to purchase assets in the secondary markets. QE is an
example of this last category, which for the Bank has meant purchasing long-term government
bonds from the private sector (mainly insurance companies and pension funds).

The goal of all these measures by all central banks was ultimately to turn around the economy
and prevent disaster. But the proximate target was to restore normalcy to credit markets. The
whole problem in credit markets stemmed from the fact that fewer and fewer securities and loans
were seen as being worth what they were previously thought to have been worth and that
investors felt unable to determine the relative worth of these assets due to problems with
transparency, liquidity, counterparty risk, and so on. Being unable to price assets was the key
issue turning this into a crisis; otherwise it would have been just a decline in security values,
harmful to consumption and investment in the short-term, but not a systemic threat or a source of

4

panic. So central banks including the Bank of England pursued policies to provide a secure
counterparty, reduce uncertainty, and provide sufficient liquidity for transactions to go through.
They made markets where markets were collapsing.3

The reason for recapping this is to emphasize what these unconventional measures including QE
were not. They were not attempts to expand the money supply per se, especially since the
velocity of money was declining and unpredictable during the crisis. They were not optimal
policy setting exercises, where an interest-rate setting rule told central banks by how much more
they should have cut rates below zero, and the amount of reserve creation or asset price
purchases was calibrated to be equivalent.4 The unconventional measures were first attempts to
get ahead of mounting credit market breakdowns with aggressive direct interventions, and then
to convince investors to move back into riskier asset classes, and thereby reflate the economy.

I give the analogy that normal monetary policy by interest rate setting is like driving a new
Range Rover down the M4 on a commute: one knows how long it will take to get to the desired
exit; the ride is smooth, well-marked and familiar; any particular causes of delays beyond normal
traffic are clearly visible and swiftly cleared. Unconventional monetary policy, including QE, is
like making the same trip but: doing so in an urgent hurry; driving a 10 year old used Vauxhall
Vectra with a cranky transmission; down a rural road because the M4 is closed; without a good
map or signage, and with all kinds of strange surprises blocking traffic. You will get where you
are going using QE, but you are not sure how long it will take to get there, and you will not enjoy
the ride. In other words, we can be confident that the coefficient of QE’s effect on nominal
income is positive, and therefore that the British economy would have been stuck in a far worse
place had QE not been implemented, but we cannot pretend to have precise knowledge of the
size or timing of QE’s impact.

Evidence against mechanistic monetarism and inflationary threats – Given this reality-based
understanding of QE, the punditry and prognostications that talk about high inflation threats from
3

Nishimura (2009) gives a similar take on what has been pursued by the Bank of Japan.
Interest rate rules are not robust guides to monetary policy in times of deflation and rapidly changing potential
output under any financial circumstances. See Kuttner and Posen (2004).

large-scale creation of bank reserves in response to a deflationary financial crisis seem rather
dubious. If the Bank could create inflation easily under such circumstances, and if the majority
of market participants and households believed that – not just the nutters – then we would be
more than halfway home. If only it were that easy. People are rational, and they realize that we
cannot do that.5 Long historical experience in the UK and elsewhere, supported by research
showing that what seems true in the data in this case is true, bears this out even for normal times,
let alone for times when the financial sector is so troubled and there is downward pressure on
wage growth and prices.

Remember, monetarism was tried as a guide to monetary policy in the UK and in the US in the
1980s. In both economies, as well as elsewhere around the world, the relationship between
narrow money (which central banks can control) and broad money (which central banks cannot)
was not dependable for setting policy, and the relationship between growth in either monetary
aggregate and inflation was even more dubious.6 Money might have some use as an indicator
variable (Nelson (2003); Goodhart (2007)), but as much of credit conditions as of inflation.
Even supposedly monetary targeting central banks, such as the Bundesbank and Swiss National
Bank, used monetary growth aggregates in this fashion and no more.7 Despite hundreds of
person-years of economists’ time with the latest econometric techniques available, sponsored by
institutions with monetarist leanings, no more robust relationships between monetary aggregates
and outcomes we actually care about in prices and output have been found. In fact, some recent
research suggests that even in the very long-run, the last refuge of economic theories from
empirical work, monetary growth is unrelated to prices (Sargent and Surico (2008)).

Yet, given the extremely large scale of asset purchases by many central banks today, amounting
to £175 billion in QE by the Bank of England, is there an inflationary threat? If one believes
seriously in a kind of mechanistic monetarism, then the key issue is how much has (and will)

5

Miles (2009) points out the converse, with which I also agree, that QE can have a positive effect on nominal
demand even in the absence of showing up in monetary aggregate growth (though one should watch that indicator
carefully).
6
The research of Benjamin Friedman, Charles Goodhart, and Frederic Mishkin, and their co-authors, in the 1980s
established this definitively, at least to most empirically driven observers’ satisfaction.

money growth exceeded the required to accommodate the real development of the economy. I
would like to present to you now some evidence from past periods of quantitative easing and
large-scale reserve creation, when there arguably was excessive monetary growth, and how little
it mattered for inflation. While one cannot prove a negative with data, it is to mind the best
approach to look empirically for parallel periods in order to understand and forecast from our
current circumstances, rather than to rely on an unsubstantiated belief in so-called first
principles, monetarist or otherwise.

There are various ways to measure such ‘excessive’ monetary growth. We identify periods of
potentially excessive monetary growth in the G7 economies by comparing a moving average of
the growth rate in broad money with the long-run historical average for a given economy. When
the annual growth rate of broad money moves outside a one-standard deviation confidence
interval from trend, we note that as a period of excessive growth.8 So for the UK, we can
identify six periods of excess money growth according to this measure, seen in Figure 1, all
ending before 2000.

Using this measure, what can we learn? Figure 1 for the UK and the parallel figures (2-7) for the
other G7 countries plot inflation outcomes over time. The dots on the lines indicate the actual
period of excessive growth, while the line continues for two years after the end of excessive
monetary growth.9 When looking at any of these G7 countries, the only periods where excessive
monetary growth led to sustained rises in inflation were during the early and mid-1970s. As we
all know, there was a lot more going wrong with macroeconomic policy in those times, and
many more upwards pressures on prices then, than we have today. In other instances, excessive
monetary growth was not followed by high inflation, and sometimes even followed by inflation
declines. Note that this sample includes instances of excessive monetary growth on this measure
during the last decade for France, Germany, Italy, and the US, so the absence of connection
8

This is similar to the procedure in Bordo and Jeanne (2002), who identify booms and busts by comparing a moving
average of the growth rate in asset prices with the long-run historical average to a confidence interval estimated with
respect to the mean and variance of the historical time series. We have intentionally set the bar low to find instances
of excessive monetary growth by saying even brief moves away from trend should be so classified. Redoing these
calculations so as to only capture instances where monetary growth is well above trend for several months or more
does not affect the pictures presented, though it reduces the number of cases.

I am grateful to Roger Vicquery for coming up with this presentation of the data.

between monetary growth and inflation is not an artifact of there having been no high monetary
growth instances in recent years.

Turning more directly to parallels with the current situation, the pattern remains the same. We
can identify two recent instances where central banks consciously created large amounts of
central bank reserves on a similar scale to that being pursued by the Bank under QE this past
year.10 Most similarly, the Bank of Japan officially began what it termed Quantitative Easing in
March 2001, buying huge numbers of Japanese government bonds and creating reserves in the
banking system. As can be seen in Figure 8, the spike in narrow money growth did not result in
an increase in broad money or credit growth, let alone an increase in the price level. Looking in
close up at the period of 1999-2003 (Figure 9) shows how Japan stayed mired in deflation
despite QE. The Bank of Japan has since indicated that it believes those QE measures
undertaken were largely ineffective, and certainly not inflationary (Shirakawa (2009)).

A second example is the massive intervention of the People’s Bank of China to maintain a fixed
exchange rate of the yuan against the US dollar over the period since the Asian Financial Crisis.
People’s Bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves (essentially dollars) increased at an annual
rate of 30% from 2003-08, despite a gradual devaluation of the yuan against the dollar over the
second half of this period. Leaving aside the international and financial implications of the
Chinese peg for tonight’s purposes, this should in theory have been inflationary. Yes, most of
these interventions were sterilized through issuance of government debt notes and central bank
bills, but on such a scale, some would have been expected to feed through into narrow money if
not into price setting via expectations and asset prices more broadly. As shown in figures 10
and 11 (again, looking at the longer period for China and close up on the period of highest
intervention), while narrow money did grow, albeit not as fast as foreign exchange reserves, that
did not result in high broad money growth or high inflation for China.

10

One could add in a third instance, the Federal Reserve response to the 9/11 attacks and the stock market crash of
2001, when the Fed injected liquidity aggressively. While the US (and world) economy was definitely buoyed by
those measures, their duration was short and their impact did not show up in inflation or broad money growth either.

8

I am not trying to prove with academic rigor (which these charts admittedly do not attain) that
money is endogenous or some other fundamental concept. What I am trying to do is make the
practical point that there is no evidence from relevant periods of UK or other major economies’
economic history that QE will result in high or sustained inflation. That conclusion is robust to
more intensive econometric investigation of the available data. That conclusion is also supported
by evidence from the period of QE in Japan earlier this decade which is the closest parallel to the
present situation and the QE policy pursued by the Bank of England this year. Thus, high
inflation is not what we should be worrying about.

A disturbing parallel to Japan in UK funding of non-financial corporations – So what
should be worried about? An economic policymaker should always be looking around the corner
for what risks lie ahead, beyond making her most accurate possible projection for the outlook.
Unfortunately, I have a clear candidate for the next target of concern: the ability of the UK
financial sector to provide sufficient support for the coming recovery.

Aggressive macroeconomic stimulus from fiscal and monetary policy was the right response to
the panic and subsequent recession, but there are limits to how far and how long public policy
stimulus can substitute for private sector sources of demand and growth.11 Even if
macroeconomic policy stimulus has not reached its limit, it would be preferable for many
reasons, not least of sustainability, for private demand to be the driver of growth after the worst
of a recession is over. That is also the natural response of a market economy, absent major
policy mistakes and financial disruptions.

On many fronts, including the end of financial panic, the coming end of destocking, positive
developments in labor markets and global demand, as well as the easing of credit conditions and
the normalization (if not more) of asset prices, the UK economy is now in line for that natural
recovery. That is the recovery that most other advanced economies are already beginning to
experience. Were UK households were to adjust their spending to save more out of their
11

These limits bind more strongly for fiscal policy than for monetary policy, and the more that fiscal policy credibly
respects its limits, the more room monetary policy has for maintaining a supportive stance. But that is a topic for
another day.

9

incomes for a while longer, that would be a drag on short-term growth, but it certainly would be
reasonable and constructive – and would not be a threat to lasting recovery. If government
programs continue to support the livelihoods and adjustment or retraining of the unemployed,
that is right, just, affordable, and positive for growth in the short-term. And if the Bank of
England continues to keep inflation over the medium-term at or near target, and thus the UK well
out of deflation – which we will – the basis for recovery is sound.

Credit conditions though, while easier than they were a few months ago thanks to the Bank’s and
the Government’s actions, are remain tight for many businesses. This reflects to some extent the
well-recognized fact that banks and other lenders are rebuilding their balance sheets (thanks in
part to salutary pressure from supervisors and regulators) and are tightening their lending
standards (thanks in part to salutary pressure from supervisors and regulators). Even here, there
are some positive signs in that better allocated credit will be a source for more sustainable
growth going forward, and that some UK financial institutions have raised new capital from
private sources limiting further shrinkage of balance sheets. In addition, credit always tightens
particularly for small- and medium-enterprises [SMEs] in a recession or when banks have
difficulty, so we should neither expect nor even want a return to the lending conditions of 200607 anytime soon.

Taking all that into account, however, the major question for me going forward about the UK
outlook remains the availability of credit to non-financial companies, particularly to SMEs, when
the upturn comes. Absent enough credit, correctly allocated, there will be insufficient
investment in the UK economy even when prospects improve, unavailability of sufficient funds
for businesses’ trade and short-term liquidity needs, and a reduction in the formation of new
businesses. This kind of dislocation for the real economy is what explains why financial crises
have historically been so costly, beyond their direct impact on wealth and short-term demand.
When there are persistent financial sector problems, there are persistent negative effects on
aggregate supply and on the potential rate of growth for an economy going forward, even after
the recession ends. Some of that harm is inevitable, especially when financial crises of the scale
we experienced occur, but the extent of the lasting damage is far from entirely out of our hands.

10

That is why in testimony before the UK Treasury Select Committee (2009c) as well as before the
US Congress’ Joint Economic Committee (2009a), I have argued that that the banking system
must be largely fixed before macroeconomic stimulus is needed to be withdrawn. The
alternative is likely to result in a still-born recovery, a double-dip (though less severe) recession,
and/or persistently slow growth. What we have learnt from the US Savings and Loan Crisis of
the 1980s, the Asian financial crisis of 1997-99 and from Japan’s Great Recession of the 1990s,
and what we are seeing right now, is that those economies which either fix their banking systems
quickly or which have a wide range of alternative channels to impaired banks through which to
provide capital to businesses, recover faster and stronger. It helps to have at least one spare tire
in the financial system, as Greenspan (1999) observed.

I am concerned because the financial system in the UK does not seem to have a spare tire for the
provision of capital to non-financial businesses when the banking system has popped a leak. QE
puts this unfortunate fact into clear relief. Other central banks were able to buy a wide range of
assets from the private sector, under the heading of ‘credit easing,’ as described in Bernanke
(2009), to good effect.12 The Bank of England, prior to my joining the MPC, decided to
purchase only gilts (essentially, being 95%+ of purchases) under the QE program. One of the
primary reasons given for so doing was the relative thinness of UK markets for corporate bonds,
commercial paper, and other corporate securities issued by non-banks. I appreciate the
constraint, but that limitation on QE reveals a major long-term structural problem in UK
financial markets which could be of potential harm as the UK economy begins to recover.

In fact, in this aspect the UK has an uncomfortable parallel with the Japanese financial system
when the Japanese economy began to recover in the mid-1990s and was unable to sustain it.
Severe macroeconomic policy mistakes also played a role there, and those are thankfully absent

12

Blanchard, et al (2009) describes the mechanism as follows: “Interventions, either through the acceptance of
assets as collateral, or through their straight purchase by the central bank, can affect the rates on different classes of
assets, for a given policy rate.” Gagnon (2009) gives a comparative description of what the major central banks did
purchase with what effects over the last two years. McCauley (2009) gives a succinct explanation of how QE
strictly on government bonds, assuming stock effects, differs from credit easing reliant on flow effects.

11

at present, so the parallels should not be exaggerated.13 The similarity between Japan then and
the UK now with regards to the financial system, however, should not be overlooked either, just
because other factors are not the same. The closer one looks, the more worrisome this specific
parallel becomes, given the concentration of the UK banking system in a few major, mostly still
troubled, banks, and the relative underdevelopment of alternative non-bank channels for getting
capital to non-financial businesses in the UK.

Look at the UK financial sector in comparative context. Table 1 presents a few aspects of
structures in the G7 economies financial markets prior to the current crisis. On the first row,
stock market capitalization as a percent of GDP places the UK up there with the US and Canada,
and thus putatively in the securities-based camp versus the more bank reliant economies of
Japan, Germany, et al. This is completely misleading, given that at the height of Japan’s bubble,
its stockmarket capitalization was more than three times the size of Japanese GDP (and thus
more than twice the Anglo-Saxons’ ratio), but the subsequent recession demonstrated the
Japanese difficulties with bank dependence. The second row shows that the UK has by far the
smallest private sector bond market capitalization relative to GDP, far below that of any other G7
economy. So that alternative credit channel is underdeveloped.

The third row presents the size of national markets in short-term private sector securities, that is
commercial paper and the like, and UK markets are again near the bottom, far closer to Japan on
this score than the US. Another missing tire. Finally, rows four and five show two different
measures of banking sector concentration, a direct measure of the assets of the three largest
banks as a share of assets of all commercial banks, and the number of banking institutions per
million persons. On these measures, too, the UK is far closer to Japan than to the US, and has
among the most concentrated banking system. Of course, the emergency measures undertaken
in response to the financial crisis have led to bank mergers, which have exacerbated the situation.
So not only are their few alternatives to the banks for financing in the UK, even within the
banking system there are few alternative banks within the UK if something goes wrong with
those major banks.
13

See Posen (2009b) and the references therein for a discussion of the policy lessons from Japan’s crisis.

12

In theory, every investment project, and thus every potential loan or security issuance, should be
assessed completely on its own merits, and individual loan officers at commercial banks or
intermediaries at investment banks make those decisions. Thus, it need not be inherent that
dominance of bank financing over alternative forms of capital raising for businesses, or that
concentration of the banking system rather than having multiple banks, will lead to credit
constraints on non-financial business in a given country. In practice, however, the absence of
alternative financial institutions and forms from an economy’s financial infrastructure does two
harms: first, when the previously dominant institutions are impaired, there is no ready substitute
for their lending; second, when the size minimum for businesses to get access to commercial
paper or bond markets is higher, more SME’s are highly vulnerable to business cycles to
temporary financial conditions. Thus, the inability of QE to get credit flowing through markets
other than gilts (except indirectly) implies that we should be concerned that the banking structure
in the UK may impede credit flowing more broadly in the recovery.

The short- and long-term needs to restructure UK banking and finance – Normally, when it
comes to comparative financial market performance, the UK is considered to be at or near the
top, especially given the British financial sector’s comparative advantage in international
competition for financial services and the justified dominance of the City as a global financial
center (with Edinburgh around as well). Embodying ‘Anglo-Saxon finance’ to the world,
however, is not the same thing as delivering finance domestically for non-financial corporations.
This point should not be a total surprise. Students of British economic history know that the
perceived failures of the City to provide sufficient capital to British business in favor of catering
to growth and export of financial services themselves is a long-standing theme, leading to the
Macmillan Commission of 1931 and the Wilson Commission of 1980, along with many political
and academic diatribes since the 1870s. While I am not in a position to evaluate those historical
contentions for exaggeration and bias, the divergence between the structure of the British
financial system today and the present and coming financing needs of British business is to me
apparent and troubling.

13

It is what any given sector or technology does to improve the functioning of the economy as a
whole that makes a significant difference to productivity growth, not what a strategic or highvalue added sector, even a very large one such as the financial sector in the UK, itself produces.
In the IT revolution in the 1990s, the source of the US productivity boom was the adoption and
utilization of IT throughout the economy, not the production of computers themselves. In the
coming years for the UK, it will be the ability of the financial system to support private capital
formation and investment in innovative activities that matters for national economic
performance, not the growth of financial sector employment or financial innovation that does not
yield benefits to non-financial institutions and households.

The functioning of the UK financial system is therefore of importance and direct relevance to the
work of the Monetary Policy Committee, as I understand our duties. A banking system as we
have in the UK today, with large segments still in public sector hands, a high degree of
concentration of assets, and still needing capital (though progress has been made on that front) is
a structure that bodes poorly for the sustainability of the coming economic recovery. It also is a
structure that could impede the return of trend growth in the UK to its previous rate, and which
could if things worsen put on persistent deflationary pressure (as the ongoing banking structural
problems did and do in Japan).

This is a completely independent reason for the critical re-evaluation of the current UK banking
structure, including of having too few big banks, than that raised by financial stability concerns –
though it points in largely the same direction.14 We need a financial system that is subject to
sufficient competitive pressure such that it provides enough traditional lending to non-financial
business, rather than one beset by too big to fail institutions who engage in relatively
unproductive speculative behavior. And we need this structural change in the UK in order to
generate sustainable growth in the coming years, not just to diminish systemic risk, though either
alone would be reason enough. The UK public debate should not limit itself to regulatory fixes
changing incentives for the current banking institutions, however constructive those regulatory
14

I share the broad thrust of Paul Volcker (2009) and Governor King’s (2009) views in this area, that too big to fail
is a major source of problems and that structural as well as regulatory reform is needed, as I have stated
independently in Posen (2009b) and elsewhere.

14

reforms may be. Given the extent of public guarantees, bailouts, and even ownership for the UK
banking system at present, we can choose to come out of this crisis with a better financial
infrastructure than with which the economy entered this crisis. The point of a financial system,
and of quantitative easing when that system breaks down, is to keep credit flowing.
