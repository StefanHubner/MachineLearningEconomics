A2. Methodology
Let 𝐶𝐶 be a matrix of Consumer Price Index where rows denote time and columns denote
different 2-digit COICOP items. Similarly, 𝑀𝑀 and 𝐷𝐷 are matrices containing 2-digit domestic
consumer price indices, import price indices and domestic producer price indices, where
the latter two are recorded from price quotes of firms in the economy. The import and
domestic producer prices indices have been obtained from the ONS at the 2-digit CPA
level, through an FOI request. ONS price indices are derived from price statistics for 20112022 at a monthly frequency. Services producer price indices are available quarterly, so
the exercise is conducted at a quarterly level. Services import price indices are available
for thirteen different categories which are manually matched to the 2-digit services CPA
categories. Data for the last period of 2022Q4 is not available at the disaggregate 2-digit
level and is projected from the disaggregate statistics for: current price and chain value
measures trade in services, and industry GVA. These series are projected using the
aggregate growth in aggregate trade in services and aggregate GVA.

The domestic and import shares in final household consumption are denoted by 𝐹𝐹𝑑𝑑 , a
diagonal matrix with the diagonal element containing the domestic share of household final
consumption of CPI Items. Each row contains the CPI items sequentially. 𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚 is a diagonal
matrix with the diagonal element containing the import share of household final
consumption of CPI items. The final household consumption shares are from supply-use
tables.
The domestic and import direct use matrices contain the expenditure on factors of
production (as a share of the value of output) and are denoted by 𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 and 𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚 for the CPI
basket and by 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑 and 𝐵𝐵𝑚𝑚 for the entire economy. They are available at the 2-digit CPA
level from the supply-use tables. They also include the value of compensation of
employees, taxes on products, taxes on production and gross operating surplus for each
CPA category. The main analysis uses the latest (2018) direct supply-use tables and the
sensitivity analysis uses the 2015 tables. The 2-digit import and domestic producer price
indices can be readily mapped to the 2-digit COICOP classification from a mapper
provided by the ONS. It enables a mapping from the supply-use tables and import and
domestic price indices to the consumer price classification.
Let 𝑋𝑋 𝑇𝑇 denote the transpose of matrix 𝑋𝑋. With this notation in hand, CPI inflation can be
decomposed into cost and profit components. We will denote the residual profits of
retailers selling consumer products by 𝑉𝑉. Then the CPI can be written as the sum of all unit
costs incurred by the domestic sellers of that item and their residual profit:
𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 ≡ 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑 𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 + 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚 𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇 + 𝑉𝑉 𝑇𝑇

(1)

𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇
𝑀𝑀 + 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇
𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 ≡ 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 + 𝐵𝐵𝑚𝑚

(2)

Similarly, the domestic producer price index is the sum of all unit costs incurred by the
producer and the residual profit that the producer retains in the business:

We do not typically have direct measures of residual profits 𝑉𝑉, 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑 . They can however be
inferred from the CPI and PPI identities of equations 1 and 2 respectively because we
have the other variables in the. Therefore the first step in the decomposition exercise is to
infer the matrix of retailer residual profits 𝑉𝑉 𝑇𝑇 ≡ 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑 𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 + 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚 𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇 − 𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 and the matrix of
𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇
domestic supplier’s residual profit matrix 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ≡ 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 + 𝐵𝐵𝑚𝑚
𝑀𝑀 − 𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 using data for each
CPA 2-digit category from the prices and supply-use tables.

To understand the sources of CPI inflation after accounting for the domestic supply chain,
the CPI index needs to be written in terms of primary and imported factors of production.
Let [𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ]−1 be the inverse of a matrix that contains the difference between an identity
matrix 𝐼𝐼 and the transposed domestic use matrix 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 . Then the domestic producer price
index can be solved for in terms of the imported prices, import use, domestic use and

residual profits. Taking 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 to the LHS and multiplying by the inverse matrix [𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ]−1
on both sides of equation (2) gives the domestic price index for the 2-digit CPA item as:
𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇
𝑀𝑀 + [𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ]−1 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇
𝐷𝐷𝑇𝑇 ≡ [𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ]−1 𝐵𝐵𝑚𝑚

(3)

Having already solved for 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 , this second step gives the domestic producer prices in terms
of import prices and residual profit margins.
The domestic producer prices can be substituted from equation 3 into the consumer price
identity of equation 1. Then the domestic CPI consists of import costs and profit
components as shown below:
𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇
𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 ≡ 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚 𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇 + 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑 [𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ]−1 𝐵𝐵𝑚𝑚
𝑀𝑀 + 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑 [𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 ]−1 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 + 𝑉𝑉 𝑇𝑇

(4)

This third step shows that the domestic CPI index is a sum of the direct contribution of
imports in the CPI basket (first term on the RHS), the indirect contribution of imports
(through domestic inputs that use imported inputs themselves), the residual profits of
domestic suppliers (third term) and the residual profits of domestic producers (last term).
The fourth step accounts for differences in the share of imports for final consumption in the
CPI basket: 𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 = 𝐹𝐹𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚𝑇𝑇 𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 . The CPI does not distinguish between domestic and
imported varieties of consumer items, but we know that about 80 percent of varieties for
final consumption are domestically purchased. As long as prices of final import
consumption are rising faster than their domestic counterparts, the results provide a lower
bound for external factors as a source of inflation.
𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 = 𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚𝑇𝑇 𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 �

More generally, we can extend the identity to include other factors of production that are in
the supply-use tables. These include energy (denoted by 𝑒𝑒 for energy and by 𝐸𝐸 for the
price index of energy), imported inputs (other than energy), taxes on products and
production (denoted by 𝑡𝑡 for taxes as a share of the value of output and by 𝑇𝑇 for the tax
rate), compensation of employees (denoted by 𝑤𝑤 for workers as an input and 𝑊𝑊 as the
wage rate). The supply-use table also contain the gross operating surplus for each 2-digit
CPA category. This can be used to determine the profit margin from the residual profits
because 𝑉𝑉 𝑇𝑇 ≡ 𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑣𝑣 Π𝑇𝑇 where 𝐴𝐴𝑉𝑉 is the gross operating surplus as a share of the value of the
2-digit CPA output or the profit margin is inferred as Π𝑇𝑇 = [𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇𝑣𝑣 ]−1 𝑉𝑉 𝑇𝑇 . Proceeding similarly,
domestic suppliers’ profit margins can be inferred as Π𝑇𝑇 = [𝐵𝐵𝑣𝑣𝑇𝑇 ]−1 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 where 𝐵𝐵𝑉𝑉 is the
gross operating surplus as a share of the value of the 2-digit CPA produced by the
domestic supplier. Mapping the residual profits from step 1 to the profit is the fourth step in
the exercise.

Finally, separating out final energy bills of households, the four steps above enable the
following CPI decomposition as the final step in the exercise.

where the first line contains imported varieties (other than energy) for final consumption by
households, the second line is the final, direct and indirect energy and imported inputs’
contributions, the third line contains the direct and indirect wage costs, the fourth line
contains the inferred profit margins of retailers and domestic suppliers, and the last line is
the taxes on products and production. Equation 6 gives the main findings reported in the
main text.
Data on domestic energy prices come from the ONS provided 2-digit PPI data and data on
imported energy prices come from BEIS. Wage rates are obtained for each 2-digit CPA
category (which maps one-to-one to the 2-digit SIC classification). Energy prices and
wages are available at a monthly frequency from the ONS.
Tax shares in prices are derived from the price series using the tax share in the supply-use
tables. The tax share in the supply-use tables is small compared to the average share of
production taxes in the economy, so sensitivity analysis is conducted with the average tax
share in the economy, but this makes very little quantitative or qualitative difference to the
main findings, so we do not reproduce the analysis here.
