Sustainability of monetary and exchange rate policies

Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, let me begin by saying that it is a real pleasure to be here with you
today in Macau and to participate with such distinguished central bank colleagues in your conference.

One of the very agreeable things about coming to the other side of the world to participate in an event like
this is that it enables me to step back from the daily hubbub of my office, the financial markets in the City of
London, and the media, and reflect in a broader way on what it is we are all actually trying to do. It is in fact
much more agreeable than working!

In a broad sense, of course, our ultimate objective as central bankers is clear, and it is reflected in your
conference title when you talk about "leading the way to sustainable growth". I would add high rates of
employment and rising living standards to that objective.

Very often in the past, certainly in my own country, but not just in my own country, that fundamental objective
was seen to be largely a matter of demand management – of pumping up demand by expansionary fiscal
and monetary policies – with too little regard to the structural, supply-side, capacity of our economies to meet
that demand. There is not much that overall fiscal policy, still less monetary policy, can do directly to affect
the supply-side capacity of the economy: they operate essentially on the demand side. And our recurrent
experience showed that excessive demand growth spilled over into inflation and a worsening balance of
payments which ultimately had to be corrected – the infamous boom and bust cycle. This macro-economic
instability damaged the supply side of the economy, with a worse outcome over time in terms of our ultimate
policy objective. It is now very widely understood that "stability is a necessary condition for sustainable
growth" and that, of course, has become the universal central banker’s mantra.

But the question is stability of what? You obviously cannot sensibly aim to stabilise everything. The aim has
to be sustainable growth of the economy as a whole. But that cannot mean stable growth for every sector of
the economy or for every business enterprise. Consumer demands change over time and so, too, do
technologies and production techniques. Open market competition to identify such changes, and to exploit
them to meet social needs more efficiently, is a vital driver of improvement on the supply side of the
economy. At the micro-economic level, that means that particular sectors and individual businesses will
continually rise and fall; and that is why established producers everywhere often see new competition,
perhaps especially international competition, as an unwelcome threat. But at the macro-economic level what
we have to remember is that every dollar earned is a dollar available to be spent or reinvested back into the
economy, whoever earns it. So, at the macro-economic level, competition – the driver of economic progress
– is a positive sum game; it increases the potentially sustainable growth rate nationally, regionally, and
internationally. How far each country individually is able to take advantage of this increased potential
depends upon how flexibly it can adapt to changes in comparative productive advantage – which in turn
depends upon the supply–side characteristics of our separate economies. But there is no doubt that we all

stand to benefit. That is why I have always believed fundamentally in the principle of free trade and open
capital markets which enhance competition. It is why I have always welcomed the rapid growth we have
seen in the emerging market economies – and why incidentally I look forward to China’s accession to the
WTO.

We cannot then sensibly aim to obstruct structural changes. But nor can we realistically hope to avoid all
shorter-term fluctuations, associated with the business cycle for example or as a result simply of random
shocks. What we are looking for is a stable macro-economic framework for the economy as a whole, which
will help to moderate rather than aggravate shorter-term fluctuations, and one within which change can occur
in response to longer-term real economic factors, undistorted by unnecessary, erratic, movements
particularly in nominal values.

In a totally closed, national, economy I suspect that the most effective way of achieving this would be to aim
to stabilise the rate of consumer price inflation – at some very low level representing effective price stability.
We might, certainly, as an intermediate step aim to stabilise the rate of growth of the money supply, if we
were confident that the demand for money was sufficiently stable and predictable, but the reason for
targeting the growth of the money supply would ultimately be to stabilise the rate of inflation, so the
distinction is operational rather than substantive.

But it is important to understand that effective price stability would not be intended simply as an end in itself.
In order to maintain price stability, what in fact we would need to do is to keep overall demand in the
economy continuously broadly in line with supply-side capacity, so that the actual rate of inflation is really a
measure, or barometer if you like, of our success in maintaining macro-economic stability in a much wider
sense. If we succeed in maintaining such stability, that would also contribute, indirectly, to improving the
supply side of the economy by reducing nominal uncertainty as a factor in spending or saving or investment
decisions and thereby improving resource allocation.

Macro-economic stability in this sense can of course be affected by either overall fiscal policy or by monetary
policy. But frequent fiscal policy changes - to tax rates or expenditure programs – can generate microeconomic uncertainties so that short-run macro-economic stabilisation is normally left primarily to monetary
policy. It is important nevertheless that the two arms of policy pull in the same general direction to avoid
unwanted sectoral or related regional distortions.

In a totally closed economy therefore the objective of macro-economic stabilisation and the respective roles
of fiscal and monetary policy would be reasonably clear.

But none of us – very fortunately in any wider context – actually lives in a closed economy. We are all
vulnerable to external shocks to varying degrees, including of course, increasingly, shocks resulting from
international capital flows. Free trade and open capital markets do, as I noted earlier, bring huge benefits in

terms of supply-side improvements from which we all, potentially, stand to gain. But there is no doubt that
economic globalisation can at times massively complicate our national efforts at macro-economic
stabilisation and it is this problem which I should like to address in the rest of my remarks.

A key issue is how far we can protect our internal macro-economic stability through our choice of exchange
rate regime. My short answer to that question – from the UK’s experience – is that there is, sadly, no ideal
solution!

The effective options range from floating, through some form of adjustable peg, to a quasi-fixed exchange
rate by way of a currency board or, ultimately, full monetary union. Each option has its pros and cons.

Let me start with floating. At first blush the idea of allowing the exchange rate to take the strain, as a kind of
buffer, insulating the domestic economy from shocks emanating abroad appears very attractive.
Unfortunately it does not necessarily work like that. A floating exchange rate may move erratically in
response to market news, causing unwarranted movements in the real exchange rate. That, of course, may
be an important influence on domestic costs and prices; it may affect the relative competitiveness of
domestically and foreign-produced goods and services leading to changes in the net external trade position,
affecting aggregate demand in the domestic economy. So the insulation provided by a floating exchange rate
may prove to be more apparent than real.

The UK has been floating since 1992. For some years we experienced very little tension between our
domestic and external policy needs. But then, from the autumn of 1996 we saw a sudden appreciation of
some 20-25% in our Effective Exchange Rate against the core European currencies, and seemingly, largely
related to uncertainties about the future characteristics of the European single currency. Whatever the
reason the strengthening of the exchange rate had a dampening effect on the domestic price level, and a
subsequent deterioration of our trade balance (accentuated over the past year or so by the global economic
slowdown) reduced aggregate demand in the economy. Monetary policy accordingly needed to be less
restrictive than would otherwise have been appropriate to offset these effects on domestic demand. The aim
was not to achieve a particular level of the exchange rate but to compensate for its deflationary impact.
When the exchange rate weakens – as we anticipate that it will in due course – then monetary policy will at
some point need to offset that influence in the opposite direction. But in the meantime we have had to
manage as best we can a severe imbalance between different sectors of the economy, with the
internationally exposed sectors taking a considerable hammering. Despite reasonable macro-economic
stability in the economy as a whole, the environment has been anything but stable for those sectors.

For a period before 1992 we sought to manage the exchange rate, initially by informally shadowing the DM
and subsequently by pegging sterling within the framework of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Both these episodes ended in tears, essentially for the same reasons: attempting to manage the exchange
rate required us to pursue macro-economic policies which were inconsistent with our own domestic macro4

economic needs. In the first case shadowing the DM involved accentuating a domestic boom; in the second
case our membership of the ERM, at a time when reunification required abnormally tight monetary policy in
Germany, involved us in pursuing an unnecessarily restrictive monetary policy deepening and prolonging
recession. In that case, too, the formal commitment made exit more difficult, the exchange rate fell very
sharply, and we made a very substantial financial loss as a result of massive foreign exchange intervention
seeking to defend the ultimately indefensible. While they lasted these regimes provided a degree of nominal
exchange rate stability which no doubt helped the internationally exposed sectors of the economy. But the
price ultimately was substantially increased instability in the economy as a whole.

Of course, some commentators have argued that the problem we had within the ERM was the exchange rate
at which we entered rather than the form of the arrangements. I am not convinced. The divergence between
our domestic policy needs and those in Germany was such that it seems unlikely to me that any plausible
difference in the exchange rate initially chosen for the peg would have made very much difference. But in
any event the range of uncertainty surrounding the choice of a sustainable peg is an important part of the
problem with any pegged or fixed rate regime.

The UK has not recently experienced a fully fixed exchange rate regime – although we remain a potential
member of European Monetary Union. But the basic economic pros and cons of a fixed rate regime are
somewhat similar. Essentially the very real advantages are nominal exchange rate certainty within the Eurozone – which accounts for some 50% of our external trade as well as participation of the domestic economy
in broader, more liquid, pan-European financial markets. (The City of London is, of course, already a full
participant in the European financial markets – indeed it is the major contribution that we can make at this
stage in the development of the new currency.) These are very considerable potential economic benefits
which will lead to more efficient resource allocation across the euro area. The potential downside is the risk
that at times the single European monetary policy will not meet the domestic monetary policy needs in all the
individual participating countries – in other words that there will be problems of sectoral and regional
divergence which are very familiar in larger economies at the national level, but on a larger, regional
European, scale. The jury is still out on this question.

Based on our experience it seems clear, as I say, that there is no clear best solution, applicable at all times
for all currencies, to reconciling the inherent problem of potential conflict between the needs of domestic and
external stability.

The choice depends very much upon the country’s particular circumstances.

Floating may be more attractive to a country which has a small tradeable sector relative to the size of its
domestic economy, but in that case it will need an effective nominal domestic anchor, such as a money
supply or inflation target; and it will need an institutional structure – typically an independent central bank – to
reinforce the credibility of the commitment to that nominal anchor.

At the other extreme a fixed rate regime may be more attractive to smaller, more open, economies or where
a credible domestic macro-economic framework is difficult to establish, for example, for historical or political
reasons. But in this case it is crucial to recognise that domestic policy must be totally and unreservedly
committed to maintaining the fixed exchange rate. It is an extremely demanding regime but one which can
work well – as we have seen in Hong Kong – where there is a high degree of supply-side flexibility to act as
an alternative external shock absorber.

It has become increasingly fashionable recently to exclude anything between these two extreme positions –
an actively managed float or a pegged rate regime – as an unviable middle ground. It is argued essentially
that because they do not exert a sufficient discipline on policy in either direction, or therefore represent a
sufficiently clear policy framework, they tend to intensify market tensions when a divergence between the
policy needs of domestic and external stability does in fact arise.

I am reluctant to accept that so-called "corner" view in any absolute sense. When tension does arise
between external and domestic objectives, you cannot avoid the impact on domestic policy altogether even
with a floating exchange rate regime – as I explained in the context of our own recent experience. It may help
to reduce that tension to attempt to manage the float to some degree, by supporting appropriate domestic
policy action with exchange market intervention, though I agree that such intervention may serve as little
more than a signal where a currency is internationally widely traded and held. Similarly there can, I believe,
be circumstances in which domestic discipline may be reinforced by an exchange rate peg, but it is vital in
that case that the authorities should identify a clear exit strategy before serious tensions are allowed to
emerge. That – I know from our own experience – is much easier said than done!

Mr Chairman, these dilemmas are certainly not new. But clearly they are liable to be accentuated by the
massive increase in global capital flows over recent years, which has not only complicated the choice
between alternative possible exchange rate regimes but also made the management of any of those regimes
substantially more difficult.

So there is a further question we need to address which is whether there is anything we can do to reduce the
volatility of these massive capital flows beyond pursuing disciplined macro-economic policies. That of course
is the subject of a whole series of conferences on its own; and there is certainly a good deal that we can do.
Let me conclude by mentioning some of the items on my own shopping list in this context.

First, at the recipient end, a crucial condition for living with financial globalisation is improvement of market
structures to ensure that capital inflows are productively employed. That involves attention to structural
issues, such as accountancy standards, bankruptcy laws, and governance questions. It involves appropriate
sequencing of capital account liberalisation – and arrangements to ensure that the particular risks to the
borrowing country, for example, attaching to volatile short-term inflows are properly recognised – and
reflected in the price paid by the borrower. That in turn involves effective management of foreign currency

assets and liabilities in particular, including management of their relative liquidity, by both the public and
private sectors. It involves, also, ensuring that borrowers, and their creditors, are unambiguously clear as to
who is ultimately responsible for the liability at the time it is taken on. It involves increased attention more
generally to the soundness of financial systems – which is to be the subject of our discussion this afternoon.
And perhaps above all it involves improved transparency – of policies, of standards, and of financial and
economic data - to enable investors and lenders to make informed assessments of risks.

But there is a great deal too that the international financial community can do, as it were from the provider
end. This includes the intensive efforts being made, particularly by the IMF, to encourage sound macroeconomic and structural policies – and greater transparency – in all IMF member countries. It includes
intensified efforts by financial regulators particularly – at the national level but also working collectively
through the new Financial Stability Forum, the Basel Committee and IOSCO for example – to improve
prudential standards of financial behaviour. And it includes the provision of official financial support to
countries that are pursuing sound policies – in parallel with continuing private finance, on which the risks
would have been reduced both through the parallel official finance itself and through official international
endorsement of the borrowing country’s policies. In this context I think we in the official sector may have
placed too much emphasis in international discussions on "bailing in" the private sector – which can sound
ominous, even threatening – where what we really need is recognition of our mutual interest in public-private
sector partnership.

It is a heavy and complex agenda which is being very actively pursued in many different international
groupings, involving both the industrial and emerging countries, across a broad front. We are I believe
steadily moving towards consensus or many of the issues and this is "leading the way towards sustainable
economic growth" into the next millennium. In the meantime we are collectively having to manage the
consequences of the recent global financial disturbances and their economic after-effects. Happily we have
recently been making progress on that too, particularly in many of the emerging countries here in Asia.
