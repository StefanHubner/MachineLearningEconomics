The Bank of England is back in Leicester. Between 1844 and 1872 there was a branch of
the Bank of England in Leicester, located in Gallowtree Gate. Sadly it operated at a loss,
in part because the Agent lived in style driving about town in a carriage and pair with two
men in livery, and the branch was closed. Only six years ago did we re-establish our
links with the City through the creation of a new Agency in the East Midlands. The
purpose of that Agency - staffed by four members of the Bank who work in rather less
style than their predecessors - is to listen to you and other businesses about what is
happening on the ground.
The reports of our Agents around the country are crucial to the Monetary Policy
Committee. The information we receive from you, and our other eight thousand business
contacts around the country, are key pieces in the large jigsaw puzzle of the UK economy
that we assemble each month in order to see the big picture.
Some of the statistical fog hanging over the British economy lifted a week or so ago with
the publication of a new picture of demand and output over a number of years. The
official statisticians have redrawn the profile of growth in different sectors of the
economy. In particular, the data for spending and output in the first half of this year now
appear more consistent. But October is often a month in which fog turns into storms. So
it is worth asking whether the remaining statistical fog enveloping the UK economy
foreshadows stormy economic weather ahead. After a decade of unparalleled stability of
both growth and inflation, it is time to take stock.
For much of the 60 years since the end of the Second World War, Britain experienced a
succession of economic cycles - variously described as stop-go or boom-bust. On
average these were larger than the fluctuations experienced by other major industrial
economies. Not only was our growth rate lower, it was also more variable. But the past
decade has seen a remarkable shift of fortunes. In the 10 years from the second quarter of
1992, the average annual growth rate of GDP was 2.9%, above the post-war average of
2.5%. Following the adoption of an inflation target in late 1992, inflation averaged 2.5%,

3
the lowest for a generation, and never deviated more than one percentage point from that
average. Unemployment fell from almost 10% to around 3% on the claimant count, its
lowest level for almost three decades, and has now been virtually unchanged for twenty
months, by far its longest period of stability. The terms of trade moved in Britain’s
favour, raising our national standard of living. And output has risen in every single
quarter since the middle of 1992, something that is true of no other G7 economy.
Why were the 1990s so successful? And can that success continue? Four features of our
economy lie behind this improved performance. First, the new monetary framework based on an explicit target for inflation, a high degree of transparency, and, since 1997,
independence of the Bank of England - made it clear to everyone that monetary policy
was, and would continue to be, targeted on maintaining low and stable inflation.
Second, a substantial fiscal consolidation turned a deficit of 8% of GDP in 1993 into a
sustainable position for the public finances based on a set of clear rules for government
debt. Third, a continuing programme of supply-side reforms, over a period of 20 years,
made it possible to reduce unemployment without generating higher inflation. Fourth,
although the unexpected twists and turns of the world economy did pose real challenges
to monetary policy, especially in the latter half of the decade, those shocks tended to
average out over time rather than cumulate in either an upward or downward spiral. In
other words, the economic surprises alternated between good one year and bad the next,
rather than adding up to “one damn thing after another”. In that sense, Lady Luck smiled
on us.
Of course, we were not alone in enjoying the 1990s. In the United States growth was so
rapid that at least two authors wrote books entitled “The Roaring Nineties” and another
chose the title “The Fabulous Decade”. In contrast, continental Europe experienced slow
growth and heart-searching over structural reforms. As with much else, our economic
performance lay somewhere between the excited exuberance of the United States and the
relative disappointment of continental Europe. So the UK experienced a non-inflationary
consistently expansionary - or “nice” - decade; a decade in which growth was a little
above trend, unemployment fell steadily, and, supported by the improved terms of trade,

4
real take-home pay rose without adding to employers’ costs, thus allowing consumption
to grow at above trend rates without putting upward pressure on inflation.
Will the next ten years be as nice? That is unlikely. The terms of trade will probably not
rise as much in future as they have in recent years – about 10% since 1996 when sterling
started to appreciate – not least because sterling’s effective exchange rate has fallen by
around 7% since the turn of the year. Moreover, there is no longer the margin of spare
capacity that has provided a buffer for policy over much of the past decade. So when
shocks, as they will, hit our economy it is almost inevitable that there will be somewhat
greater volatility of both output and inflation than the remarkable stability to which we
have become used in recent years.
But the case for realism about what we should expect is not a case for pessimism; rather
the opposite. The macroeconomic framework in this country is sound and proven. And
the real benefit from Britain's new-found position of macroeconomic stability is that it
provides an opportunity to improve our supply performance - to boost productivity,
education and enterprise in order to generate the resources needed to raise living
standards. Such improvements are, in the long run, both more important and more
glamorous than the rather dull and repetitive role of the Bank of England in trying to
maintain macroeconomic stability. The Bank of England is only the referee; you are the
players.
Unlike countries such as the United States, which has witnessed a significant and
seemingly durable rise in productivity growth, in Britain the underlying rate of increase
of output produced for each hour worked has remained broadly stable. We can take some
comfort from the latest revisions to the National Accounts which show that productivity
growth was not as depressed as previously thought, but it still remains close to its longrun trend of around 2% a year, insufficient to close the productivity gap between
ourselves and our major competitors.

5
Of course the Bank of England has to look to improve the quality and professionalism of
its own activities. And, together with the Court of the Bank, the new executive team is
exploring ways to enhance the effectiveness of our operations. Improving our market
intelligence, refocusing our financial stability role, and making central services more
professional, are examples of ways in which the Bank aims, in all its activities, to pursue
standards of excellence, as it has in monetary policy. There is one additional area where
change could prove beneficial. After the Monetary Policy Committee decides on the
level of interest rates, that decision must be implemented in the money markets. The
Bank will be carrying out a review of its money market operations with a view to
improving and simplifying them, and reducing overnight volatility in those markets. The
Bank’s Markets Director, Paul Tucker, will be consulting the market shortly.
For the United Kingdom as a whole, pressing on with reforms to raise productivity is
essential to future prosperity. The strategy which the MPC has pursued in recent years stimulating domestic demand to compensate for weak external demand in the face of a
strong exchange rate – carries the risk that there could be a sharp correction to the level
of consumer spending at some point in the future. That risk is exacerbated by the
continued strength of the housing market and associated borrowing that we have seen in
recent weeks. It is possible that such weakness of domestic demand might be offset by
an improvement in productivity, although as yet few signs of that are observable.
Three lessons from past monetary policy experience are relevant to the present position.
First, monetary policy can target only the aggregate price level. And inflation
expectations are now firmly anchored on the inflation target. But the risk of a correction
to consumer spending derives from the possibility of sharp movements in relative prices,
particularly of assets. Expectations of the key relative prices within the economy, such as
asset prices and the exchange rate, are volatile and difficult to measure, and changes in
them are often desirable signals to producers and consumers alike. So it would be a
mistake to target those relative prices. But understanding how they affect the
expectations and spending decisions of the players in the economy is an essential part of
monetary policy.

6

Second, it is easier to measure the money value of spending and output in the economy
than to split it into estimates of “real” output, on the one hand, and price indices, on the
other. That is why the latest data revisions have altered the picture of real growth over
recent years, leaving estimated money spending and output broadly unchanged. In such
circumstances it is sensible to focus on money spending. Indeed, the success of the new
monetary framework can be seen in the stability not just of retail price inflation but also
of the growth rate of domestic demand in money terms. Over the past few years the
annualised growth rate of nominal domestic demand has remained in the range of 4½% to
5½%, a much greater degree of stability than experienced for many decades.
Third, it is extremely difficult to anticipate the future path of interest rates. That is
because the Monetary Policy Committee sets rates in response to news in the economy,
and that news is inherently difficult to forecast. Each month the Committee makes a
careful assessment of the outlook for inflation, and it is that which will guide our
decisions on the appropriate level of interest rates. It is over 3 1/2 years since interest
rates were last raised - the longest such period since Bank Rate was held constant at 2%
through the 1940s. At some point reducing the present degree of monetary stimulus will
be necessary in order to keep inflation on track to meet the target. The timing of any
such decision will reflect our judgment of the outlook for inflation. Listening to our
business contacts and learning from our visits around the UK is an important input into
that judgment.
To retain the unrivalled degree of stability that we achieved during the “nice” decade
will be an even more difficult challenge for the future. The present monetary and fiscal
frameworks provide a seaworthy policy vessel, but, as all sailors know, fog, especially
statistical fog, can be dangerous. So we must hope that Lady Luck will continue to smile
on us.
