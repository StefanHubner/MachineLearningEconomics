Looking through a glass
onion: lessons from the
2022 LDI intervention

Andrew Hauser

Four lessons from the LDI intervention
1. LDI and the dash for cash were not isolated symptoms of a polycrisis world:
we are entering a new era of systemic liquidity risk, originating in non-banks
and capital markets
2. Bagehot still applies. Central banks have to be the backstop, not the
frontstop. But the divide between public and private insurance is a key
social choice. Must it keep happening by trial and error?
3. Central banks need new tools for a new era – capable of getting liquidity to
new places, through new channels, in a stress. One size will not fit all.

4. Careful design is needed to maximise effectiveness while minimising risks:
to the stance of monetary policy; to public funds; and to market incentives.

Dysfunction in core markets causes systemic liquidity risk
Exogenous shock (pandemic, war, etc.)

Financial System

…but scale of adjustment
overwhelms capacity/willingness
of banks/intermediaries to
Central banks
warehouse risk…
supply liquidity via
traditional tools
targeted at the
banking system…
Commercial
banks
Central banks

…so central banks may
have to intervene directly
in core markets

Shock triggers price volatility,
which leads to margin calls,
fund redemptions, etc.
…which reveals leverage and thin
liquidity buffers in non-banks and
leads to…
…a rush to the exit in
normally liquid financial
instruments…
…which spreads the liquidity shock
from one sector to the wider financial
system…
…and threatens the stability of core
financial markets…

These
amplification
mechanisms
worsen the
volatility in
financial markets

…instability in
core markets
create new
shocks for
the real
economy

Public vs private insurance against non-bank liquidity risk
(1) Private sector firms should
be responsible for self-insuring
against a wide range of risk
scenarios…
(3) But excessive public insurance
would be costly and dampen private
incentives to manage risks

(2) Public authorities /
central banks have a role in
backstopping against
severe stability-threatening
risks…

Frequency

(4) And important public
debate needed to
establish a consistent
private resilience level
across non-banks

Monetary stability
purchases (QE)

Purpose and
governance

Aimed at reducing the risk of a self-reinforcing price spiral triggered by
LDI vulnerabilities. FPC recommended action to tackle financial
stability risk; MPC informed, in line with the Concordat regarding
balance sheet operations; Bank executive implemented.

QE aimed at easing monetary conditions in
pursuit of the inflation target. MPC voted on
quantity targets; Bank executive implemented.

Duration of
purchases and
exit plan

Temporary: purchases undertaken for only as
long as required by financial stability issue; and unwound through
sales back to market in timely
and orderly way once dysfunction resolved.

High level targets for purchase, unwind and
sales programmes voted on by MPC
as part of its monetary policy process.

Asset selection

Targeted: at assets most affected by
financial stability issue.

Appropriately broad based to
achieve monetary policy goals.

Pricing

Backstop pricing: to ensure the facility did not unduly interfere with
price discovery or substitute for the need for market participants to
manage their own risks over the medium term.

Priced to deliver
MPC-determined quantity targets.
