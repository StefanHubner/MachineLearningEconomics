THE INSTITUTIONS OF MONETARY POLICY
Mervyn King∗

President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
To have one central bank governor address you today may be regarded as a
misfortune, but to invite two looks like carelessness!
It is a great honour to be invited by this year’s President-Elect, Marty Feldstein, to
deliver the Ely lecture. Marty has been my teacher, mentor, colleague and friend for
over thirty years, and I never cease to be amazed by the energy and imagination which
he devotes to the study of economic problems.
I got to know Marty during my time as a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard in 1971. The
Kennedy Scholarships form one part of Britain's national memorial to President
Kennedy. The other part is an acre of land, now American territory, at Runnymede.
At the ceremony to open the Runnymede memorial in 1965, Prime Minister Harold
Wilson remarked about President Kennedy that "his eyes were on the horizon, but his
feet were on the ground”. Almost thirty years earlier Richard T. Ely published his
autobiography entitled "Ground under Our Feet". Whereas I found the experience of
coming from Europe to the United States intellectually liberating and exhilarating, a
hundred years earlier Ely found academic freedom by making the reverse journey. As
he wrote in his autobiography, “When I first went to Germany I seemed to breathe a
new and exhilarating atmosphere of freedom … [which] did not exist in [American
universities]” (Ely, 1938). Two journeys, separated by a hundred years, reveal much
about what occurred in Europe and America between them. Upon his return, Ely

2

"undertook to draw up a project for the formation of a society to be called ‘The
American Economic Association’, which should be broad enough to appeal to all the
younger economists who, irrespective of their personal views, felt the stirring of the
new life in economics”. His actions helped the AEA to develop into the great
institution it is today.
I have the privilege to work for another great institution, the Bank of England. And,
as we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Ely's birth, I thought it would be appropriate
to choose as the theme of my lecture today the role that institutions play in the
conduct of monetary policy. In brief, I want to argue that the core of the monetary
policy problem is uncertainty about future social decisions resulting from the
impossibility and the undesirability of committing our successors to any given
monetary policy strategy. The impossibility stems from the observation that
collective decisions cannot be enforced so that it is impossible to commit to future
collective decisions; the undesirability reflects the fact that we cannot articulate all
possible future states of the world. It is not possible collectively to commit to enforce
a monetary policy contract with an institution such as a central bank. And, even if we
could, we would not want to because that would prevent us from exploiting new
knowledge about the world. In essence, I want to argue that the relevant theoretical
framework could be described as "public goods meet incomplete contracts".
Institutional design is at the heart of collective decisions in a world of incomplete
contracts, and, interestingly, discussion of monetary issues in recent years has
focussed on institutional arrangements.
I shall illustrate the importance of institutional design for the operation of monetary
policy by reference to three case studies: the collapse of exchange rate regimes in
Brazil and the United Kingdom; currency arrangements in Iraq and their reform after
the war last year; and the relationship between central banks and governments when
the zero constraint on nominal interest rates is binding.
Money and monetary policy can be traced back to the dawn of civilisation itself. In
contrast, central banks are a recent development. The first central bank was the
Riksbank in Sweden, set up in 16681. To celebrate its tercentenary it endowed the
Nobel Prize in Economics. The Bank of England, the oldest continuing central bank,

3

opened for business in 1694. Our tercentenary was a more low-key event: we
published a book of conference proceedings. By 1900 there were still only 18
countries with a central bank. Today the number is 174. The Federal Reserve has yet
to reach its centenary. As institutions go, most central banks are youthful. Indeed, the
reputation of central banks as wise and disciplined institutions, in contrast with the
wild excesses of finance ministries, belies their respective ages. So the history of
monetary policy cannot be equated with the history of central banks. But it is a story
about institutions.
I

Externalities in the Theory of Money

In the history of money, the two key events are the emergence of a medium of
exchange and the rise of institutions governing its management. Those events raise
two basic questions which are central to understanding the nature of monetary
institutions. First, why did money evolve as a social or public rather than a private
institution? Second, how can societies reduce the costs of being unable to make
commitments about future collective decisions? The answers to these two questions
determine the nature of modern central banks.
The two questions relate to two different externalities. The first is a network
externality. Money overcomes the constraint of the double coincidence of wants
implied by barter exchange, a view set out in detail by Carl Menger (1892) and which
is modelled explicitly in Nobuhiru Kiyotaki and Randall Wright (1989). More
recently, the existence of money has been linked to the information structure of the
economy. Agents have imperfect information about their potential trading partner’s
credit history which explains the emergence of a private sector medium of exchange
as an alternative to an extension of credit (Narayana Kocherlakota, 1998). Our
willingness to use and hold money is greater the more that money is used by other
people. There is, therefore, a network effect.
One can imagine, and indeed Friedrich Hayek (1976) advocated, a system in which
anyone is allowed to issue money. The private sector may well co-ordinate on using
the money of the ‘best’ issuer, and that issuer’s behaviour may be kept in check by the
threat of entry. But competitive monies have arisen only rarely and in situations where

4

government money is either absent (as, for example, in Robert Radford’s (1945) study
of cigarette money in POW camps) or very badly managed (as in periods of
hyperinflation). Despite the abolition of foreign exchange controls, as recommended
by Hayek, competition among national currencies has not lessened the dominance,
within each economy, of a single public money. Network externalities make it
difficult for competing currencies to emerge.
The existence of public money generates a second type of externality to do with
intertemporal choices. The willingness to hold money as either a store of value or a
means of payment, or use money as a unit in which contracts are denominated,
depends upon expectations of the stability of the value of that money. If money takes
the form of competing private currencies then there is no inherent problem for private
issuers to maintain the value of their liabilities by backing them appropriately, a
commitment that can be enforced by the legal system. Alternatively, where a private
commodity standard is the solution to the exchange problem, then there is no ability and therefore no temptation - to devalue. But a public monopoly means that the
demand for money today depends upon expectations of our collective decisions about
the supply of money tomorrow. The key question for a public currency is how do we
prevent the government - ourselves - abusing its issuing power in the future?
Collective decisions today cannot bind future collective decisions. And when
monetary policy is set period by period inefficient outcomes result. The key insight of
Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott (1977) was that the inability to make
commitments leads to a failure to internalise the impact of public policies on the
expectations of the private sector.
Dynamic inconsistency was used by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Robert Barro
and David Gordon (1983a) to demonstrate that rational expectations could lead to an
equilibrium in which inflation was higher than desired. Ex post it would always seem
attractive to create surprise inflation. More recently, research by Lars Svensson
(1997), Michael Woodford (2003) and others has shown that even when there is no
inflation bias there can be a “stabilisation bias” from the exercise of discretionary
monetary policy: one that would lead to a suboptimal combination of output and
inflation variability. Those results have prompted a large volume of research
exploring different ways in which the commitment to price stability could be made

5

credible. And central banks themselves have devoted no less energy to establishing
the importance of their credibility.
Two very different approaches to the time-consistency problem have been discussed
in the literature. One examines contractual relationships between the public and
monetary decision-makers that reduce or eliminate the degree of inflation and
stabilization biases resulting from discretionary policy. Examples include formal
adoption of monetary policy rules, a contract between government and central bank
instructing the latter to target price stability, the delegation of monetary policy to a
conservative central banker, and investment in a reputation by current decisionmakers. But those answers from the literature on rules versus discretion are not really
solutions. They only move the time-consistency issue one step back – the policy rule
may be abandoned, the central banker fired, the contract reinterpreted or rewritten.2
The other approach says that real central bankers do not and need not worry about
time-inconsistency; they “just do it", (Bennett McCallum, 1995). Central bankers
should simply resist the temptation to deviate from the time-inconsistent policy, and
private agents will eventually come to accept that resolve. Attractive as such a
solution may appear to central bankers, it fails to answer the challenge posed by the
game-theoretic result of Kydland and Prescott. And it fails to explain why it is that
some countries in some periods just do it and others do not. Central bankers who
have the determination and strength of purpose to “take the punch bowl away just
when the party is getting going”, in McChesney Martin's memorable phrase, clearly
have the "right stuff" – so why don’t they “just do it”?3 A deeper explanation of how
this problem can be overcome requires an analysis of what might be called the
“technology of collective decisions”.
Individual agents can make contracts because they believe that the legal system is
external to both parties to the contract. But it is difficult to write contracts that
commit future collective behaviour. Collectively, we can either meet our previous
commitments or we can ignore them. To take just one example: only a few weeks ago
ECOFIN, the council of economic and finance ministers of the European Union,
decided to suspend the excessive deficit procedure – a key feature of the Stability and
Growth Pact - that had been initiated against France and Germany. Ernst Welteke, the

6

President of the Bundesbank, has since raised serious doubts about whether politicians
in Europe are willing to embrace the collective fiscal discipline, backed up by real
sanctions, that is necessary to prevent fiscal free-riding inside a monetary union.4

II

The Role of Institutions

The technology of collective decisions describes the feasible set of institutional
arrangements that can be constructed to reduce the costs of the commitment problem.
That problem may lead to inefficient outcomes – the Coase theorem does not apply to
collective decisions.5 It is useful to think about the optimal design of monetary
institutions using the insights from the theory of incomplete contracts. That theory
discusses what contracts would look like if certain aspects of the world could not be
verified by an outside enforcer of the contract. In terms of monetary policy, there are
two related though distinct aspects of the commitment problem. First, the inability to
enforce commitment, because monetary arrangements can always be changed in the
absence of an outside enforcer, means that no such arrangement is sacrosanct for all
time. Thomas Jefferson believed that the US Constitution should be rewritten every
20 years or so at a new constitutional convention.6 Second, we cannot fully describe
an optimal monetary arrangement because we do not know all possible states of the
world and hence the policy rule to which we would like to commit. Those two
aspects of the technology of collective decisions create a role for institutions.
But they differ in important ways. If there were only a commitment problem, then we
could describe an optimal state-contingent monetary policy reaction function.
Mechanisms could then be devised to make it less likely that policy would deviate
from this optimal plan - perhaps by writing the optimal rule in the form of a
constitutional provision which could be overturned only by a substantial majority, or
financing deficits by issuing index-linked debt. Such mechanisms would make it
incentive compatible collectively to stick to the optimal plan. None of this would
have come as a surprise to the authors of the American Constitution. In Federalist
Paper No.10 James Madison points out that "our governments are too
unstable”(p173) and in No. 37 he writes: "the people of this country, enlightened as
they are with regard to the nature ... of good government, will never be satisfied till

7

some remedy be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterise the
State administrations”(p243). Outside observers agreed. In 1835 Alexis de
Tocqueville wrote that, "the authority which public men possess in America is so brief
and they are so soon commingled with the ever changing population of the country
that the acts of the community frequently leave fewer traces than events in a private
family. .... The instability of administration has penetrated into the habits of the
people".
The stability of institutions is, therefore, one of their greatest assets. Barro and
Gordon (1983b) assumed the existence of an ongoing government or central bank
which had an interest in preserving a reputation for "good" behaviour. A substantial
literature, reviewed by Nancy Stokey (2002), analyses the circumstances in which it is
attractive for a "good" government to distinguish itself from a "bad" government.
Stokey shows that if it is not easy to do so, then it may be optimal to impose a
monetary policy rule on all governments in order to reduce the damage done by the
prospect of a bad government in the future. But how can society convince itself that it
can eliminate bad government by adopting a policy rule? A really bad government
will simply restore discretion to itself. Good and bad governments are not
independent actors. They reflect the degree of consensus on how to construct
institutions that will pursue consistent objectives.
The experience of high and variable inflation itself can be an important force shaping
public attitudes towards the design of institutions to control it. Differences among
cohorts may lead to variations over time in the optimal shape of institutions, rather as
Jefferson advocated. For example, Robert Shiller (1996) reports that 90% of those
born before 1940 in Germany agreed with the statement that ‘The control of inflation
is one of the most important missions of German economic policy’, compared with
51% of those born from 1950 onwards. Memories of hyperinflation can be vivid:
Niall Ferguson cites the diary of one Frankfurt resident in 1923: “it was more than
disorder that smashed over people, it was something like daily explosions… the
smallest, the most private, the most personal events always had one and the same
cause; the raging plunge of money”(p154). So it is not surprising that the generation
of Germans which created the Bundesbank saw it as a crucial component of their new
constitution. Countries, or indeed cohorts, which have not experienced hyper-

8

inflation may be more willing to adopt monetary arrangements that are less
entrenched in constitutional form than the post-war generation in Germany.
The second aspect of the technology of collective decisions that creates a role for
institutions is our ignorance of all possible future states of the world. That means that
even if we were able to commit to a policy rule, we would choose not to do so. The
exercise of some discretion is desirable in order that we may learn. The most cogent
argument against the adoption of a fixed monetary policy rule is that no rule is likely
to remain optimal for long. Nor is this just a question of learning about parameter
values. That would yield an optimal state-contingent procedure for updating the
monetary policy rule. It is that we are unwilling to commit now never to learn from
future experience. So we would not want to embed any rule deeply into our decisionmaking structure, such as giving it the force of law or making it part of the
constitution. Instead, we delegate the power of decision to an institution that will
implement policy period by period exercising “constrained discretion”. The status
and purpose of such institutions can be embedded into the law or constitution, which
may increase the cost of reversing the delegated powers, but the optimal policy path
should be open to change in response to learning. Since we cannot hope to describe
ex ante what it is we expect to learn, and since new ideas are unlikely to be uniformly
recognised and instantly accepted, it may be sensible to delegate both the immediate
policy decision and the process of learning to the same institution.7
An interesting example of seeking flexibility to allow for learning occurred during the
writing of the US constitution. One draft clause specified that Congress should be
allowed to “…emit bills on the credit of the United States”. There was a debate on a
proposition to strike out the clause. Madison’s notes describe George Mason’s
position on the subject: “Though he had a mortal hatred to paper money, yet, as he
could not foresee all emergencies, he was unwilling to tie the hands of the
legislature”8. Edmund Randolph was of a similar opinion: “… notwithstanding his
antipathy to paper money, [he] could not agree to strike out the words, as he could not
foresee all the occasions that might arise.”
So the ideal is a framework that will implement what we currently believe to be the
optimal monetary policy strategy and will deviate from that only if collectively we

9

change our view about what that strategy should be. Our ignorance is too pervasive to
allow the adoption of a rule for how learning should occur. So if it is sensible to
delegate both policy decisions and the process of learning to institutions such as
central banks, that in turn requires those institutions to have political legitimacy and
an acceptance that they will not redistribute income and wealth in favour of some
groups rather than others at the expense of the objective given to them.9 Where such
institutions are difficult to create, the ‘external effect’ - as Stokey (2002) called it - of
good monetary policy will not be captured. And if the result is a monetary policy that
is sufficiently bad, it may result in a radical switch to a unit of account determined
externally, an obvious example of which is dollarisation.
Monetary institutions, therefore, play two different roles. First, they expand the
possibility frontier of the technology of collective decisions and can be designed to
raise the cost of those decisions deviating from pre-announced contingent paths.
Second, they are set up explicitly to exercise a degree of discretion – “constrained
discretion” – subject to the broad objective of price stability. Discretion is inevitable
because of the need to learn about the economic environment. Institutions thereby
become repositories of experience and knowledge which they communicate to society
as a whole.

Case Study I: Exchange Rate Regimes in Brazil and the UK

I want to illustrate the importance of institutions and the credibility of their stability
by three case studies. My first example concerns the collapse of exchange rate
regimes in Europe and Latin America. It demonstrates that economic institutions
require a broad base of political support if financial markets are to believe that those
institutions are likely to survive.
For a while fixed exchange rate regimes enjoyed a degree of support in both Europe,
with the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), and Latin America. But experience
shows that, in terms of credibility in financial markets, the design of those policy
regimes was less important than the fact of their having broad political support.

10

Brazil in 1998-99 is a case in point. In 1998 Brazil operated a crawling peg exchange
rate regime. As can be seen from Chart 1, throughout that year markets expected the
Real to depreciate as evidenced by the fact that the implied forward exchange rate was
lower than the spot rate by more than the crawl would imply.10 In order to defend the
crawling peg, the central bank raised interest rates in September 1998 from 20% to
40% a year. The implied forward exchange rate promptly fell. Raising interest rates
actually increased the expectation that the peg would be abandoned, since markets
knew that high interest rates were likely to prove politically unsustainable. Any
government prepared to keep interest rates that high was not likely to win re-election.
In January 1999 a second speculative attack on the peg occurred. And this time the
peg was abandoned. Although short-term interest rates were raised while the peg was
being defended, they were soon lowered to more sustainable levels. The expectations
that had been built into forward exchange rates were proved correct.
[insert chart 1 here]
In the literature on target zones for exchange rates, it is assumed that raising interest
rates is a successful method for supporting the exchange rate because of uncovered
interest parity. But this ignores the possibility that raising interest rates to defend a
fixed exchange-rate regime will simply call into question the durability of the regime
itself and raise the probability that the peg or target zone will be abandoned. In such
circumstances an increase in interest rates may lead to a fall in the exchange rate.
A second example of the same phenomenon is the pressure on sterling during 1992
and its forced departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on 16 September of that
year. Massive speculation on that day led to the announcement in the morning of a 2
percentage points rise in interest rates and, when that failed to dampen the pressure on
sterling, of a further 3 percentage points rise in rates. That second announcement, far
from bolstering the exchange rate, merely convinced financial markets that Britain's
membership of the ERM could no longer be sustained politically. The strong political
commitment to joining European monetary union, which was the effective support for
other currencies in the ERM, was absent in the United Kingdom.

11

Following its departure from the ERM, the UK introduced an inflation target regime
for monetary policy. It succeeded in bringing inflation down to around 2 1/2 percent
(see chart 2).
[insert chart 2 here]
But long-term inflation expectations did not fall as quickly. Only after the
announcement in May 1997 by the new Labour government that the Bank of England
would be made independent did inflation expectations fall quickly to the target level,
as can be seen from chart 2. That reform created an expectation that it would be in the
interests of all political parties not to repeal the legislation. For the first time since the
Second World War, there was a broad-based and credible commitment in the UK to
stable and low inflation.
The need for any monetary regime to command sufficient support in order to acquire
a reasonable life-expectancy was given insufficient weight in the discussions that took
place at the IMF and elsewhere on Brazil and other financial crises of the 1990s. The
point is made by Guillermo Calvo and Frederic Mishkin (2003) when they write, "the
key to macroeconomic success in emerging market countries is not primarily their
choice of exchange rate regime, but rather the health of the countries’ fundamental
macroeconomic institutions, ... less attention should be focused on the general
question whether a floating or a fixed exchange rate is preferable, and more on these
deeper institutional arrangements"(p5).11
IV

Case Study 2: Currency Reform In Iraq

The importance of expectations about the future of monetary institutions is illustrated
by the recent monetary history of Iraq. This second case study demonstrates that
expectations of future collective decisions can have a major impact on the value of a
currency quite independently of the policies pursued by the current government.
Expectations of monetary decisions within a given policy regime may be less
significant than expectations of changes in the regime itself. In Iraq, regime change
took on a new meaning. What is particularly interesting about Iraq is the link between
expectations of a change in political regime and movements in currency values.

12

Prior to the Gulf War in 1991 the Iraqi currency was the dinar. Following that war
Iraq was divided into two parts that were politically, militarily and economically
separate from each other: southern Iraq was under the control of Saddam Hussein and
the enforcement of the northern no-fly-zone meant that northern Iraq became a de
facto Kurdish protectorate. In the South, Saddam’s regime struggled to cope with UN
sanctions, and resorted to printing money to finance growing fiscal deficits. Unable to
import notes printed abroad because of sanctions, the regime printed low-quality notes
in Iraq that bore Saddam’s image. In May 1993, the Central Bank of Iraq announced
that the 25 dinar note, then the highest denomination note in circulation, would be
withdrawn and replaced by a new locally printed note. These were known as
‘Saddam’ or ‘print’ (because of the offset litho print technology used) dinars.
Citizens had three weeks to exchange old for new notes. So many notes were printed
that the face value of cash in circulation jumped from 22 billion dinars at the end of
1991 to 584 billion only four years later. Inflation soared to an average of about
250% a year over the same period. As a result the smaller denomination notes
became worthless in Southern Iraq.
In the North, however, matters were rather different. Residents in that part of Iraq had
no opportunity to exchange their notes. And it was no accident that, because of
expropriation of cash in the banks by the Saddam regime, the holders of the high
denomination notes were disproportionately in the North. Of the seven billion 25
dinar notes in circulation in Iraq at that time, about five billion circulated in Kurdishcontrolled Iraq. So the Saddam dinar did not circulate in the North, and the old dinar
notes continued to be used. They were known as the ‘Swiss’ dinar – so- called
because although the notes had been printed by the British company De La Rue, the
plates had been manufactured in Switzerland. The Swiss dinar developed a life of its
own and in effect became the new currency in the North. No Swiss dinar notes were
issued after 1989, and since there was no issuing authority there was at most a fixed,
and probably a declining money stock in the North. As a result the Swiss and Saddam
dinars developed into two separate currencies.
For ten years, therefore, Iraq had two currencies: one issued by the official
government and the other backed by no government at all. The Swiss dinar continued

13

to circulate in the North, even though backed by no formal government, central bank,
nor any law of legal tender. For a fiat currency this was an unusual situation.
Whatever gave the Swiss dinar its value was not the promise of the official Iraqi
government, or indeed any other government.12
Although there was little or no trade between North and South Iraq, both the Swiss
and Saddam dinars were traded against the dollar. The implied Swiss to Saddam
dinar cross-exchange rate from 1997 onwards is shown in Chart 3.13
[Chart 3 here]
After 1993 the Swiss dinar deviated from parity and rose to around 300 Saddam
dinars to the Swiss dinar by the time Saddam’s regime was deposed in 2003. The
appreciation of the Swiss dinar is clearly a consequence of the evolution of the actual
and expected money supplies in the two territories.
Given the monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the Saddam regime, the rise of the
Swiss dinar against the Saddam dinar is, perhaps, understandable. But what is less
obvious is the path of the Swiss dinar against the US dollar. Chart 4 shows the Swiss
dinar-dollar exchange rate from 1997 onwards.
[insert Chart 4 here]
After fluctuating in the early 1990s, the Swiss dinar rose sharply against the US dollar
from the middle of 2002 as the prospect of an end to the Saddam regime increased. It
rose from around 18 to the dollar in May 2002 to about 6 to the dollar by the
beginning of May 2003 when the war ended. That appreciation reflected expectations
about (i) the durability of the political and military separation of Kurdish from
Saddam-controlled Iraq and (ii) the likelihood that a new institution would be
established governing monetary policy in Iraq as a whole that would retrospectively
back the value of the Swiss dinar. The political complexion of Northern Iraq led to
the assumption that the currency used there would have value once regime change had
occurred.

14

In other words, the value of the Swiss dinar had everything to do with politics and
nothing to do with the economic policies of the government issuing the Swiss dinar
because no such government existed. As someone might have said, “it’s the political
economy, stupid!”
Another illustration of this is shown in Chart 5 which plots the Swiss dinar/dollar
exchange rate against the values of futures contracts showing how expectations about
the political order in Iraq were evolving.
[Insert Chart 5 here]
One futures contract paid out 100 cents if Saddam was deposed by the end of June
2003 and nothing otherwise. As the chance of Saddam's regime being deposed (and
the price of the future) rose, the Swiss dinar appreciated against the dollar. Later there
was also a future that paid 100 cents if Saddam was captured by the end of December
2003, and nothing otherwise. As the chance of this happening (and the price of the
future) fell last autumn, the Swiss dinar fell against the dollar. It has just risen again.
Again, expectations about the future political order in Iraq, which have repercussions
for the likely monetary regime in northern Iraq, influence the value of the Swiss dinar
today.
Much of this was understood by Kurds in the North where the exchange rate of the
Swiss dinar to the dollar was a matter of both concern and interest. The minutes of a
meeting of the Kurdish Regional Government on 14 October 2002 state: “KRG Prime
Minister Nechirvan Barzani chaired a meeting to discuss the ongoing problem of the
weak US dollar in the local currency markets. Discussion focussed on the …
unprecedented 45% decrease in the value of the US dollar against the Iraqi Swiss
dinar, possible causes of the problem, and effects on the market”. Realising that the
effect of a change in the exchange rate cannot be understood without an analysis of
the causes of the change, the minutes continue, in a manner that would do justice to
the minutes of any G7 central bank, “It was pointed out that the US dollar is currently
stable in foreign markets so there must be other explanations for the sharp slide in
value in Iraqi Kurdistan”.14 In other words, an explanation was needed for a rise in
the real value of the Swiss dinar.

15

Of course, as we now know, the expectation that a future institution guaranteeing the
integrity of the Kurdish area, and of the value of their currency, turned out to be
correct. Coalition forces assumed control of the whole territory, and on 7 July 2003
the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, Paul Bremer, announced that a new
Iraqi dinar would be printed and exchanged for the two existing currencies at a rate
that implied that one Swiss dinar was worth 150 Saddam dinars. The exchange was to
take place over the period 15 October to 15 January. It is now virtually complete.
The new dinars, like the Swiss, were printed by De la Rue in a very short space of
time using plants in Britain and several other countries, and were flown into Iraq on
22 flights using Boeing 747 and other aeroplanes. The fact that the populations of
both North and South Iraq have been prepared to exchange their old notes for new
dinars reflects the confidence which they have in the future of the institutions backing
the new Iraqi dinar.
The 150 parity is barely half the rate the Swiss dinar reached at its peak (see Chart 6).
[insert Chart 6 here]
But it is above the average rate that prevailed over the past six years, and above the
rate that would equalise the purchasing power of the two currencies. For example,
around the time when the new conversion rate was being determined, it was estimated
that 128 Saddam dinars to the Swiss would equalise the wages of an engineer in the
two parts of Iraq, 100 would equate the price of the shoes he wore to work, and 133
the price of his suit.15
From Chart 6, it is clear that the exchange rate hovered above 150 after the parity was
announced on 7 July. There are two reasons for this. First, the 10,000 Saddam dinar
note was heavily counterfeited, easy to do given the primitive local technology used
to print them. The exchange rate of this note against the dollar is consistently less
than the 250 dinar note which, as a smaller denomination note, was less heavily
counterfeited. The Swiss notes, printed using more sophisticated technology, are
virtually free of counterfeits. The Swiss notes traded at above the parity because of
the risk that holders of the 10,000 note would find that they had a forgery and could

16

not exchange it at the central bank. Second, before the capture of Saddam Hussein
there was inevitably some uncertainty about the prospects of the new regime and the
new currency that it issued.
The circulation of Swiss dinars in Kurdish controlled Iraq during the 1990s was a
market solution to the problem of devising a medium of exchange in the absence of a
government with the power to issue currency. Changes in the relative price of Swiss
and Saddam dinars show that the value of money depends on beliefs about the
probability of survival of the institutions that define the state itself.
V

Case Study 3: Monetary Policy in Japan and the Zero Bound on Interest

Rates
My third case study shows that institutional arrangements need to be consonant with
the underlying economics, or failure will result. Recent experience in Japan has led to
the rebirth of interest in monetary policy when official interest rates are constrained
by the zero lower bound. Official short-term interest rates in Japan have been
approximately zero since the beginning of 1999. Of particular interest in this context
is the question of how responsibilities should be divided between the central bank, on
the one hand, and the finance ministry, on the other.
Guy Debelle and Stanley Fischer (1994) introduced the distinction between
instrument and goal independence of central banks. That distinction has become the
standard framework within which to analyse the optimal constitution of central banks.
But such a distinction presumes the existence of a policy instrument that is uniquely
available to the central bank. That instrument is the level of official short-term
interest rates. But when interest rates are constrained at their lower bound of zero, the
position is much less clear. Indeed, I shall argue that in such circumstances both
instrument and goal independence are impossible. Rather when interest rates are at
their zero lower bound, policy relies on successful cooperation between central bank
and finance ministry.
I shall assume that, when interest rates are zero, monetary policy takes the form of
open market purchases or sales of government securities using central bank money.

17

A well-known policy prescription, which has become known as unconventional
monetary policy, is that the central bank should buy long-term Government bonds
rather than the more conventional short-term bills. The Bank of Japan did indeed
follow this prescription. The logic of such a proposal is as follows. Long-term bonds
are likely to contain a significant premium to compensate investors for their lack of
liquidity – the fact that, in practice, investors face significant costs when switching
between bonds and goods. When the central bank offers to buy illiquid long-term
bonds, it increases the average liquidity of the private sector’s portfolio, replacing less
liquid with more liquid securities. The private sector will therefore be more willing to
hold other illiquid instruments, such as private sector bonds and equities. As a result,
liquidity premia fall across a broad category of securities, raising their market value.
That will stimulate spending by firms and consumers.16 Such a policy is preferable to
conventional open market purchases of short-term bills or bonds because when
interest rates are zero such bills become perfect substitutes for cash. Hence purchases
of short bonds have no effect on spending or other real variables.
It is a short step to show that this argument implies an equivalence proposition
between unconventional quantitative operations, on the one hand, and a combination
of neutral conventional operations and government debt management, on the other.
The purchase of a long-term bond by the central bank is equivalent to a combination
of two other operations: a purchase of a short-term bill, followed by an operation that
swaps the short-term bill for the long term bond. In either case, the central bank
balance sheet ends up with an additional liability in cash, and an additional asset in
long-term bonds. The first of these two operations, the purchase of a short-term bill,
is neutral in its effect as it replaces one private sector asset, a short-term bill, with
another, cash, that is a perfect substitute for it. The second is debt management,
which is normally seen as the responsibility of the finance ministry. So when interest
rates are zero unconventional quantitative operations and debt management are
indistinguishable.
The interplay between monetary policy and debt management may not matter too
much when short-term interest rates are positive because the central bank can control
the level of interest rates, even if debt management affects the optimal level of rates.
But when rates are at their zero bound then the central bank no longer has instrument

18

independence. Indeed, because its actions can be offset by appropriate sales or
purchases in the government debt market, it loses goal independence too. It becomes
crucial that fiscal and monetary authorities cooperate. An alternative strategy,
equivalent in terms of its monetary effects but avoiding the risk to the Bank of Japan’s
balance sheet from holding large quantities of government bonds, would have been
for the Ministry of Finance to have issued short-term bills to the BoJ, using the
proceeds to purchase and retire long-term government bonds. Similar arguments
apply to other unconventional monetary policies, such as purchases of foreign
currency, which conflict with the responsibilities of the fiscal authorities for the
ownership of foreign exchange reserves.
A serious problem for the Japanese authorities was that the Bank of Japan was granted
independence not long before it became necessary for policy to be coordinated
between MoF and the BoJ.17 Inevitably, the desire on both sides to respect the newlywon independence of the central bank came into conflict with the growing realisation
that monetary policy was operating in a zero-interest rate environment. The clarity of
communication about the objectives of monetary policy diminishes when it is no
longer possible to identify clear and distinct responsibilities for the two institutions.
A desirable long-term reform – central bank independence - led to short-term
difficulties.

Conclusions

I am conscious that I have raised more questions than I have answered - perhaps that
is what happens when you become a central banker. I hope I have not copied my
room-mate at Harvard whose PhD supervisor wrote, "he chewed more than he had
bitten off".18 But the search for institutions that improve our ability to handle the two
problems associated with public money - the impossibility and undesirability of
committing our successors - is never ending, and our knowledge is limited. At the
very first gathering of economists to create the American Economic Association, in
Saratoga in September 1885, Richard Ely showed that he had the makings of a good
central banker when he said, “We acknowledge our ignorance, and if we claim
superiority to others it is largely on the very humble ground that we know better what

19

we do not know”. Or, in Hayek’s words, “It is high time we took our ignorance more
seriously”.
The inability to bind future generations means that institutions do not resemble an
optimal time-invariant design chosen from behind the “veil of ignorance”. They
reflect, in Hayek’s words, “how nations in the darkness stumble upon institutions
which are in fact the result of human actions, not the implementation of a human
plan”.19
Suitably designed, though, monetary institutions can help to reduce the inefficiencies
resulting from the time-consistency problem and can incorporate new ideas into a
discretionary monetary strategy constrained by a mandate that has widespread support
in the population as a whole. A central bank needs to explain to the population both
what it knows and what it does not know. Such a framework of “constrained
discretion” for central banks is far-removed from the world of 1930 when the Deputy
Governor of the Bank of England explained to the Macmillan Committee that "it is a
dangerous thing to start to give reasons".
In 1908 Congress set up the National Monetary Commission to report on "what
changes are necessary or desirable in the monetary system of United States". Before
recommending the establishment of the Federal Reserve System - a plan which it
described as "essentially an American system, scientific in its methods, and
democratic in its control" – the Commission produced 22 volumes on the monetary
and banking systems elsewhere, especially in Europe. Copies of these volumes sit
proudly in the Governor’s anteroom in the Bank of England. The authors noted that
"the important place which the Bank of England holds in the financial world is due to
the wisdom of the men who have controlled its operations and not to any legislative
enactments". But they did not see the Bank of England as a model, and they
recommended the creation of an institution framed by legislation. It would be ninety
years before Britain finally learnt the lessons of the National Monetary Commission
and passed legislation to buttress whatever wisdom the Bank could command.
Institutions embody accumulated wisdom and experience, and they should not be
meddled with lightly. From time to time, however, it is necessary to rethink the role

20

of our institutions. The changes made to the Bank of England in recent years,
including an inflation target and a high degree of transparency, have, I believe,
improved Britain's monetary arrangements. Whether either the men and women or
the current institutional arrangements of the Bank of England will have any more
success in influencing monetary arrangements in the United States today than in 1908
is a matter I leave to you.

NOTES
∗

Governor, Bank of England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R8AH. I am deeply grateful to James
Proudman, Jan Vlieghe and Tony Yates for their research collaboration and for many of the ideas in
this lecture. They are truly co-authors. I am also grateful to Peter Andrews, Andrew Bailey, John
Campbell, Forest Capie, Philip Evans, Niall Ferguson, Charles Goodhart, Simon Gray, Oliver Hart,
John Moore, Tom Sargent, Lars Svensson, Greg Thwaites and Geoffrey Wood for their helpful
comments. Kath Begley and Ed Bolingbrooke provided valuable research assistance. All errors and
omissions are my responsibility.
1

Strictly speaking, it is not clear that the Riksbank was what we would today recognise to be a central
bank until considerably later.
2

Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini (1999) argue that if it takes sufficient time for a government to
tear up contracts designed to eliminate the inflation bias (longer than the duration of nominal contracts)
promises not to inflate can be credible.
3

Svensson (2002) takes the same view of McCallum (1995) in his comments on Stokey (2002), thus:
“…to my knowledge neither McCallum nor anyone else has presented a model where ‘just do it’ is an
equilibrium outcome.”[p4].
4

“The institutional structure of monetary union forms the basis for public trust in the euro and rests on
two pillars: the stability-oriented monetary constitution enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, and the
stability and growth pact. Both pillars are being undermined, leaving European monetary union in a
very grave predicament”. (Ernst Welteke, The Times, 4 December 2003).
5

Daron Acemoglu (2003) argues that inefficient policies can occur in a democracy because those in
political power cannot commit to maintaining the policies that are required to achieve efficient
outcomes. In other words, the Coase theorem does not apply at the level of society as a whole.

6

As reported by Gore Vidal (2003).

7

Svensson (2003) takes a view that is related to the argument here. In his opinion, commitment to
‘targeting rules’ – objectives that the central bank must pursue – are workable, while commitment to
‘instrument rules’ – reaction functions – are not, since it is “impossible” that “every conceivable
contingency be anticipated” [p439].
8

This is cited in David Dewey (1918), page 68.

9

The costs and benefits of discretion in a world where we cannot describe future possible states of the
world are set out in Philippe Aghion and Patrick Bolton (2002).
10

The forward rate was below the spot rate even allowing for the devaluation implied by the crawling
peg.

their paper. At the time of writing, the Journal of Economic Perspectives version, which appears in the
list of references, was still forthcoming.

At no stage did the Kurdish groups lay claim to the Swiss dinar as their currency – they had no
control over it – as shown by the interview given to Gulf News on 30 January 2003 by the Kurdistan
Regional Government Prime Minister Barzani who said, “We don’t have our own currency”.

How large are these effects is an open question. The absence of a compelling general equilibrium
theory of liquidity makes it difficult to produce reliable empirical estimates. For the purposes of the
equivalence proposition the magnitude of the effect is irrelevant.

17

The legislation was published in 1997, and took effect in April 1998.

The supervisor (in English literature) was citing a letter from Mrs Henry Adams to her father,
December 1881: "Its not that he bites off more than he can chaw as T.G. Appleton said of Nathan, but
he chaws more than he bites off." (Nathan was Appleton’s son). The remark is also sometimes
attributed to Mark Twain as a comment on Henry James’ writing.
