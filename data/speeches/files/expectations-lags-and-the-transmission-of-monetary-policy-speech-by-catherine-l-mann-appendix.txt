Expectations, lags, and the transmission of monetary policy - speech by
Catherine L. Mann given at the Resolution Foundation, 23 February 2023.

A1. Structural decomposition of the Sterling-Dollar exchange rate

The underlying setup is based on Brandt et al. (2021) who model the role of monetary
policy spillovers and global risk for US and euro area financial market variables. We then
adapt and extend the model for the UK.
It is a Bayesian VAR in daily frequency identified using sign restrictions (following Arias et
al., 2018) and comprising financial variables in both the UK and US. The model is tightly
restricted according to theoretical predictions about the direction of changes in variables
following a given shock.
Within the same country, monetary policy shocks and macroeconomic shocks are
disentangled by the co-movement of yields and equity prices. Ceteris paribus, monetary
policy should induce a negative correlation between the two, while macroeconomic news
induce a positive correlation.
Across countries, shocks are identified by magnitude restrictions on the relative size of the
effect on yields, on impact. That is, a UK-domestic shock has a larger effect on UK yields
(but may still affect US yields to some extent). Vice versa, a US shock is assumed to affect
US yields more than UK yields.
Finally, there are two types of risk shocks in the model which are designed to reflect
changes in both risk preferences and risk perceptions by global investors. Firstly, a global
risk shock which captures risk-on/risk-off movements common to both countries and
causes re-allocation between asset classes. It is identified as a shock which increases the
attractiveness of riskless to risky assets (i.e. bond prices up, stock prices down), and leads
to safe-haven flows into Dollar-denominated assets. Thus, a global risk-off shock
decreases both UK and US yields (but US yields by more) and causes a depreciation of
Sterling. In addition, there is a UK-specific risk shock which captures flows into or out of
Sterling-denominated assets regardless of their relative riskiness. Therefore, it also causes
a depreciation but, crucially, and in contrast to the global shock, it causes an increase in
UK yields. This is because even less risky Sterling assets such as government bonds lose
attractiveness.

A2. A UK financial conditions index

We construct another financial conditions index (FCI) for the UK using principal component
analysis, inspired by Angelopoulou et al. (2013). The index uses monthly data on a range
of short and long term nominal government bond yields, term spreads (the difference
between some short and long term yields and Bank Rate), credit spreads and risky asset
prices. This index should be seen as a complement to the Bank’s Monetary and Financial
Conditions Index which uses multipliers similar in principle to those used in the MPC
forecast to construct its weights.1
In common with a lot of macroeconomic variables, some financial market variables also
suffer from issues of non-stationarity which induces non-stationarity also within the FCI. To
alleviate concerns about stationarity, interest rate variables in the index are de-trended
using an estimate of the long run real interest rate2, and other variables such as equity
prices are stationarised using log differences.
All variables are standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing by their standard
deviation. This is to avoid differences in magnitude or units of the variables unduly
influencing the index. It therefore provides a relative, not an absolute measure of financial
conditions. An increase in the index denotes a tightening in financial conditions, and a
decrease a loosening in financial conditions but it is unclear to what extent they are tight or
loose in absolute terms. In other words, financial conditions above 0 are tight conditions
relative only to the average index value.
Variables are also normalised to account for the way in which the series affect financial
conditions. In order for an increase in the FCI to denote a tightening in financial conditions,
variables where an increase reflects a loosening in financial conditions enter the model
with an inverted sign. Finally, the index is compiled using weights implied by the first three
principal components (which explain almost 80% of the overall variation in the data) on the
normalised variables.

A3. Updated estimates of the effect of UK monetary policy

We build upon the specification of Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2020) by extending the sample until
the end of 2019 and re-estimating both reduced and structural form using updated data.
We find that the results in the paper are robust to the inclusion of additional data and an
alternative proxy.
Chart A3.1 shows the full set of impulse response functions for the specification shown in
Chart 7 of the speech. To note, the results presented here are for a 25 basis point
contractionary monetary policy shock (as in Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2020). There is a
significant effect on financial and credit variables, such as corporate bond and mortgage
spreads, but also on US corporate spreads. This is in line with the literature (such as
Gerko and Rey, 2017 and Gertler and Karadi, 2015) which highlights the importance of the
financial channel in the transmission of monetary policy.

– full specification, as in Chart 7 of the speech

We run a series of additional robustness checks on these results. First, we use a different
proxy for the monetary policy shock. Cesa-Bianchi et al. create “a monetary policy
surprises series from intra-day data that captures changes in expectations about the
monetary policy stance in the UK for every monetary policy ‘event’ since 1997”. Changes
in expectations about monetary policy stance are calculated using the intraday change in

interest rate futures at various different maturities. We verify whether the model
specification is robust to using a different instrument: we use shocks derived from using
intraday interest rate changes around monetary policy announcements, to capture the
unexpected component of monetary policy. The methodology extracts principal
components from the high-frequency surprises, and rotates these for economic
interpretation.
As suggested by Bauer and Swanson (2022), we clean these shocks for between-meeting
surprises in macroeconomic data. Chart A3.2 shows the results of this robustness check,
where the impulse response functions are of the same specification as in Chart A3.1, but
using the alternative proxy. We find that the responses to a 25 basis point shock are larger
in the macroeconomic variables: CPI, unemployment and GDP, but also in some financial
variables, the spreads and the exchange rate. The impact on variables also peaks sooner.

– full specification, with a different instrument

For further robustness checks, we also include a measure of financial conditions (detailed
in section A2) as a control variable in the model. We keep all other financial variables from
the original specification in the model, as the FCI gives little weight to spreads, and does
not include international financial variables. Chart A3.3 shows that the reaction, and peak,
occurs early in £ERI and financial conditions, though magnitudes on the movement in
financial conditions are implausible. CPI falls and unemployment rises, though both are
insignificant.

A4. Simple New Keynesian model with backward-looking price-setters
At its core, the model is the simple New Keynesian model described in Chapter 3 of
Galí (2015) with the following three equations with all variables in logarithms:
1. Dynamic IS curve:
∗ ]
𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ = 𝐸[𝑦𝑡+1 − 𝑦𝑡+1
−

1
(𝑖 − 𝐸[𝜋𝑡+1 ] − 𝑟𝑡∗ )
𝜎 𝑡

It defines today’s output gap as a function of the expected output gap tomorrow and
the distance of the current real interest rate 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑖𝑡 − 𝐸[𝜋𝑡+1 ] from its neutral rate.
The neutral rate is determined by the technology used in production as well as
consumer preferences for consumption and saving.
2. Phillips curve with naïve expectations formation:
𝜋𝑡 = 𝛾𝑛 𝜋̂𝑡+1 + 𝛾𝑓 𝐸[𝜋𝑡+1 ] + 𝜆(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ ) + 𝑢𝑡
Here, we extend the standard New Keynesian Phillips curve by including naïve
price-setters along the argument of section 4.1 in Galí and Gertler (1999). We begin
with a standard Calvo-pricing setup in which firms are able to adjust their price 𝑝
with probability (1 − 𝜃). Accordingly, today’s price level is a weighted average of
yesterday’s price level and the firms’ index of desired reset prices 𝑝∗ :
𝑝𝑡 = 𝜃𝑝𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝜃)𝑝𝑡∗
In the standard New Keynesian setup, this desired reset price is simply a weighted
average of discounted future marginal costs. With a discount factor 𝛽, it is:
∞
𝑓
𝑝𝑡

= (1 − 𝛽𝜃) ∑(𝛽𝜃)𝑘 𝐸𝑡 [𝜇 + mc𝑡 ]
𝑘=0

Here, we assume, however, that there exists a second type of firm which
determines its desired reset price according to some naïve rule of thumb. Assume
that the share of naïve firms is a constant 𝜔, then the index of optimal reset prices
is a weighted average of desired prices of those firms and the fundamental, rational
expectations-implied price:
𝑓

𝑝𝑡∗ = 𝜔𝑝𝑡𝑛 + (1 − 𝜔)𝑝𝑡

In the following we impose that these naïve firms just extrapolate last period’s
inflation rate (i.e. 𝜋̂𝑡 = 𝜋𝑡−1 ) but the model is general enough to capture more

Page 9

sophisticated ways of expectations formation. The optimal reset price of the naïve
firm is therefore:
∗
𝑝𝑡𝑛 = 𝑝𝑡−1
+ 𝜋𝑡−1

We then assume that there exists a linear mapping between real marginal costs
and the output gap. Finally, 𝑢 is a persistent cost-push shock which increases
mark-ups over and above price inflation implied by demand conditions.
This gives rise to the above Phillips curve with weights that are non-linear functions
of the share of naïve firms, discount factors, and the degree of price-stickiness. We
obtain:
𝛾𝑛 =

𝜔
𝛽𝜃
, 𝛾𝑓 =
𝜃 + 𝜔[1 − 𝜃(1 − 𝛽)]
𝜃 + 𝜔[1 − 𝜃(1 − 𝛽)]

3. Contemporaneous Taylor rule
𝑖𝑡 = 𝜙𝜋 𝜋𝑡 + 𝜙𝑦 (𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ ) + 𝜈𝑡
Finally, we assume the central bank sets policy according to a simple
contemporaneous policy rule with fixed parameters which trades-off inflation and
the output gap subject to a monetary policy shock 𝜈. For the balanced policy rule,
we choose 𝜙𝜋 = 1.5 and 𝜙𝑦 = 0.5 while in the inflation-biased rule, these
parameters are 1.8 and 0.2 respectively.

Depending on the share of naïve, backward-looking firms, shocks lead to more persistent
deviations of inflation from target. See Chart A4.1 for the response to a persistent
cost-push shock and Chart A4.2 for the response to a monetary policy shock. In both
charts, the shock is normalised to yield an increase in the nominal interest rate of 100
basis points under the fully forward-looking baseline.
Charts A4.3 and A4.4 explore the gains from an inflation-biased policy rule given varying
degrees of backward-looking expectations formation. In order to summarise the trade-off
under the two rules, we specify a discounted squared-error loss function following Carney
(2017):

∗ )2 ]
Loss = ∑ 𝛽 ℎ [(𝜋𝑡+ℎ − 𝜋 ∗ )2 + 𝜆(𝑦𝑡+ℎ − 𝑦𝑡+ℎ
2

ℎ=1

We find that the inflation-biased Taylor rule delivers a lower aggregate loss for a wide
range of choices of 𝜆 with disproportionately higher gains at higher degrees of
backward-lookingness. For example, when we evaluate the above function for 𝛽 = 0.99
and 𝜆 = 0.5, we obtain the following values:
𝜔=0

𝜔 = 0.4

𝜔 = 0.8

So, while the gains from putting a high weight on inflation in the policy rule are small in
cases in which backward-lookingness is modest, there are large gains when there are
many backward-looking agents.
Note, however, that these are all cases in which 𝜔 is exogenously chosen. Therefore, we
conclude that in a world in which 𝜔 actually depends on realised inflation deviations from
target (and therefore on the chosen policy path), there is value in insuring against bad
outcomes by adopting an inflation-biased rule even before 𝜔 is known to the policymaker
(or is unknown altogether).
