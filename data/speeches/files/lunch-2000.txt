Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It seems only a very short time ago that I last had the pleasure of visiting Northern Ireland - in fact it was in
May 1998. Time flies when the world about us is changing fast as it certainly has been in so many respects
in the intervening period.

Let me start with the world economy. We were already then in the grip of the financial shock that had started
in emerging markets in Asia in 1997. But that shock intensified through 1998 - spreading to Russia and parts
of Latin America and elsewhere - and at one point, following the collapse of the US hedge fund LTCM,
threatening to engulf the financial system of the industrial world.

The economic consequence of this financial turmoil was a sharp slowdown in the world economy to around
half its longer-term trend rate of growth. It could have been far worse. The slowdown could have turned into
an actual downturn had the industrial countries - led by the United States, and the United Kingdom and
closely followed by the Eurozone and Japan - not succeeded in stimulating their own, domestic, demand. In
the event, the damage was contained, and world economic activity is now recovering far more quickly than
anyone could have expected. But, encouraging though it is, the recovery is taking place in a context of large
external imbalances within the world economy and large imbalances between strong domestic and weak
external demand in a number of industrial countries - most notably in the US and here in the UK. The
challenge now for the major industrial countries - as we discussed at the G7 meeting last weekend in Tokyo is to secure a more balanced pattern of growth among our economies in order to help sustain the global
expansion.

This chain of international events has also had a major impact on the pattern of exchange rates. Many
emerging countries and some transition economies saw their exchange rates fall dramatically; but there were
also important effects on the relationships between the currencies of the major industrial countries. The
dollar and sterling have in fact remained reasonably stable against each other for most of the time since
sterling withdrew from the ERM. The Yen, which had been notably weak on the Japanese recession has
since picked up strongly as the prospect of recovery in Japan improved. But the most puzzling development
in the exchange markets has been the disappointing weakening of the euro since its historic introduction at
the beginning of last year. Initially this appeared to be related to the impact of the global slowdown on some
of the larger Eurozone economies, which seemed likely to cause them to run further below capacity than had
earlier been expected. But the more recent signs are that the Eurozone economy is now picking up relatively
strongly, and it is harder to understand the euro's continuing weakness in the present context: it may just be
a matter of time - for there is no doubt that the euro has considerable scope for appreciation.

Taken together, Mr President, these various international developments since I was last here in Belfast have
greatly complicated the task of monetary management here in the UK - in fact it has been just about the most
difficult external environment that I can recall.

At that time monetary policy was still aimed at moderating the pace of domestic demand growth to prevent
the re-emergence of inflationary pressure - including wage pressures in the labour market. We actually
raised rates by ¼% to 7½% shortly after my visit - but I promise you that was not a direct result of my visit
here.

But we reversed engines fairly aggressively when evidence of the effect of global slowdown on our own
economy began to appear in the autumn - cutting interest rates from 7½% to 5% between October 1998 and
last summer. You might have supposed that this would have weakened the exchange rate, shielding us in
some degree from weakening external demand growth - but not a bit of it - the exchange rate actually
strengthened! But the easing of monetary policy may have helped to reverse the sharp fall in domestic
confidence evident throughout the UK economy in the second half of 1998, and to avert the widely predicted
slide into recession. In any event, after coming to a virtual stand-still in the fourth quarter of 1998, the
economy as a whole bounced back last year, driven largely by domestic demand growth. And, for the
economy as a whole, we can now, since 1992, point to the longest period of sustained low inflation averaging 2.7% on the Government's target measure, with relatively steady annual growth averaging 2.8% well above most estimates of our long-term trend rate, together with a sustained rise in the number of people
in employment - to an all-time high and an almost continuous month-by-month fall in the rate of
unemployment to the lowest rate for about 20 years.

But if the performance of the economy as a whole has been relatively encouraging over this period, that is
clearly not the case for every sector of the economy. And I am only too well aware that the internationallyexposed sectors - most of agriculture, much of manufacturing industry and some services sectors - wherever
they are located within the UK, have suffered. In many instances, depending on the particular international
profile of the business, they are continuing to suffer, as a result of the global economic developments that I
have already described. The resulting agony continues in many cases notwithstanding the present pick-up in
world demand, and is particularly acute for those businesses and sectors most exposed to the continuing
weakness of the euro. They no doubt include some of your own businesses.

I realise that to say that I sympathise with those of you in this situation - and I really do sympathise with you is scant consolation. But I want to assure you that we do not ignore the exchange rate in either our inflation
forecasts or in our monetary policy judgements. The strong exchange rate in itself has both a direct
dampening effect on our domestic price level and an indirect effect through lowering net external demand and both of these effects we take into account as best we can. Absent those effects of the strong exchange
rate - other things equal - policy would have needed to be correspondingly tighter. But while we do - and will
continue to - try to make full allowance for the strength of the exchange rate there are limits to just how far
we can sensibly go. The really hard question for us is could we - or should we - attempt to protect those
businesses most affected by the strong exchange rate even if that meant putting the economy as a whole at
significant risk of rising inflation. The reality is that, were we to do so - notwithstanding our specific mandate
from the Government - we would not succeed in protecting even the suffering sectors except possibly in the

very short term; and in the medium to long-term our overall economic performance - in terms of growth and
employment would - on all past experience - almost certainly be worse.

As it is, Mr President, the recovery in the world economy, and the extraordinary efforts of UK businesses
themselves to cope with the hostile international environment, are already resulting in a stronger net external
trade performance. That in turn is contributing to the recovery in our own economy, particularly in
manufacturing output growth and to the more encouraging news in recent surveys. To the extent that this
improvement in external demand persists, it will help to ease the exceptional pressures on the most
internationally-exposed sectors, and contribute to a better balance within the UK economy. But it needs, of
course, to be accompanied by corresponding moderation of the growth of domestic demand - after the
offsetting stimulus of a year ago - if we are to maintain overall stability. That essentially is why interest rates
have had to rise since last Autumn.

The broad prospect now for the UK economy as a whole over the next couple of years, which is the extent of
our forecasting horizon, is one of continuing relatively strong growth, with continuing relatively high
employment and continuing relatively low inflation. The monetary policy debate is a narrow one: it is about
just how strong the growth, just how high the employment and just how low the rate of inflation. It is as good
a prospect for the economy as a whole as we have known for some time.

And much the same is true of the overall economy here in Northern Ireland. You know better than I do. But
from the data, you, too, have enjoyed a sustained period of relatively steady growth - in fact you largely
avoided the recession that hit the rest of the UK at the beginning of the 1990s. The number of people in
employment here too is at its all-time high. And unemployment is at a 25 year low. As far as I can tell - from
the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre forecast of last autumn and from the regional CBI's recent
business confidence survey - that progress looks set to continue; indeed you may well out-perform the UK
economy as a whole.

That is an encouraging macro-economic background to the challenges facing Northern Ireland's new
Executive and Assembly. Huge progress has been made towards implementation of the Good Friday
agreement since I was last here in Belfast - the Referendum, the elections and the introduction of devolved
government. It is an immense tribute to the extraordinary efforts of the many people involved in keeping an
inevitably difficult process on track. The economic prize of permanent peace and political stability is
potentially very substantial. It will make Northern Ireland more attractive as a place in which to invest and in
which to live and work; it will make it more attractive, too, as a place to visit. And devolved government will
allow the fundamental supply-side issues, which are what determine the underlying sustainable growth rate
of the economy, to be addressed within the local community. That process has already begun with the report
last year of the Economic Development Strategy Review Steering Group - Strategy 2010. And, I agree with
their conclusion - that if you play to your considerable strengths and tackle the structural weaknesses which
they identify, then Northern Ireland can have a prosperous future.

We all have a part to play in this. The Bank of England's primary role is to help to maintain the stable macroeconomic environment - in the interests of the UK economy as a whole but in the interests also of Northern
Ireland. The specific purpose of my present visit is in fact to open, officially, our Northern Ireland Agency,
which is a direct result of my earlier visit. This completes our network of 12 regional agencies across the UK with the purpose of keeping ourselves more closely informed of regional economic developments. Previously
Neil Kemsley covered Northern Ireland from our Agency in Liverpool and is here to make his farewell - and I
am grateful to him for all that he did in reporting on developments here. But Nigel Falls - one of our most
experienced regional Agents - is now established here in Belfast itself. He is also with us today. I very much
hope that many of you will establish regular contact with him so that he can inform our Monetary Policy
Committee each month of the particular problems that exist in Northern Ireland, so that we can take them
into account in our monetary policy process. His reports will complement those which Roy Bailie, our NonExecutive Director here in Ireland, gives regularly to our Court of Directors.

In our monetary policy role the Bank operates essentially on the demand side of the economy - aiming to
keep aggregate demand in line with the supply-side capacity of the economy to meet that demand. But we
can also contribute directly on the supply-side, by helping to ensure that the financial system properly
supports the needs of the wider economy. We have in fact for some years now been working with the banks
and small business representative organisations at the national level, seeking to restore the relationships
between the small business sector and its main finance providers - which came under severe strain during
the recession in the early 1990s. I believe that we have made substantial progress in that - though we
continue to monitor the position - and I hope that Nigel will play a role in this process here at the local level.
We are now turning our attention to the provision of finance in more specific areas - to ethnic minority
businesses, for example, and to businesses that have hitherto been financially excluded. It is in this latter
area that the Bank has been strongly supportive of the Prince's Trust - and particularly of the Prince's Youth
Business Trust, with its aim of "helping young people who would not otherwise have the opportunity to
develop self-confidence, fulfil their ambitions and contribute to the community through the medium of selfemployment". I am delighted that the Prince's Trust have joined with the Chamber in organising today's
lunch. We all - as I say - have a part to play and the Prince's Youth Business Trust fills an important gap.

Mr President, as I said at the outset, a great deal has happened in a very short time since I was last here - in
the world economy, in the UK economy, and here in Northern Ireland, both economically and politically. It
has been in many respects a particularly testing time, but we have I believe come through it all quite
successfully and are now well placed to continue moving ahead. It will require sustained commitment from all
of us - but the people of Northern Ireland have never been lacking in commitment!

I wish you every possible success.
