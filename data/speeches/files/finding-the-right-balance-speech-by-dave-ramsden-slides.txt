Are there operational or other considerations that affect the level of
Bank of England reserves that could be supplied via OMOs?
How will the operating framework described here impact on day-today management of SMF participants’ reserves positions?
How will the operating framework described here impact on interbank and other money market activity and pricing relative to the
current floor system?
What will be the drivers of demand for Bank of England reserves
and what will be their relative importance?
How will the supply of reserves via OMOs affect their demand
relative to the current framework where supply is primarily via asset
purchases?
What approach(es) could be taken to estimate the expected
aggregate demand for reserves?

Comments should be sent to balancesheetDP@bankofengland.co.uk by
31st October 2018.
