I want to make four main points in this speech. First, in my view, the labour market currently seems likely to
tighten more this year than the external consensus expects, with further declines in unemployment and
under-employment. Second, recent data support the view that the equilibrium jobless rate is lower than it
used to be. Even so, the elevated level of labour shortages across a wide range of industries suggests there
is no longer significant labour market slack. Third, the tightening labour market and rising recruitment
difficulties probably will lift pay growth this year a bit above the recent subdued trends. Fourth, the economic
outlook may change significantly – either way – as and when there is greater clarity over the UK’s economic
relations with the EU and any transition to that end-state.

*******

Unemployment has fallen steadily for over six years, with the jobless rate down from the peak of 8.5% in
2011 to just 4.3% late last year, the lowest since 1975. Under-employment, which initially fell more slowly
1

than unemployment, also has fallen markedly in recent years (see figure 1) .
2

The view of the external consensus is that this decline in unemployment is now probably over, and that
unemployment is likely to stabilise or rise slightly this year. But my hunch is that the labour market will
probably tighten further this year, with the jobless rate dropping to -- and perhaps even below -- 4% during
2018, alongside further declines in under-employment.

This difference in outlook partly reflects my view that the economy and labour demand are likely to hold up a
bit better than many expect, and partly reflects the prospect that workforce growth – and hence potential
growth – may be weaker than generally expected.

To be sure, recent data show a slight drop in employment over the last three months. However, wider labour
market trends do not look weak in my view. For example, surveys suggest that firms’ hiring intentions are
slightly above average (see figure 2), while the level of job vacancies is around a record high. The
employment data are quite volatile from quarter to quarter, and the recent dip may just be a correction from
the unusually strong gains in prior months.

More broadly, business surveys suggest that the economy will probably continue to grow at 1½% -2% near
3

4

term (see figure 3), similar to the last year or two , and a little above the external consensus . Within that
outlook, consumer spending is likely to remain fairly sluggish, balanced by buoyant exports and a modest
gain in investment.

1

Under employment also has fallen markedly on the ONS measure, which counts people that would like to work more hours and those
who would like to work fewer hours.

See Consensus Economics, January 2018 survey, and also “Forecasts for the UK economy”, HM Treasury, December 2017. The IMF
and OECD have published similar forecasts.

I suspect we may eventually find that recent ONS GDP growth data are, as often happens, revised up a bit.

Consensus Economics report that the external consensus, as of January 2018, is for 1.4% GDP growth in 2018.

There are headwinds to growth. For example, households and businesses – both inside and outside the UK
– expect that Brexit will damage the economy over coming years (see figures 4, 5 and 6). These
expectations are probably already having some impact on activity, especially investment and housing. These
expectations have also squeezed consumers’ real incomes, through the inflation triggered by the
Brexit-related depreciation of sterling. Even though inflation has probably peaked, the adjustment to that real
income squeeze will probably still restrain spending in 2018.

Nevertheless, the economy also continues to be supported by several major positives.

First, global growth is buoyant, with broad-based expansion across the US, EU and Asia, and marked
upturns in world trade and investment. All this, plus the extra boost from sterling’s depreciation since 2015, is
supporting exports, business confidence and asset prices in the UK.

Second, overall corporate and household balance sheets in the UK have improved significantly in recent
years, with lower debt levels (relative to income) and higher holdings of liquid assets. Banks are better
capitalised and hence more resilient. Money and credit are growing steadily, more or less in line with
nominal GDP.

Third, background drivers are in place for a cyclical upturn in business investment, with the high return on
capital, low cost of capital, and high capacity use. Even with Brexit uncertainties, business surveys suggest
that investment intentions are around average.

Fourth, fiscal headwinds are likely to be more gradual than previously envisaged, following the late-2017
Autumn Budget.

Fifth, monetary conditions remain supportive, with low interest rates and reasonable credit availability. There
is little sign that the recent 25bp hike has triggered an outsized reaction from households, businesses and
financial markets. Consumer confidence and business activity are little changed, the yield curve remains
relatively flat and, with the decline in lending spreads over recent years, fixed mortgage rates remain lower
than 2-3 years ago (see figure 7). As a result, many people that currently have a fixed rate mortgage would
5

probably not face a rise in borrowing costs if they now had to replace that mortgage with a new loan .

Balancing out the positives and negatives, the nearterm outlook for the economy is not great, but nor is it
terrible. And even modest growth may well exceed the economy’s diminished rate of potential growth. To put
it differently, economic growth of around 1½-2% YoY may (as over the last year) be enough to tighten the
labour market significantly further.

Most estimates suggest that UK potential growth has slowed from around 2½% per year in the pre-crisis
6

period to about 1½% per year recently . If anything, I suspect that it may now be even lower, due to slower
workforce growth.

The decline in UK potential growth to around 1½% in recent years has reflected lower productivity growth,
7

which averaged just 0.7% per year over 2010-17 versus 1.9% YoY on average in 1997-07 . Productivity
growth also slowed in the US and euro area. But potential growth in those countries also has been reduced
by lower workforce growth, partly reflecting demographics, as well as (in some cases) other factors including
hysteresis from persistent high unemployment. By contrast, UK workforce growth has (until recently)
remained around ¾% per year, similar to the pre-crisis average and roughly twice the average pace in the
euro area (see figure 8).
Since 2012, the UK’s relatively high pace of workforce growth has largely been driven by inflows of foreign
8

workers, especially from other EU countries : the aggregate contribution to workforce growth from people
born in the UK has been close to zero (see figure 9). The boost to labour supply from inward migration in the
UK has been well above the EU average.
9

However, the growth of the foreign-born workforce in the UK has slowed sharply in recent quarters ,
10

especially people from other EU countries . Over 2013-16, inflows of people born in other EU countries
added 0.5pp per year on average to UK workforce growth: that boost has now fallen to roughly zero. This
has played a major role in reducing overall UK workforce growth from 1.0% YoY in 2016 to just 0.4% YoY in
11

late 2017, the latest data .
The slowdown in foreign worker inflows seems to reflect reduced labour supply – with citizens of other EU
countries less willing to work in the UK -- rather than reduced demand for labour in the UK. Reports from the
Bank’s regional agents and business surveys

12

highlight Brexit-related uncertainties, for example over future

job opportunities, benefit eligibility and health cover in the UK. Moreover, sterling’s Brexit-related
depreciation has reduced incentives to work in the UK – especially for people intending to send money home
13

-- because the UK’s relative wage levels have fallen in foreign currency terms .
6

This is the view of the OBR, OECD, IMF and external consensus.
See Tenreyro (2018).
For example, from Q4 2012 to Q4 2016, the UK workforce rose by 1.0 million people, or 3.0% (an average of 0.75% per year). Over
that period, the number of UK-born people in the workforce fell slightly (down 69K, 0.2%). The number of foreign-born people in the UK
workforce rose by 1.1 million, 22%, mostly people born in other EU countries (up 0.7 million, 40%). There was little change in the
participation rate of foreign-born people.
9
The foreign-born workforce rose by just 84K YoY in Q3 2017 (adding 0.2% to the UK workforce), less than a third of the average
growth in the prior four years. The number of EU-born people in the UK workforce rose by only 8K YoY in Q3 2017 versus 170k per year
over prior four years.
10
The ONS migration data, which extend to Q2 2017, suggest that the reduced net inflow chiefly reflects lower inflows of EU citizens,
but there has also been a rise in outflows of EU citizens from the UK.
11
By region, workforce growth remains positive in London and SE England. Across the other UK regions combined, the workforce is
down 0.2% YoY.
12
See for example “The Brexit effect on EU nationals”, KPMG, 25 August 2017.
13
World Bank data put remittances from the UK to other EU countries at $8.8bn in 2016 (35% of total remittances sent from the UK), up
from $6.3bn in 2010. In 2016, there were on average 2.3 million EU nationals working in the UK. So, if one assumes that the remittance
outflow is entirely driven by EU nationals, then this works out as an average of $3800 per person per year.

There may also be an impact from stronger growth and reduced slack elsewhere, especially in the countries
that until recently saw outflows of workers. For the EU as a whole, unemployment is at a 9-year low, and the
share of firms that report output is constrained by labour shortages is at a record high – with very high
14

readings in the A8 countries (see figure 10). Wage growth in the A8 countries has picked up markedly .
Even Germany, which obviously is not leaving the EU, has seen a sharp slowdown in the number of citizens
15

from other EU countries in its workforce .

Prospects for migration flows are uncertain. But my own view is that, given the tightening in labour markets
elsewhere and ongoing Brexit uncertainties, net inflows from EU countries to the UK workforce in coming
years will remain much lower than in recent years. I would not be surprised if they turn negative – ie more
people leave than arrive -- at some stage.

It seems unlikely that the reduction in labour supply growth from lower net inflows of foreign workers will be
fully offset by a rise in participation rates. The UK participation rate is already around a record high, and the
number of people that are not counted in the workforce but say they would like a job is around a record
16

low .

With reduced workforce growth, productivity growth would need to pick up substantially to keep potential
economic growth at around 1½% YoY. There is little sign of this at present. Productivity did rise markedly in
Q3 in QoQ terms -- the flipside of the drop in employment noted earlier. But this followed a couple of very
weak quarters for productivity. The YoY pace, at 0.8%, is similar to the subdued trends of recent years.

I do not believe that the UK is inevitably locked into persistent low productivity growth. Technological
innovation remains high and there is ample scope for UK productivity to catch up to the higher levels
elsewhere, for example, the US and Germany.

However, the route to a sustained pickup in productivity growth probably relies on higher levels of investment
17

and training. At present, there is little sign that these are changing dramatically . Moreover, the drop in
inward migration seems to be adversely affecting workforce quality, which may cap future productivity gains.
Over 2006-2016, the number of graduates in the UK workforce rose by an average of 4.1% YoY, somewhat
18

above the EU average (3.3% YoY). Roughly one third of that rise in the UK reflected foreign citizens . Now,
with reduced foreign worker inflows, the number of graduates in the UK workforce is up just 0.6% YoY (Q3

14

Wages and salaries per hour in the A8 countries rose by an average of 7.4% YoY in Q1-Q3 2017 (latest data, GDP weighted across
countries) compared to roughly 4% YoY in 2015 and 2016.
15
The number of non-German EU citizens in Germany’s workforce rose 0.7% YoY in 2017Q3, versus average gains of 10.0% YoY in
2013-16.
16
Moreover, participation rates among people aged 65+ years, which had been rising, have flattened off recently. The UK participation
rate among people aged 65-74 years is already the equal second highest among the EU15 countries, exceeded only by Sweden.
17
The CBI reports that the balance of firms intending to invest more in training is similar to the average of the last five years for both the
manufacturing and service sectors.
18
49% of foreign citizens in the UK workforce (aged 15-64 years) have tertiary education, versus 37% of UK citizens. In 2016, half of the
rise in the stock of graduates in the UK workforce reflected foreign citizens.

2017, latest data), the lowest growth since quarterly data began in 2000

19

and among the lowest of any EU

country (see figure 11).

All this points to the possibility that UK potential growth may now be below 1½%. For example, the OECD
estimates euro area potential growth at around 1%. The UK and euro area have had similarly low rates of
productivity growth in recent years. The difference in potential growth reflects the greater boost to the UK
workforce from inward migration. Take this away and, unless UK productivity growth rises markedly, UK
potential growth would be similar to the meagre euro area pace. I stress that monetary policy can do very
little to lift trends in potential growth or productivity growth.

Of course, the drop in foreign worker inflows reduces demand in the economy as well as supply. For
example, it is likely to already be hitting consumer spending, with an impact roughly proportionate to the drop
20

in workforce growth . However, the adverse effects on overall GDP may not necessarily be as immediate.
The impact on investment may be bigger or smaller, depending on the extent to which foreign workers are a
complement or a substitute for the capital stock. And lower workforce growth probably only affects exports
through a gradual process of capacity constraints and upward pressures on pay – which will eventually
reduce demand for UK exports to match the reduced potential supply – rather than the immediate effects that
would be likely for consumer spending. Either way, the signs so far are that the economy as a whole is
growing steadily despite this headwind.
Overall, I suspect that – in line with business surveys – the economy will probably continue to grow steadily
at around its recent pace, and as a result the labour market will tighten further.

Let me turn to prospects for the growth of labour costs, especially pay.

The economy currently seems to have limited slack. Business surveys, including the BoE Agents, suggest
that staff recruitment difficulties have worsened over the last year – especially for skilled and professional
staff -- and are similar to pre-crisis peaks (see figure 12). Unemployment is low by historic norms, with
short-term unemployment at a record low. The net balance of people wanting to work more hours has fallen
close to zero. Consistent with this, inflation among CPI components that are driven chiefly by domestic
factors is close to a target-consistent pace, assuming a normal trend in import prices. From this starting
point, my hunch is that further tightening in the labour market is likely to cause underlying pay growth to pick
up from about 2¼% recently to about 3% this year and probably a little higher next year.

Now, I am fully aware that pay growth has repeatedly undershot the forecasts of the MPC and external
consensus in recent years. This has led some people to argue that the wage Phillips curve – the theory that
19

Annual data for the UK go back to 1993 and the latest figure is below any annual average for that period.
The effect on consumer spending may be less than the effect on the workforce if foreign workers send significant remittances home.
The recycling of such remittances into increased demand for UK exports is likely to be limited given the UK’s modest share in world
trade.

lower unemployment will lift pay growth – is effectively dead or flat, with the result that falling unemployment
produces little or no upward effect on pay growth.

However, I still think the wage Phillips curve is a useful framework, especially if broadened to include trends
in productivity growth and inflation expectations. Various factors have probably shifted the UK Phillips curve
down in recent years – implying lower pay growth for a given jobless rate. These factors include wider
education attainment, changes to the tax and benefit system, the spread of less secure forms of
21

employment, more widespread under-employment and so forth (see figure 13) .

Recognising this, the MPC a year ago cut its estimate of the equilibrium jobless rate (U*) from 5% to 4½%.
This would imply that the economy can probably operate with a lower unemployment rate than in the past.
22

As I have said before , I consider it possible that the equilibrium jobless rate is slightly below 4½%. But I
doubt it is very much lower. Pay growth in recent years has followed a path broadly consistent with a 4½%
U* estimate, given trends in inflation expectations and productivity growth. The same holds for the latest
data, for Q3 2017. The wage Phillips curve is also intact at a regional level, although there is tentative
evidence that it has flattened a bit in the last few years compared to estimates up to 2011 or 2014, such that
23

wage growth reacts a bit less than previously to any given drop in unemployment (see figure 14) . It appears
to me that the Phillips curve has shifted, but not vanished.

Moreover, pay growth during 2017 probably has not fully reflected the recent labour market tightening.

First, YoY pay growth typically reacts to changes in the jobless rate with a lag of several quarters. As such,
pay trends in 2017 probably tell us more about labour market slack in 2016 than in 2017. And these lags
may currently be a little longer than usual. For several years, the recession left a hangover of caution and job
insecurity, which limited the extent to which people moved job for slightly better pay. In turn, the relatively low
level of job-to-job moves in recent years has probably reduced the extent to which firms feel pressure to
raise pay to retain staff. This has led to an unusually wide gap between pay growth for job movers (8.0%
YoY on average in 2016-2017, similar to the pre-crisis norm) and for those who stay in the same job (2.6%,
well below the pre-crisis norm), see figure 15. Anecdotally, firms report they must pay up for new hires but so
far have to an extent been able to limit passing on the higher pay levels to existing staff. In recent quarters,
24

the number of job-to-job moves has returned to something like the pre-crisis norm (see figure 16) . Over
time, I would expect the tight labour market and wide gap in pay growth between job movers and job-stayers
to encourage more people to move job and pressure firms to pay more to keep staff.

21

See Haldane (2017) and Saunders (2017).
See evidence to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, November 2017.
The Phillips curve estimates ending in 2017 are not flatter than those for the pre-crisis period, although it is difficult to estimate a
Phillips Curve in the pre-crisis period, most probably because the economy and labour market were close to trend. See Leduc and
Wilson (2017) for the US experience.
24
The rise in the numbers of self-employed, who report very low levels of job-to-job flows, has probably reduced the normal level of
overall job-to-job flows. Adjusting for this, the number of job-to-job flows is very close to the 2001-07 average.

Second, composition effects have been unusually negative in recent AWE data, cutting roughly 0.5p off YoY
pay growth in Q3 2017 (see figure 17). The AWE data measure the average level of pay per person per
week across a wide sample of firms and hence are affected by changes in the mix of employment between
25

people or sectors with differing pay levels . Composition effects have become increasingly counter-cyclical
in recent years – in other words, more negative when unemployment is falling -- especially those relating to
26

the age, qualifications and tenure of staff . In my view, if one is looking at changes in pay growth as a guide
27

to changes in cost and inflation pressures, it is useful to strip out such composition effects , because they
probably have a similar effect on productivity and hence leave unit labour cost growth unaffected. Excluding
composition effects, pay growth is already close to 3% YoY. Composition effects may well continue to reduce
average earnings growth in 2018 if, as I suspect, unemployment continues to edge down. Nevertheless,
unless composition effects increase further from the recent high pace, they will not be enough to prevent
AWE growth from moving higher if underlying pay growth picks up further.

Third, pay growth in recent years has understated the rise in total labour costs, with large rises in non-wage
28

costs, including national insurance taxes , contributions to DB pension schemes, auto enrolment, the
29

Apprentice Levy and so forth (see figure 18) . Even with subdued pay growth, overall unit labour cost growth
30

in the last couple of years averaged about 2½% YoY, similar to the pre-crisis average . This pace is
probably roughly consistent with the inflation target over time, assuming a normal trend in import prices.
Some non-wage costs, eg lump sum contributions to a closed DB pension scheme, are probably best viewed
31

as fixed costs rather than marginal costs and are unlikely to have much influence on wages or prices . But
some, eg auto enrolment, are akin to deferred compensation and probably do affect firms’ marginal costs
and prices. To the extent that firms and workers view such non-wage costs as part of overall compensation,
32

increases in non-wage costs may also have had some dampening effect on pay growth . Looking ahead,
auto enrolment costs will continue to rise for many firms in 2018-19. If the growth of non-wage costs were to
remain high, then it would be ever more important to keep an eye on total labour cost growth rather than just
average earnings.
33

Moreover, while high inward migration has not significantly reduced overall pay levels in recent years , the
ample availability of foreign workers may, until very recently, have limited somewhat the extent to which pay
34

growth responds to low UK unemployment . When both firms and workers know it is still relatively easy to
25

See Broadbent (2015) and page 32 of November 2017 Inflation Report.
Reflecting such factors, the average level of pay among people that are in work at a given date and also in work a year earlier is
typically about 40% above that for people who were not in work a year earlier.
27
For example, the Employment Cost Index in the US is adjusted for composition effects.
28
Both the employer and employee rates rose by 1pp in 2011.

See Bell and Whitaker (2017).

The ULC data do not include the Apprentice Levy.
31
See Inflation Report of November 2016, pages 14-15.
32
The CIPD reports that 12% of firms cite increases in non-wage labour costs as a factor likely to restrain pay growth in 2018, the equal
third highest factor. In addition, 10% of firms cite costs of auto enrolment, and 8% of firms cite costs of the Apprentice Levy, as key
factors likely to restrain pay growth. See CIPD/Adecco Labour Market Outlook November 2017.
33
See Nickel and Salaheen (2015).
34
There is a similar argument in the UK section of OECD (2006): “international as well as UK evidence suggests that immigration can
serve to make the labour market as a whole more fluid and wages less sensitive to demand fluctuations.” See also Blanchflower,
Salaheen and Shadforth (2007).

hire people from outside the UK for jobs in the UK, the appropriate measure of slack widens to encompass
all potential applicants for jobs in the UK, including people currently outside the UK. This wide concept of
slack is difficult to measure but, until recently, has probably been relatively high despite low unemployment in
the UK. As a result, the Phillips curve measured against UK unemployment may have appeared relatively flat
(and/or perhaps a lower U*). With availability of foreign workers now apparently declining – partly reflecting
reduced external slack – skill shortages are becoming more acute and low UK unemployment may have a
35

greater influence on UK pay growth, in effect reviving and re-steepening the wage Phillips curve .

To be sure, pay growth in 2018 is likely to stay well below the pre-crisis norm of 4% or so. But, I suspect it is
more likely to overshoot than undershoot the external consensus (which is for AWE growth of 2.6% in 2018
36

and 2.8% in 2019) . The Nov-2017 IR projected pay growth to pick up to around 3% in 2018 as a whole.
Even with some pick up in productivity, such a trend would probably signal the likelihood that CPI inflation
will stay above target over time once the direct boost to inflation from sterling’s depreciation fades. Indeed,
pay growth in 2018 could rise above 3% YoY, especially if composition effects unwind and underlying pay
growth picks up further.

Let me turn to Brexit. The MPC’s economic forecasts are based upon a range of possible longrun outcomes
for the UK’s trading relations with the EU and elsewhere, and assume the economy adjusts smoothly over a
number of years. To be clear, our forecasts do not explicitly assume a particular length of transition period,
still less what the details of that transition might be. But regardless of that, what matters for the economy
right now and in the future are the collective expectations of households, business and financial markets
rather than the MPC’s assumptions. So far these private sector expectations seem broadly consistent with
our assumption of a reasonably smooth adjustment and modest longrun adverse effects on the economy.
And, as noted earlier, anticipation of these effects seems to be already dampening economic activity to an
extent.

It is possible that the expectations of households, business and markets will move around in coming months
in response to twists and turns in the Brexit negotiations. As we have said, the MPC will not be giving a
running commentary on the state of negotiations. But in our economic forecasts we will, of course, be
sensitive to observed changes in business and consumer confidence, as well as financial markets, in this
period. As and when there is greater clarity on the UK’s eventual trading relations with the EU, and any
transition period, then those decisions -- and any resultant changes in private sector expectations and asset
prices -- could well affect the economy’s prospects, including growth, potential growth and inflation, in a
material way. These effects could go either way.

Conclusion

Let me finish with some comments on monetary policy.
In the exceptional circumstances since the EU referendum, the MPC is – consistent with our remit -- aiming
for an appropriate tradeoff between the speed with which inflation returns to target and the extent of spare
capacity. If the prospective terms of that tradeoff change, then it is natural for monetary policy to respond. I
stress that monetary policy is driven far more by inflation prospects over the next 2-3 years than the actual
inflation rate over the latest 12 months.
If the economy turns out broadly in line with the outlook I have described – labour market tightness and signs
of higher pay growth -- I consider it likely that interest rates will need to rise further over time. As with other
MPC members, I expect that any further tightening will be limited and gradual. But I am not going to
pre-announce how I might vote at any particular future MPC meeting. There is plenty of data to see and
analysis to do before we get to that. In particular, the February Inflation Report will include the results of our
annual supply stock-take, which will include consideration of prospects for productivity, equilibrium
unemployment, migration and labour supply.
37

There is considerable uncertainty over the exact level of interest rates that is neutral , but I am fairly
confident that we are below that level at present, especially if one allows for the stimulus from the stock of
asset purchases. It follows that a modest further rise in rates would still imply a shift towards neutral, rather
than an outright move to a restrictive policy stance. We would be gradually lifting our foot off the accelerator,
with no need to put the brakes on.

But the path of monetary policy is not preset. In particular, consistent with our remit, the MPC has said that
any monetary policy implications from Brexit developments would not be automatic, and would depend on
changes in supply, demand and the exchange rate. It is certainly not correct to assume that “good” or “bad”
Brexit news automatically implies that interest rates must go in a particular direction. The MPC has tools to
respond either way as needed to changes in the economic outlook.
