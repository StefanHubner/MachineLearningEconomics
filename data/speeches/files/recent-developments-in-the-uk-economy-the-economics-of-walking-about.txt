It is a great pleasure to be here today to deliver the second Bernard Corry Memorial
lecture. Bernard was my mentor, friend and inspiration and I miss him greatly. I guess
he was the first one to really have believed in me and I think he would have been amused
that one of his boys now has an office on Threadneedle Street.
I believe I first met Bernard in 1984. He was the external examiner on my Masters thesis
from the University of Wales. He eventually offered me a place at Queen Mary to do a
PhD as well as the first CASS scholarship from the ESRC, which involved me spending a
lot of time at the Department of Employment with Neil Millward and learning how to
work with Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) data. I spent a couple of years
here and met David, now Lord, Currie and Maurice, now Lord, Peston who had intended
to be here to chair this lecture, but he has been unwell and couldn't be here so I wish him
a swift recovery. I also recall with some pleasure the three Festschrift volumes for
Bernard and Maurice that John Grahl and Sami Daniel organised so well a few years ago,
for which I contributed a chapter, as did many of his former students and colleagues. I
was particularly upset to learn that Sami Daniel, also died earlier this year.
I remember, all those years ago, many hours spent discussing Bernard's passion for
Economics. Perhaps the biggest thing Bernard ever taught me was to try and understand
the low-side risk of any policy prescription, by which I mean always worry about the
consequences if you are wrong. I remember him telling me on numerous occasions that I
should be concerned about the welfare of the man on the Clapham omnibus. In part this
was to ensure that economists did no harm, and also because Bernard never forgot his
East End roots and understood that this bus passenger was paying his salary.
Bernard always encouraged me to look at the data carefully and to sniff the air. To adopt
a more “investigative” approach, if you like: to put the data before the theory. I like to
refer to this as the ‘economics of walking about.’ He pointed me to the writings of the
early American labour economists Paul Douglas; John Dunlop; Clark Kerr; Richard
Lester; Lloyd Reynolds; Sumner Slichter and Gregg Lewis. Clark Kerr encapsulated the
spirit of these American labour economists when he said “Labour Economics will
contribute more by helping to make a sense of reality than by building more castles in the
air” (Kerr, 1988, p.33). While the analytical tradition in Labour Economics is really
American, in fact it extends back to the Webbs in the UK, as David Metcalf pointed out
to me recently. The tradition extends on at the Bank where we have twelve Agents and
their staff around the country who stay in touch with businesses to ensure MPC members
keep their feet on the ground. We also do frequent trips around the country with the
Agents talking to business men and women and I find such trips an invaluable way to
find out what is going on. That is particularly important given that most of the
quantitative data we receive will get revised and so it is always hard to know where we
are today.
I was also heavily influenced by a 1991 paper by Larry Summers, until recently Harvard
president.
The paper was entitled “The Scientific Illusion in Empirical
Macroeconomics”, and it seems particularly apposite to me today given my new MPC
role. In it Larry wrote:

1

“formal empirical work which…‘tries to take models seriously
econometrically’ has had almost no influence on serious thinking about
substantive as opposed to methodological questions. Instead the only
empirical research that has influenced thinking about substantive questions
has been based on methodological principles directly opposed to those that
have become fashionable in recent years. Successful empirical research
has been characterized by attempts to gauge the strengths of associations
rather than to estimate structural parameters, verbal characterizations of
how causal relations might operate rather than explicit mathematical
models, and the skilful use of carefully chosen natural experiments rather
than sophisticated statistical techniques to achieve identification.”
(Summers, (1991), p. 129).
And later
“Good empirical evidence tells its story regardless of the precise way in
which it is analyzed. In large part it is its simplicity that makes it
persuasive. Physicists do not compete to find more elaborate ways to
observe falling apples. Instead they have made progress because theory
has sought inspiration from a wide range of empirical phenomena.
Macroeconomics could progress in the same way. But progress is unlikely
as long as macroeconomists require the armor of a stochastic pseudoworld before doing battle with evidence from the real one.” (Summers,
1991, p. 146)
The use of empirical data is the theme I am going to talk about today and hence the
subtitle, 'the economics of walking about'. I’m going to discuss some questions I have
been examining in my research which are based on what is really going on in the UK
economy. Not what should be going on, on a Ceteris Paribus basis! This is in direct
contrast to much of economics that apparently believes the real world is a special case of
a special case and uninteresting. In my view economics is not just about understanding
mathematics or elegant theoretical models; as Arnold Harberger (1993) noted “economics
is fundamentally an observational discipline”. The research behind this lecture uses many
of the tools that Bernard taught me, to analyse the UK economy at the current
conjuncture. It has frequently involved searching for patterns in the data. In making my
decisions on interest rates month by month I watch the data closely.
I examine five questions:
1) Why have unemployment and inactivity increased recently?
2) Why has most of the job growth in recent years been in self-employment?
3) What has been happening to capacity within firms?
4) Why has wage growth been benign recently?
5) Why has inflation failed to respond to higher money growth?

2

1) Why have unemployment and inactivity increased recently?
There has been a significant improvement in the level of unemployment prevailing in the
UK not just since 1997, but considerably earlier (Chart 1). The most notable feature of
the immediate post-war era was of low rates of unemployment – which averaged 2.5%
from 1945-1975. This situation reversed itself at the end of the 1970s when the
unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in June 1979 to 11.9% in June 1984. The
unemployment rate declined to 6.9% in June 1990, then increased to a new peak rate of
9.4% in September 1994, and subsequently declined again until September 2005 to 4.7%.
Table 1 sets out the major changes in the composition of the UK labour force for the
period 1997-2007Q1. Most notable is the decline in unemployment, with 300,000 fewer
jobless individuals in 2007Q1 than in 1997. Employment increased by more than 2.5
million over the same period. The unemployment rate thus fell from 7.2% to 5.5%
between these years, while both the employment and activity rates rose.
A decline in the unemployment rate has by no means been restricted to the UK: in the
past decade, unemployment rates around the OECD have been lower than in the previous
decade (Blanchflower 2007). This would suggest that part of the explanation for the
improvement in UK unemployment could have been the result of global factors. Despite
claims to the contrary in the OECD Jobs Study and by Layard, Nickell and Jackman
(1998) in their unemployment book and elsewhere, rates of unemployment over time by
country show little or no statistical association with conventional measures of institutions
and policies (Baker et al, 2005). There is also scant association with the deregulations of
the 1990s and trends in unemployment.
Despite conventional wisdom high
unemployment does not seem to be primarily the result of job protection, labour taxes,
trade union power or wage inflexibility (Blanchflower, 2001). By contrast, product
market, capital market and housing market reforms all seem significant in explaining
falling unemployment. However, the most important factors behind the decline in UK
unemployment were probably welfare reforms involving reductions in the replacement
rate along with tightening of benefit rules (Nickell, 2006).
Table 1 shows that unemployment has trended up since 2005Q1, and increased by 13,000
in the most recent quarter (2007Q1). Over the same two-year period, there have also
been increases in the numbers of temporary workers saying they couldn't get permanent
jobs (+42,000), and numbers of part-time workers saying they couldn't get full-time jobs
(+89,000). Set against this is the rather surprising finding that employment has also
increased, by +305,000, driven by an increase in the numbers of self-employed
(+217,000).1 However, there has also been a dramatic increase in the numbers of
individuals who have exited the labour market, so are now classified as inactive or Out of
the Labour Force (OLF) – their number has swelled by +135,000 over the last quarter.
This is in contrast to the sharp rises in participation observed between 2004 and 2006,
and now looks more consistent with the unemployment data (Chart 1). The majority of

government training schemes and unpaid family members fell by -28,000.

individuals leaving the labour market have been women, with the largest group women
over retirement age. This looks to me like discouraged workers unable to find work in a
loosening labour market. Of course, one quarter does not necessarily indicate a trend, but
we should always be on the lookout for significant changes in the data, of which this may
be a prelude. The increase in inactivity by age in 2007Q1 was as follows.

In addition, worryingly, the proportion of total unemployment accounted for by those
aged under 24 has ticked up over time. For example, in 1997 18-24 year olds constituted
23.9% of the unemployed compared with 30.4% in January-March 2007. Indeed,
Quintini et al (2007) have noted that over the period 1995-2005 the UK had the largest
increase in the ratio of youth to adult unemployment rates in the OECD (Chart 2); the UK
moved from having a ratio below the OECD average in 1995 to being well above it in
2005.2 There is no good explanation for the increase in youth unemployment, however
(Blanchflower et al. 2007). It does not appear that young workers have been crowded out
by immigrants, nor older workers returning to the workplace.
My Masters thesis, which Bernard examined twenty-odd years ago, was on the causes
and consequences of youth unemployment, and it appears that the same issues remain
pertinent today.
2) Why has most of the job growth in recent years been in self-employment?
Self-employment as a proportion of the UK workforce is high by international standards
(Blanchflower, 2000, 2005). Chart 3 shows that self-employment rose from around 7%
in the late 1970s, peaking at 14.0% in 1991, before easing back slightly during the late
1990s to below 12.0%, and then recovering again. What explains these patterns?
It is apparent from Chart 3 that the largest increase in the self-employment rate was
during the 1980s. During this decade several factors appear to have combined to push the
number of self-employed workers higher. First, there was a shift towards service sector
industries, which one might assume have lower barriers to entry than manufacturing.
Second, the decade was noteworthy for the extent of financial liberalisation that occurred.
Loosening liquidity constraints tend to provide a boost to self employment (Blanchflower

This is not just a case of adult unemployment falling. The unemployment rate of those aged 16-17 has
risen from 19.1% in 2001 to 24.6% in 2006. Source: ONS.

and Oswald, (1998); Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman, (2002)). This enabled many
latent entrepreneurs access to credit markets, which were previously closed to them.
The increased availability of credit also facilitated a house price boom, which
subsequently allowed homeowners to extract equity with which to invest in their own
businesses. Black et al (1996), for example, found that a 10% rise in the value of housing
equity increased the number of new firm VAT registrations in the UK by some 5%.
Taylor (2004) found that increases in house prices raised the probability of selfemployment entry.
Third, government policy was introduced that actively encouraged workers to become
self-employed. An example of these policies was the Enterprise Allowance Scheme
(EAS), which ran from 1983 to 1991, paying self-employed workers a supplementary
weekly income (of around £40 a week) for up to 12 months. In the twelve months
following the scheme’s introduction, self-employment rose by +266,000, the largest
recorded annual increase of the past 40 years. Campbell and Daly (1992) estimate that
one in eight of those that became self-employed during the late 1980s were supported
into employment through this scheme.
The subsequent decline in the self-employment rate observed from 1995 resulted from a
shift in a large number of workers from self-employment to employment within the
construction industry. This reflected work by the Inland Revenue to stop employers
treating employees as self-employed workers in order to avoid paying NIC’s, nor provide
benefits, training or observe employment protection laws. While the total number of
workers employed in the construction industry remained steady at just over 18 million
between 1995 and 2000, the proportion of workers declaring themselves to be selfemployed fell from 46% to 33%. By 1997, 200,000 construction workers had reclassified
themselves as employees, explaining most of the reduction in self-employment in
construction between 1995 and 1997.
In the year September 2002 to September 2003 the number of self-employed increased by
280,000. The largest increase of 120,000 was found in banking, finance and insurance
and was dominated by the 35-49 age group, although there were also large increases in
the 50-64/59 and 65/60 and over age groups. During this period a number of tax changes
were implemented, including: reform of capital gains tax; reducing the rate of corporation
tax on smaller companies; the introduction of stakeholder pensions; and the abolition of
Advance Corporation Tax.
Over the past couple of years there has been further substantial growth in the numbers of
self-employed as well as in the self-employment rate. The numbers of self-employed
over the period 2005Q1 to 2007Q1 increased by 217,000, accounting for a remarkable
71.1% of the total growth of employment of 305,000 over the period. Moreover, only
37.6% of the additional employee jobs were full-time compared with 61.8% of selfemployed jobs. In addition, over the most recent quarter, January-March 2007, the
number of employees fell by 100,000 while the number of self-employed grew by 45,000.

5

At this time it is by no means obvious why self-employment has increased so sharply in
recent months. In part it is because of increased immigration – since immigrants have a
higher propensity to be self-employed – alongside moves to self-employment from some
older workers who had previously been out of the labour force (Blanchflower and
Shadforth, 2007). The rise in self-employment in part likely reflects the lack of employee
jobs in a loose labour market.
The recent rise in self-employment could also be consistent with continuing increases in
house prices, which have helped to further loosen capital constraints. Chris Shadforth and
I have re-examined this relationship for the most recent data. Table 2 records the results
where we regress the log of the self employment rate, defined by UK region and year on
the (log) house price and the log of the regional unemployment rate as well as a full set of
year dummies.3 In each of the four columns the house price variable enters significantly
positive with or without a lagged dependent variable or with region fixed effects. The
unemployment rate is only significant in column 1 and is never significant in the presence
of region fixed effects or a lagged dependent variable. The self-employment house price
elasticity means that a doubling of house prices leads to an increase in the selfemployment rate of 15.4%, so the effect isn't small. We take this as evidence of liquidity
constraints being relieved as house prices rise – entirely consistent with the findings of
Black et al (1996) for an earlier period.
It does not appear that the most recent increase in self-employment (i.e. over the past two
years) has been the result of changes in regulation, tax changes or changes in the
minimum wage. It seems unlikely that the current rate of growth in self-employment is
sustainable in the long-run.
3) What has happened to capacity within firms?
My reading of the labour data is that the market has loosened over the past year or so.
The other sort of capacity constraint faced by firms reflects how hard they have to work
their incumbent factors of production to meet demand – i.e. capacity constraints within
firms. The sum of capacity within firms and in the labour market is usually called the
output gap.
Survey evidence suggests that capacity utilisation within firms is currently above
‘normal’ levels. Chart 4 shows that the CBI measure of spare capacity within
manufacturing firms has been in excess of its post-1996 average since March 2006. The
BCC measures of spare capacity for both manufacturing and service sector firms are also
above their post-1996 averages (Chart 5). But these series are volatile. One only has to
look back over the past 12 months to see that all three measures have risen and then fallen
sharply at times. Looking through these movements, however, it does appear to me that
there is evidence that spare capacity within firms has fallen over the past 9 to 12 months.
In any case, I have trouble understanding what capacity pressures in services actually
3

The year dummies are proxying inflation, hence the house price variable should be thought of in real
terms; indeed, the results are even stronger (compared with the initial specification in column 1) when the
year dummies are replaced with an (insignificant) aggregate price deflator.

means, over and above the skilled labour shortages that have been highlighted by the
Bank’s Agents in their recent surveys. New computers can be bought in an hour;
equipment can be rented and work can be farmed out to consultants or sub-contractors.
The availability of the internet and fast communications means that workers can work
from home if necessary. So, what precisely are the constraints on firms that supposedly
are binding in services? I’m not sure.
Nevertheless, signs of limited spare capacity may be a concern if they prelude price
increases. There is tentative evidence from a number of surveys that some firms have
become more confident about pushing through price increases. This may reflect buoyant
expectations regarding future demand or simply a delayed pass-through of higher input
prices. But the evidence is mixed. For example, the CBI measure of manufacturing
firms’ expected price increases over the next three months was above its 2006 average in
2007Q1, but the comparable BCC measure had declined. Furthermore, the surveys have
little predictive power for actual output price increases one-year ahead; the correlation
coefficient for CBI expected prices and output prices 12-months later is 0.56, while the
coefficient using BCC expected prices is just 0.09.4 As such, it is difficult to interpret
what the data are actually telling us about future inflationary pressures at present,
although they do seem to point to an upside risk.
It is hard to reconcile the recent increases in unemployment and inactivity with what is
happening within firms. The evidence would seem to support the observed steady
increase in labour productivity since 2005, which suggests that firms have been working
their workforce and plant more intensively. Strictly, we would expect such an increase in
capacity utilisation to result in a tightening of the labour market, and increased pay
pressures. Since that has not occurred, I must presume that the weakness in the labour
market (however caused) has more than offset the increased constraints within firms.
4) Why has wage growth been benign recently?
Consistent with the finding of a loose labour market and increased self-employment,
wage growth has been flat or slowing on most measures since late 2004, as indicated in
Chart 6. The Average Earnings Index and Average Weekly Earnings series excluding
bonuses have shown little or no tendency to increase; if anything they have declined
slightly over the past twelve months or so. Earnings excluding bonuses, averaged over
three months, rose by 3.7% in the year to March 2007, compared with 3.9% in March
2006 and 4.1% in March 2005.
In contrast, average earnings including bonuses increased at an annual rate of 4.5% in
March 2007, compared with 4.0% in 2006 and 4.5% in 2005. However, the pick-up in
this headline series is confined to the financial services sector. Contrary to the claims of
some that bonuses are volatile and should be smoothed through there are much stronger
arguments for actually ignoring them entirely as long as they are based on performance
and especially so if they are derived from some market risk (see Weitzman (1984) and
Blanchflower and Oswald (1987, 1998)); for example, an increase in basic pay of ₤1,000

BCC data may reflect the shorter period over which data are available.

this year would add to household income in all future years, and has quite different
implications from a one-off bonus of ₤1,000.
In any case, the estimates derived both with and without bonuses are likely to be upward
biased estimates of wages. The data files used, by definition, exclude the earnings of the
self-employed, which, as discussed above, account for 13% of total employment. The
files also exclude data from workers in the smallest workplaces, which account for a
further 13% or so of the workforce. The wages of these workers are more flexible than
other workers in the economy when labour markets loosen (or tighten), that is to say they
have a higher wage-unemployment elasticity.
The evidence of benign wage inflation in the official data is confirmed by the Bank’s
Agents who found that pay awards slowed in April (Agents’ Summary of Business
Conditions, Bank of England, May 2007).5 It is also consistent with recent evidence
provided by IRS in their Pay and Benefits Bulletin, Issue: 663 (18/5/2007). Their
provisional analysis of pay settlements collected for the three months to 30 April 2007
revealed a sharp decrease in the IRS measure of pay awards - the midpoint in the range of
basic pay deals - to 3%.6 This is half a percentage point lower than the 3.5% level at
which pay awards have held for the previous three rolling quarters. It is, however,
inconsistent with the findings in KPMG’s Report on Jobs, 9th May 2007 which found that
‘permanent salary inflation was the strongest in nearly seven years in April. This survey
tends not to correlate well with official earnings measures or settlements presumably
because it is drawn from a biased sample, only covering workers placed in permanent
jobs by some recruitment consultancies.
Some of these publications also highlight the issue of skilled worker shortages, but this is
a fact of life in a dynamic economy. There is a remarkable amount of churning going on
in an economy as firms are born and others die (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1998). The
question is whether this has become greater than was the case in the past and I see no
evidence of this whatsoever, outside Financial Services. Every insurance company would
always like five more salesmen who could sell thousands of policies, but that doesn’t
mean that wages are going to rise. In any case, the occupations that are in short supply
and whose wages have risen are included in the wage data.
So, in my opinion, at this point in time, it appears that wages are the dog that hasn’t
barked. My view is that wages are not going to increase much any time soon when insider
and outsider pressures are low. By that I mean, firms don’t have the ability to pay as
their profits have been squeezed (insider power is low) and, as I have said previously,
there is a good deal of slack in the labour market resulting from increased unemployment
and immigration to the UK (low outsider pressures) (Blanchflower, Oswald and Garrett,
1990 & Blanchflower et al. 2007).

Wage settlements themselves have limited representativeness given that only 16.6% of private sector
employees are union members (Grainger and Crowther, 2007) http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file39006.pdf

8

I have some sense from my regional visits that the fear of unemployment among workers
is elevated, although, there is limited data on the issue (see Blanchflower, 1991 and
Campbell et al, 2007). Workers these days seem increasingly aware that they can be
replaced by immigrants and/or that their employer can move his or her production facility
abroad. This limits workers’ bargaining power. These pressures manifest themselves in
the recent low settlements figures.
Lower wage inflation and higher unemployment are usually thought of as describing the
Phillips curve. However, the time series results do not provide universal support for the
theory. The results of estimated Phillips curve relationships appear to be time-specific,
data-specific and/or country-specific. Chart 7 shows the standard relationship for the
UK. There is evidence of a downward-sloping curve at points during the 1970s and
1980s, but since the 1990s the curve has been flat. In other words, for the past 15 or so
years there has been no trade-off between inflation and unemployment – we have had our
cake and eaten it. The Phillips curve does not exist in the UK data, and doesn’t appear to
hold in many other countries.
In contrast, the wage curve describes an inverse relationship between the wage rate and
the local unemployment rate, where the causality runs from the amount of joblessness to
the level of wages. The wage curve is derived from micro-data and is concerned with
aggregation and missing variable biases. It is very much in the tradition of the economics
of walking about.
The wage curve is stable across time and countries or regions – the wage curve seems
universally described as
ln wt = lnwt-1 - 0.1 ln Ut + other terms,
where ln w is the log of the real wage, ln U is the log of the unemployment rate in the
worker’s area, and the other terms control for characteristics of the worker (and t is time,
usually years). The equation tells us that the unemployment elasticity of pay is -0.1. A
doubling of unemployment is then associated with a drop in real wages of 10%. The
wages of the workers in the smallest, usually non-union workplaces who are excluded
from the main wage surveys have a much larger wage-unemployment elasticity of around
-.20.
There is no evidence that measures of labour supply enter wage equations (Bartik, 2000).
The wage curve is not a supply curve but replaces it (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994a,
p.12). As Woodford (1992, p.396) notes, this ‘surrogate labor supply curve lies to the left
of and is flatter than the true Marshallian labor supply curve’.
Wage curves of this general form have been found in random samples of individuals and
establishments in over 40 countries. Sanz-De-Galdeano and Turunen (2007) find a euro
area wage curve over the period 1994-2001. A recent example for the UK is by Bell,
Nickell and Quintini (2002) who use data from the New Earnings Survey for the period
1976-1997 and reject a Phillips curve in favour of a wage curve. Their main findings are

In all cases controls include region

Men
ln waget = .730lnwaget-1 - .034lnUt
Women
ln waget = .679lnwaget-1 - .030lnUt
Solving out the long-run unemployment elasticities for men gives -.126 and for women .093.
The wage curve appears to be an empirical regularity or law, as confirmed by Nijkamp
and Poot (2005) in a recent meta-analysis on a sample of 208 wage/unemployment wage
curve elasticities from the literature. They conclude that
"the wage curve is a robust empirical phenomenon … but there is …
evidence of publication bias. There is indeed an uncorrected mean estimate
of about -0.1 for the elasticity. After controlling for publication bias by
means of two different methods, we estimate that the 'true' wage curve
elasticity at the means of study characteristics is about -0.07".
So why do we find evidence of wage curves, but not Phillips curves? Margo (1993) cites
two principal reasons related to the use of microeconomic versus macroeconomic data,
the former being typically used for the estimation of wage curves and the latter for
Phillips curves. First, less-aggregated data provide many more degrees of freedom than
a decade or so of time series data. And second, he suggests that work at a lower level of
aggregation can reveal aspects of human behaviour that lie hidden in the aggregate time
series. A number of authors, including myself, have attempted to model the Phillips
curve using micro data, controlling for country/region and time fixed effects. When we
do, we find that the autoregressive nature of the macroeconomic theory tends to disappear
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005). These two factors suggest that much macroeconomic
data is suspect as it suffers from aggregation biases of uncertain sign and magnitude.
Except in isolated specifications, there is not persuasive support for a simple Phillips
curve. It seems more sensible to view the data as being characterized by dynamic
fluctuations around a long-run stable wage curve.
5) Money supply and inflation
Milton Friedman (1971) famously stated that ‘Inflation is always and everywhere a
monetary phenomenon’. His view, grounded in the Quantity Theory of Money, is that
increases in the money supply directly give rise to inflation. This theoretical observation
has led some market commentators to question the Bank’s interest rate decisions given
that M4 has been growing at an annual rate of over 10% since 2005. Have we been
ignoring the story being told by monetary aggregates? The short answer is no. The
7

longer answer requires a bit of background information on the controversial relationship
between money growth and inflation.
Chart 8 shows that there is a reasonably strong correlation between the growth of broad
money and inflation (CPI) over the long run in the UK. However, in the short run the
correlation is much less clear. As indicated in the table below, for the period 1875-2006,
the contemporaneous correlation coefficient was 0.7; breaking down these series into the
periods before and after 1972 shows that the correlation remains quite strong. However, if
one looks at the data for 1992-2006, it becomes clear that in the shorter term, the
correlation weakens, indeed the correlation coefficient for this period is just 0.3.

The weakening of the correlation in recent years has arisen because of fast rates of money
growth alongside remarkably stable and low inflation. So what are the explanations for
this outcome? Part of the explanation is certainly the recent growth in financial
innovation, in other words the proliferation of instruments which act as substitutes for
traditional means of exchange. Furthermore, with increased liberalisation of capital
markets and the associated free movement of money, the link between domestic monetary
aggregates and the real economy has become weaker.
As a result of these issues, it is has become increasingly rare for central banks to assign a
prominent role to money in their monetary policy strategies. In the US, the ex-Governor
of the Federal Reserve, Larry Meyer, noted back in 2001 that: “Money plays no explicit
role in today’s consensus macro model, and it plays virtually no role in the conduct of
monetary policy”. Significantly, in March 2006, the Federal Reserve ceased publication
of the M3 monetary aggregate.
One notable exception to this trend is the European Central Bank, but some would argue
that this is simply a legacy of its (successful) attempts to import the credibility of the
money-targeting Bundesbank. In an important recent paper, with particular focus on the
ECB’s strategy, Michael Woodford examines a number of leading arguments in favour of
assigning an important role to monetary aggregates; he concludes that “…none of these
considerations provide a compelling reason to assign a prominent role to monetary
aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy” (Woodford, 2006).
The changes I have mentioned make it difficult to distinguish between supply and
demand shocks to money stocks. The days when monetary policy could be conducted
using a weather vane are long since passed!8 However, we know that in advanced
8

In the Court room of the Bank there is a dial linked to a weather vane on the roof of the building. This was
installed in the early 19th century to serve as a highly effective, if primitive tool of monetary policy. An
easterly wind would allow ships to sail into London, bringing their goods and resulting in a demand shock.

economies characterised by financial innovation, money stock movements tend to be
dominated by money demand shocks rather than money supply shocks.
Looking more closely at the recent UK data, it is clear that the pickup in M4 growth over
the past two years has largely been driven by rapid increases in the deposits held by nonbank financial companies (known as Other Financial Corporations or OFCs). As Chart 9
shows, this sector is made up of many different businesses, which are likely to use their
money holdings in different ways.

Consequently, it is difficult to interpret the likely implications for inflation of the increase
in M4 holdings by OFCs. While one could speculate that institutional investors (such as
pension funds) and securities dealers could use their increased holdings to purchase other
financial or real assets, with inflationary implications, equally the increase could simply
reflect a structural or portfolio shift in demand, in which case the inflationary
implications would be limited. This difficulty in interpretation is exacerbated in that
much of the increase has been from ‘Other Financial Intermediaries’. The demand for
money by these companies, ranging from housing credit corporations to special purpose
vehicles is not well understood. However, most economists believe that the current rapid
rise in money in the economy is really the result of changes in the demand for money,
which is consistent with the stable inflation experienced in recent years.
Despite the fact that the money supply is not targeted by the Bank, it is a variable that
will continue to be monitored and analysed. Not only does money growth and its impact
on liquidity contain important information about future economic developments, it can
also play an important role in shaping inflation expectations.
Conclusion
Over the course of the past hour I’ve shown you a number of areas of research that I’ve
been working on to investigate recent developments in the UK economy. In some cases
the results I have obtained have been surprising, and not necessarily in line with what
theory would tell us.
We saw that there has been an increase in employment over the past couple of years,
driven by an increase in self employment. At the same time, there has been a strong
increase in inactivity – mostly discouraged workers unable to find work as the labour
To accommodate this shock, the Bank would increase notes and coins in circulation. The increase in money
supply would only cause inflation if it wasn’t warranted by an increase in demand.

market has loosened – and unemployment, particularly among those under the age of 24.
It is hard to reconcile this with survey evidence that seems to indicate capacity shortages,
and increased labour productivity which suggests firms have been working their
workforce and capital more intensively.
The rapid rise in self-employment has also been something of a mystery; it has arisen
partly on account of immigration, partly through moves to self-employment from some
older workers who had previously been inactive, and possibly partly a result of rising
house prices, which have loosened capital constraints. However, we have found no
evidence that the commonly-held reasons for people to turn to self employment – changes
in regulation, tax changes, or changes in the minimum wage – have been significant. And
despite the claims of the doomsayers, wages remain benign, which as far as I am
concerned is to be expected, consistent with the loose labour market and increased selfemployment.
On the last topic of my research, the relationship between money supply and inflation,
we’ve clearly seen the importance of walking around; the relationship appears to have
broken down in recent years, but in the context of financial innovation and capital market
liberalisation, we understand why this might be so. As for whether this is important for
monetary policy, we have to form our own judgements based on the data.
I hope this has shown you the importance of ‘sniffing the air’, and putting the data before
the theory where this seems warranted. This is of particular relevance in my role as a
member of the MPC, where rate setting decisions must be made on the basis of a wide
variety of data, both quantitative and qualitative, and even small developments can have
significant implications – such developments have particularly influenced my voting
decisions over the past few months. The rationale for my decision to vote for a rate rise
this month was to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored, given rising food
prices, recent further increases in oil prices, more robust world growth, and the March
inflation outturn.
As you can see, I owe a lot to Bernard Corry. He was a big influence on me, and on the
way I conduct my research. And although he first opened my eyes to the importance of
the man on the Clapham Omnibus, perhaps more importantly he revealed to me the
importance of a more basic form of transport – Walking About.
