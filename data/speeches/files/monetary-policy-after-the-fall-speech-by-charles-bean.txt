Abstract
This paper draws some lessons from the crisis for the future conduct of monetary policy.
(1) We argue that while relatively low policy rates compared to past experience contributed
to the growth in credit and the rise in house prices in the run-up to the crisis, they played only
a modest direct role. But the reduction in volatility associated with the Great Moderation,
some of which is likely to have been down to improved policy making, also appears to have
had an effect. (2) Central banks have deployed a range of unorthodox policies during the
crisis. Those that support particular markets, sectors or firms have no place in normal times.
Asset purchases designed to lower longer-term yields and boost asset prices more generally
appear to have had some success but a short-term interest rate policy instrument represents a
preferable monetary instrument in normal times. (3) The case for raising target inflation rates
is unpersuasive, while the gains from moving to price-level targeting appear likely to be
modest. (4) The case for “leaning against the wind” by raising policy rates higher than
required to meet immediate inflation and output objectives appears strengthened by recent
events, but the collateral damage to output from a policy that is sufficiently aggressive to
make enough of a difference to credit conditions and asset prices is likely to be quite high.
Development and deployment of a macro-prudential policy toolkit focussed more directly on
the underlying source of the exuberance looks a more promising way forward.

Introduction: The Consensus before the Crisis

The Great Financial Crisis that began in August 2007 and the associated Great Contraction in
global economic activity that took place after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September
2008 have presented central bankers and finance ministers in the advanced economies with
one of the toughest challenges that they are ever likely to face. While no-one can claim to
have done it perfectly, by dint of aggressive, and in many cases innovative, policy actions
they have collectively succeeded in preventing the collapse of financial markets, arresting the
contraction in activity and putting their economies on the path to recovery. Even so, the deleveraging process is incomplete, the recovery remains fragile and a considerable margin of
spare capacity is yet to be worked off, while further policy action may yet be necessary to
keep the recovery on track. It may therefore seem premature to draw lessons from the crisis
for the future conduct of monetary policy in normal times. But normal times will surely
return in due course. And it is natural to ask whether the events of the past three years point
to fundamental flaws in our policy frameworks.

The crisis was perhaps all the more remarkable because it occurred after such a long period of
relatively steady growth and low and stable inflation – the Great Moderation. While the
causes of the Great Moderation are open to debate, most policy makers probably put some of
that improved macroeconomic performance down to better policy. That was reflected in a
consensus – at least in the Anglo-Saxon world – as to the ingredients of a successful policy
framework and was mirrored in an equivalent consensus in the academic literature on
monetary policy, synthesising the rigour of dynamic general equilibrium modelling with the
empirical realism of sticky-price Keynesian thinking, best exemplified in the magisterial
contribution of Woodford (2003).

This pre-crisis set of beliefs was reflected in many of the contributions to this annual
conference in the years leading up to the crisis and so might aptly be christened the “Jackson
Hole” consensus; the volume New Challenges for Monetary Policy from the conference that
took place here eleven years ago represents as good a reflection as any of that paradigm.
Broadly speaking, this Jackson Hole consensus consisted of the following ingredients:

3

1. Automatic stabilisers aside, fiscal policy was unsuitable as an instrument of
macroeconomic demand management. That was justified theoretically by appeal to
the comparative advantage of monetary over fiscal policy in controlling nominal
demand or to Ricardian Equivalence or to the argument that fiscal expansions were
harder to reverse than initiate.

2. Monetary policy was therefore assigned the primary role in short-term aggregate
demand management, with policy conducted through the manipulation of a suitable
short-run interest rate.

3. The monetary transmission mechanism operated mainly through longer-term interest
rates, asset prices and expectations of future inflation. Expectations of future policy
rates were central and credibility was key. These channels might be augmented by a
weak credit channel but the banking sector generally was conspicuous by its absence,
particularly in the New Keynesian synthesis models, which also dominated thinking
within central banks. The importance accorded to expectations led naturally to an
increased focus on communication and transparency.

4. The conduct of monetary policy was best delegated to an independent central bank,
free of short-term political considerations. That was buttressed by academic thinking
which drew attention to the potential time inconsistency of optimal policy when
expectations of future policy mattered and which suggested that monetary policy was
best delegated to conservative central bankers with long horizons.

5. Intermediate monetary targets were not useful, because of their unstable link with the
ultimate objectives of policy (though that did not preclude them being helpful at times
as indicators of future demand and inflation). For jurisdictions with floating exchange
rates, monetary policy should instead be focussed on the only thing it could reliably
determine in the long run, namely the price level. In many countries, this was
codified into an explicit numerical inflation target; in others, the objective was left
somewhat fuzzier. Focusing policy on the ultimate objective of price stability, rather
than some intermediate variable, offered a policy framework that was both clearer to
the public and potentially more durable. But the short-run stickiness of wages and

4

prices, coupled with the desirability of avoiding excessive fluctuations in activity,
meant that some “constrained discretion” in the pursuit of price stability was
appropriate; this flexibility was usually incorporated explicitly into central bank
mandates in one way or another.

6. Asset markets were thought to be efficient at distributing and pricing risk and
financial innovations were normally welfare enhancing. While asset prices might be
subject to bouts of “exuberance” on the part of investors, there was little that
monetary policy could do about them. The best monetary policy could was to limit
the fallout when sentiment turned.

7. Systemic financial crises were seen only in history books and emerging markets; they
were unlikely to happen in advanced economies with their developed and wellregulated financial markets. Moreover, price stability and financial stability were
natural bedfellows, the successful achievement of one facilitating the attainment of
the other.

Of course, agreement with each and every element of this consensus was not universal. The
European Central Bank, for instance, continued to place great value on the usefulness of a
monetary pillar. And, as discussed below, there were some who believed that central banks
should also use their constrained discretion to lean against incipient asset-price bubbles and
credit growth. But the set of beliefs above were, we believe, held sufficiently widely in
policy-making and academic circles to be described as a consensus.

In the rest of this paper, we re-visit some aspects of this consensus in the light of the crisis. It
is not possible to cover all the elements of the consensus, though we shall offer some more
wide-ranging observations at the end. In particular, we focus on: whether the experience with
unorthodox policies during the crisis has changed our view of the appropriate policy
instruments in normal times; whether the target rate of inflation should be increased or a shift

5

to price-level targeting is warranted; and what the experience of the crisis has taught us about
how monetary policy should respond to credit/asset-price booms1. As a precursor to that
discussion, however, we ask whether monetary policy decisions contributed materially to the
crisis.

2.

Monetary Policy and the Crisis

It is worth stressing at the outset that a multitude of factors, both microeconomic and
macroeconomic, played into the crisis. A non-exhaustive list of microeconomic factors
includes: the incentive to shift loans off banks’ balance sheets to avoid capital requirements;
the reduced incentive for care in the origination of loans, when those loans are then
securitised; the distorted incentives facing ratings agencies; pay packages encouraging the
pursuit of short-term returns and the adoption of trading positions with the characteristic of a
deeply out-of-the-money option; and the moral hazard arising from financial institutions that
are too big or too systemically important to fail, together with inadequate supervision of the
same. On top of that, the crisis exposed previously unappreciated informational deficiencies
created by the underlying complexity of some asset-backed securities and the high degree of
interconnectedness of financial institutions. Potential macroeconomic factors include the
international payments imbalances, and the side effects of the Great Moderation, as well as
monetary policy. In our view, it would be a mistake to assign a key role to any of these
factors in isolation. On their own, none can surely explain the worst financial crisis in eighty
years. But together they constituted a potent cocktail. Monetary policy makers would
therefore be remiss if they did not re-examine their own decisions in the lead-up to the crisis
and strive to learn the lessons for the future conduct of policy.

In the normal course of events, looser monetary policy boosts asset prices, as lower policy
rates are usually associated with somewhat lower longer-term interest rates too.
Expansionary policy can also be expected to boost activity and profits, which also tends to
raise asset prices. But the case for monetary policy having a role in the run-up to the crisis

1

Some of these themes already figured in the contributions to the conference held here eleven years ago.

6

comes less from these conventional monetary transmission channels and more from the idea
that loose monetary policy particularly encouraged a shift into riskier asset classes, which
then got out of hand – the so-called “risk-taking channel” of monetary policy (Borio and Zhu,
2008).

There are broadly three ways in which looser monetary policy encourages increased risktaking. First, and most conventionally, a lower yield on safe assets encourages substitution
into higher-yielding risky assets, in the process driving up their prices. Second, some
investors such as pension funds need to match the returns on their investments to their
commitments. A reduction in the return on safe assets then encourages them to switch into
high-yielding but riskier assets in an attempt to deliver nominal returns which match their
liabilities – a “search for yield” (Rajan, 2005). Executive compensation linked to absolute
returns has a similar effect.

Finally, a slightly more complex mechanism is developed by Adrian and Shin (2009) and
Adrian, Moench and Shin (2010). They argue that financial intermediaries target leverage
ratios which are either constant (commercial banks) or pro-cyclical (investment banks).
Consequently an increase in the value of a bank’s equity resulting from, say, a rise in the
value of its (risky) assets will lead it to expand its debt (through deposit or wholesale
funding) and a corresponding increase in its assets, either through extending new loans or
acquiring additional securities. So as looser monetary policy boosts asset prices, it
encourages an expansion in banks’ balance sheets, putting further upward pressure on asset
prices. Leverage targets therefore act as an amplification mechanism. But the number of
relatively safe borrowers/projects is limited. So the extension in the volume of loans is also
likely to involve moving along the risk spectrum towards more risky borrowers.

Looser monetary policy is not the only factor operating through these channels. Two other
macroeconomic factors are potentially relevant. First, a number of authors have focussed on
the role of international payments flows in the crisis, with capital flowing “uphill” from
emerging economies, such as China, into the United States and some other advanced
economies (see, for instance, Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2009, and the references therein).
Bernanke (2005) attributes this to a “savings glut” in the surplus countries. Possible drivers
include: an inadequate household safety net and restricted capital market access for

7

enterprises in China; the accumulation of precautionary holdings of international reserves by
emerging economies following the Asia crisis; and rational savings of the windfall gains from
higher oil prices on the part of oil producers. A perceived comparative advantage of the
United States in creating “high quality” financial assets from real investments may also have
played a part (Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas, 2008). This resulted in downward pressure
on the yields on government bonds and other safe assets, and upward pressure on asset prices
generally. Low long-term safe interest rates would also have encouraged the shift into riskier
assets through the risk-taking channel described above.

Second, the lead-up to the crisis was also a long period of steady growth coupled with low
and stable inflation (the Great Moderation)2. Households, businesses and market participants
were consequently faced with a complex signal-extraction problem: how much of this
reduction in economic volatility was permanent? Whereas many economic signal extraction
problems involve learning about the first moments of a distribution, this involves making
inferences about higher moments. The longer such a period of low volatility lasts, the more
reasonable it is to assume that it is permanent. But given the necessary infrequency with
which tail events occur, there may be a natural tendency for people erroneously to conclude
that they could never happen simply because none have materialised recently. Certainly
market measures of uncertainty are consistent with this idea, as measures of volatility implied
from options prices (such as the VIX) suggest that the perceived risks in financial markets
had shrunk to extremely low levels by 2006. This reduction in the perceived riskiness of the
environment is also likely to encourage financial market participants to increase their
holdings of riskier assets and to drive up their prices.

A key piece of evidence suggesting that excessively loose monetary policy might have had a
part to play in generating the preconditions for the crisis is provided by comparisons of policy
rates with the policy settings generated by a benchmark Taylor rule (Taylor, 2007). Chart 1
shows the difference between the policy rate and benchmark estimates of the appropriate
policy rate derived from a Taylor rule for the United States, the euro area and the United
Kingdom. Notwithstanding the usual caveats about the construction of such benchmarks, the
2

Three broad drivers for the Great Moderation have been advanced: structural changes that reduced volatility,
such as enhanced inventory management and easier access to credit; better policy making; and plain good luck
in the form of smaller, or more benign, shocks. As yet, the academic literature has not reached a firm
conclusion as to the relative roles of these factors, in part because of the difficulty in distinguishing the
influences of good luck and better policy.

8

very low level of the Federal Funds rate relative to the Taylor rule from 2001 to 2005 in the
aftermath of the collapse of the dot-com bubble is striking.

Of course, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set its target Federal Funds rate at
unusually low levels for a reason, namely concerns that the United States might find itself
mired in deflation of the sort experienced by Japan during its “Lost Decade”. Bernanke
(2010) provides a vigorous defence of Federal Reserve policy over this period, arguing that
evidence from a comparison of guideline policy rates from conventional Taylor rules with
actual policy rates is unpersuasive. Central banks usually set policy not on the basis of past
inflation but rather their expectations of future inflation, looking through temporary
movements in inflation that result from shocks to commodity prices or indirect tax rates.
During 2002-5, the FOMC judged that prospective underlying (“core”) inflation was
considerably weaker than realised headline inflation, and that the latter would move down
towards the former in the medium term once the temporary effects of one-off disturbances
had passed through. Bernanke finds that merely substituting Greenbook inflation forecasts
for actual inflation in an otherwise standard Taylor rule eliminates much of the discrepancy
with the target Federal Funds rate.

That, of course, still leaves open the possibility that the FOMC’s fears that inflation would
turn out too low were, at least with hindsight, exaggerated. Whether or not policy was
appropriate ex ante will always be difficult to answer because we do not know what would
have happened under a different policy path. One can, however, answer a slightly different
and more straightforward question, namely what impact the accommodative policy stance
had on asset prices and credit growth. Bernanke goes on to provide time-series and crosscountry evidence, which suggests that monetary policy played a relatively modest role in the
boom in house prices in the United States and a number of other countries.

Chart 1 shows that both UK and euro-area policy rates were less noticeably out of line with
their respective Taylor benchmarks. That too is striking. Indeed, in the United Kingdom,
they were actually above the benchmark for much of the relevant period, even though the
United Kingdom saw one of the larger run-ups in debt and house prices during this period.
And, in the euro area, countries such as Spain experienced substantial house price booms,
while countries such as Germany did not. That need not imply that monetary policy was

9

innocent in the run-up to the crisis, as the equilibrium real interest rate could have been
higher in the United Kingdom than in the calibrated Taylor rule. And differences in
equilibrium real interest rates across countries can in principle explain the heterogeneity in
the euro area. But this is hardly compelling evidence for assigning the central role to
monetary policy, suggesting that other factors were more important.

To complement Bernanke’s analysis, we provide some further evidence on the impact of
policy on credit and asset prices, obtained from estimated vector auto-regressions for the
United States and the United Kingdom. The model includes the standard macroeconomic
variables appearing in New Keynesian descriptions of monetary policy: real GDP growth,
CPI inflation and a short-term nominal interest rate. In addition, the model also includes a set
of variables relating to credit and asset prices: total credit growth; the spread of investmentgrade corporate bonds over government bonds, as a general indicator of credit spreads; and
house price inflation. To capture the potential impact of the Great Moderation on perceptions
of the riskiness of the environment, we also include a measure of macroeconomic volatility.
This is generated from an auxiliary factor stochastic-volatility model, which estimates the
common time-varying volatility in a set of key macroeconomic variables (GDP,
consumption, investment, exports, imports and inflation). The resulting series are shown in
Chart 2, together with estimated one standard deviation confidence intervals, and have the
characteristics that one would expect: high in the Seventies and early Eighties, then falling
back as the period of the Great Moderation wears on, and rising sharply with the onset of the
financial crisis and the Great Contraction.

We envisage a set of seven underlying fundamental shocks driving these seven variables: an
aggregate demand shock; an aggregate supply shock; a monetary policy shock; a
macroeconomic volatility shock; a credit demand shock; a credit supply shock; and a house
price shock. The first three of these are conventional in nature. The fourth captures changes
in the riskiness of the macroeconomic environment. The credit demand and credit supply
shocks are intended to capture movements in credit resulting from other factors, while the
house price shock captures movements in house prices attributable to factors not elsewhere
accounted for. Other factors driving both credit and house prices will include the low level of
long-term real interest rates and associated international current account imbalances.

10

The identification scheme employs a combination of ordering assumptions and theoretical
sign restrictions on the impulse responses (see Uhlig, 2005). Macroeconomic volatility
should be a slowly moving variable that is little affected by contemporaneous developments
in the economy. One would expect that most of the variance in macroeconomic volatility – a
second moment – is not well explained by the other shocks; that is borne out in the results,
especially for the United Kingdom. Macroeconomic volatility is therefore assumed to be
contemporaneously unaffected by any of the other shocks. The aggregate demand/supply
block comes next, affecting credit and housing markets and monetary policy
contemporaneously, but not being affected by contemporaneous developments in them; an
aggregate demand shock affects inflation and growth in the same direction, while an
aggregate supply shock drives them in different directions. That is followed by the credit
market block: again, a credit demand shock drives credit growth and the bond spread in the
same direction, while a credit supply shock drives them in different directions. Then comes
monetary policy; policy makers are therefore assumed to be able to react to movements in the
real economy and in credit markets within the quarter, which does not seem unreasonable.
House prices come last.

For the United States, the variables in the vector auto-regression are: CPI inflation; GDP
growth; the effective Federal Funds rate; the difference between the Merrill Lynch corporate
BAA and 10-year Treasury yields; the growth in total private credit market debt outstanding
deflated by CPI; the rate of change of house prices (the National Association of Realtors
existing homes price index to 1975 linked to the Federal Housing Finance Agency thereafter)
deflated by CPI; and the macroeconomic volatility index. For the United Kingdom, the
equivalent variables are: CPI inflation; GDP growth; Bank Rate; the difference between the
investment-grade corporate bond and 10-year government bond yields; the growth in M4
lending (excluding securitisations and loans to intermediate OFCs) deflated by CPI; the rate
of change of house prices (the Nationwide house price index to 1983 linked to the Halifax
measure thereafter) deflated by CPI; and the macroeconomic volatility index. The data are
quarterly, there are two lags of each variable, and the sample runs from 1966 Q3 to 2010 Q1.
A good case can be made for employing only more recent data, on the grounds that monetary

11

policy reaction functions have evolved during this time. But the cost of that is reduced
precision and estimates over just the latter part of the period turn out to be rather less well
defined. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods to facilitate imposition of the sign
restrictions and the construction of confidence intervals on convolutions of the parameters.

The impulse responses are shown as four-quarter growth rates in Charts 3a (United States)
and 3b (United Kingdom), where the dark blue lines are the posterior median responses and
the blue swathes provide one standard deviation confidence intervals. For the most part these
look sensible, though, as is usually the case in such exercises, there are one or two responses
that look a little odd. In particular, both sets of estimates exhibit the oft-observed “price
puzzle”, whereby the immediate impact of a monetary policy tightening is to increase, rather
than decrease, the rate of inflation. A number of explanations for this price puzzle have been
advanced in the literature, including the reaction of the monetary policy maker to information
on inflation prospects not incorporated in the model, and a monetary policy reaction function
that is insufficiently sensitive to inflation over part of the sample period. Because of the
presence of the price puzzle, we do not to focus on the behaviour of inflation in the
simulations reported below.

Aside from the initially perverse inflation response, the impact of an unexpected monetary
tightening is as one would expect, in both the United States and the United Kingdom: output
growth falls, the bond spread rises, real credit growth falls and real house price inflation falls.
The impact of an increase in macroeconomic volatility (i.e. an increase in general riskiness) is
also worth highlighting: output growth falls, credit spreads rise, real credit growth falls, and
real house price inflation falls. This is all as one would expect from the discussion above
regarding the risk-taking channel. In both countries, inflation also rises when macroeconomic
volatility increases.

Charts 4a and 4b show historical decompositions derived using the posterior means of the
distribution of the coefficient estimates. As there is rather a lot of information to digest in
these decompositions, we show just the main variables of interest: the policy rate, and the
four-quarter growth rates of output, real credit and real house prices. We also combine the

12

impact of the aggregate demand and supply shocks into a single composite factor, and do the
same with the credit demand and credit supply shocks so as to focus more clearly on the
impact of monetary policy and macroeconomic volatility. There are a number of points to be
made.

First, monetary policy (the green bars) during the 2002-5 period is loose relative to the
estimated historical reaction function not only in the United States – as might be expected
given the evidence from Chart 1 – but also, more surprisingly, in the United Kingdom. In the
United States, the Federal Funds rate is, on average, 1.5 percentage points below the rate that
would have obtained if the estimated reaction function had applied. In the United Kingdom,
the corresponding figure is 2.1 percentage points. There is, however, a simple explanation for
the apparent looseness relative to the estimated reaction function in the United Kingdom,
namely the change in the policy regime associated with the adoption of inflation targeting and
the subsequent credibility gain from giving operational responsibility for monetary policy to
the Bank of England. This represented a sharp change in regime after a somewhat chequered
history of inflation control and probably contributed to a lower equilibrium real policy rate
because of the associated reduction in the inflation risk premium.

Second, those monetary policy deviations can explain only part of the excess credit growth
and house price inflation in the two countries over 2002-5. In the United States, the monetary
policy shocks are associated with, on average, an extra 0.6 percentage points on annual real
credit growth and an extra 1.5 percentage points on annual real house price inflation. That is
to be compared with average actual annual real credit growth over the period of 5.6 per cent
and average annual real house price inflation of 5.8 per cent. For the United Kingdom, the
corresponding figures are an average 1.3 percentage points on annual real credit growth and
6.0 percentage points on annual real house price inflation, compared with average annual real
actual credit growth of 8.9 per cent and average annual real house price inflation of 13.0 per
cent. In both countries, an important driver of house price inflation over the period is house
price shocks, though a wider range of influences appear to have been involved in driving the
expansion in credit. The moral from these results would appear to be that although monetary
policy may have played a role in fuelling the credit/house-price boom that preceded the crisis,
it is rather more Rosencrantz than Hamlet. We return in Section 5 to the question of whether
these findings suggest that policy should be set differently in future.

13

The third point of note is the significant role played by shocks to macroeconomic volatility
(blue bars), particularly in regard to credit growth, with noticeably more rapid expansion in
credit taking place during tranquil periods. In particular, over the period 2002-5,
macroeconomic volatility accounts for, on average, an extra 0.7 percentage points on US
annual real credit growth and 0.5 percentage points on US annual real house price growth. In
the United Kingdom, the corresponding effects are even larger: 2.1 percentage points on
annual real credit growth and 2.0 percentage points on annual real house price inflation. A
reduction in volatility also confers a sizeable “growth dividend”, suggesting that the stability
of the Great Moderation period boosted the sustainable rate of growth, while the current
period of high volatility has had the opposite effect; that is consistent with the cross-country
evidence of Ramey and Ramey (1995), who find that higher volatility tends to be associated
with lower growth.

The idea that periods of economic stability encourage exuberance in credit markets, thus
sowing the seeds of their own destruction, is a key part of Minsky’s theory of recurring
financial crises (see e.g. Minsky, 1982). The results here provide some empirical evidence
for such a dynamic process. Moreover, to the extent that better policy accounted for the
Great Moderation, it provides a second, indirect, channel whereby policy may have
contributed to creating the conditions conducive to a subsequent financial bust. But it would
clearly be a mistake to conclude that policy should aim to induce fluctuations in the macroeconomy in order to prevent financial market participants becoming too confident about the
outlook! The right moral is surely that policy makers need to be most vocal about the risks to
the outlook when things appear to be going well, and to take appropriate restraining action if
needed.

The Instruments of Monetary Policy

Dealing with the fallout from the banking crisis has pushed central banks in the affected
jurisdictions into uncharted waters. The top panel of Table 1 summarizes the wide variety of
measures adopted by some of the major central banks, while Chart 5 illustrates the associated
expansion in the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the
Bank of England.

14

The most immediate response was to offer liquidity support to the banking sector, especially
as the crisis intensified in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of
American International Group. Measures adopted included widening access to Discount
Window Facilities, expanding the range of eligible collateral and counterparties, extending
loan tenors and introducing foreign currency swap lines. As the lending in these operations is
normally over-collateralised, there is essentially negligible credit risk to the central bank.
In addition to these classical, if somewhat expanded, central banking support operations, a
number of central banks – most especially the Federal Reserve, but also the European Central
Bank and the Bank of England – undertook less conventional actions aimed at improving the
operation of particular, temporarily dysfunctional, markets. For instance, the Federal Reserve
and the Bank of England both bought high-quality Commercial Paper, reducing the risk that a
borrower could not raise new funds to repay maturing paper and thus also encouraging
private investors to lend. This exposes the central bank to some credit risk3, but the short
tenor and restriction to high-quality companies makes the risk slight.

The Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) represented a
rather more radical departure. Under the TALF, the Federal Reserve made medium-term
loans to investors against highly-rated securities backed by consumer and business debt, with
the aim of increasing the availability of consumer and business credit. Even though there is a
haircut on the securities, the credit risk to the central bank is potentially higher under this
programme; that risk was effectively underwritten through the provision of credit protection
by the US Treasury.

Many of these extraordinary actions were designed to be self-liquidating as conditions
normalise: central bank or government support becomes more expensive than market finance,
or else is specifically time-limited. A central bank should not offer special support to
particular private institutions or markets indefinitely, unless it is seeking to offset an
identifiable market failure. Otherwise, it just ends up distorting the market structure.
Moreover, to the extent that there is a market failure or distortion present, in the first instance
it is surely the job of government, rather than the central bank, to address that market failure.
In addition, anything that involves the central bank favouring particular businesses or sectors

Though in any case, the Bank of England’s asset purchases are indemnified against loss by HM Treasury.

15

of the economy or exposing the consolidated public sector balance sheet to credit risk takes it
into territory that is inherently political and risks inviting political intervention or limitations
to its independence.

While there should be little need for extraordinary liquidity and credit support once normal
times return, there are potential lessons from the crisis for the execution of conventional
monetary policy. Before the crisis, and with policy rates averaging somewhere in the 4-5 per
cent range, central bankers generally believed they had plenty of room for manoeuvre to
offset all but the most severe adverse demand shocks. But the sharp increases in a range of
credit spreads from the onset of the crisis in August 2007, and especially after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in the Autumn of 2008, meant that policy rates had to fall sharply merely to
maintain the pre-existing levels of key borrowing rates4, let alone lowering them in order to
stimulate aggregate demand to counteract the substantial contraction over 2008 Q4 and 2009
Q1. As a result, many monetary policymakers soon found themselves with policy rates at, or
near, the zero interest rate lower bound (ZLB) and were forced to turn to other means to
inject further monetary stimulus.
There are two5 main options facing a central bank when it nears the ZLB, both of which seek
to depress longer-term interest rates and raise asset prices: committing to keep future policy
rates low; and reducing the spreads of longer-term interest rates over expected policy rates
through asset purchases financed by money creation.

In the canonical New Keynesian/New Classical DSGE model, being able to commit to keep
policy rates low for a sustained period is the only way of further stimulating the economy at
the ZLB, as the impact of monetary policy is completely summarised by the current and
future path of the policy rate. But keeping interest rates low in the future will boost future
inflation, thus raising expected inflation and boosting activity today. The problem is that the
central bank lacks the incentive to stick to this strategy once economic conditions have
improved and the ZLB episode is past, i.e. the policy is time inconsistent. So the central bank

4

Taylor (2008) advocates the use of a “spread-adjusted” Taylor Rule to set the policy rate in such
circumstances. Cúrdia and Woodford (2009) develop a simple model in which credit frictions generate a spread
on the interest rate between savers and borrowers. The optimal monetary response to a rise in credit spreads in
their model strictly involves a less-than-full compensatory reduction in the policy rate, but is likely to be close to
Taylor’s recommendation for reasonable calibrations of the interest-elasticities of saving and borrowing.
5
Buiter and Panigirtzoglou (2001) also discuss other, more exotic, approaches.

16

needs to have some way of making credible a commitment to what will subsequently seem
like future irresponsibility; words alone will not suffice, unless reneging on those words
carries a significant reputational cost. It is important to distinguish this policy strategy from
simply communicating that policy rates are likely to stay low because output and inflation are
expected to stay low. That may help to align expectations with the views of the policy maker
and be valuable in aiding transparency, but does not represent the pursuit of a policy strategy
under commitment.

As noted above, the earlier deflation scare, following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, had
already persuaded the FOMC not only to keep the target Federal Funds rate at an especially
low level, but also first to indicate that it would remain low for an “extended period” and then
to indicate that the monetary stimulus would be withdrawn at only a “measured” pace. This
has something of the character of attempting to reap the benefits of being able to commit in
the future by sticking to past promises.

During the current ZLB episode, the FOMC has again explicitly indicated that it expects
monetary policy to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal Funds rate “for an
extended period”. The Bank of Canada and the Riksbank have also made statements that
imply they expect policy rates to remain low for a period, though given the nature and
relatively short time horizon of those statements, it is a moot point whether these are best
thought of as exercises in commitment or exercises in transparency.

The second option at the ZLB involves the outright purchases of longer-dated assets,
particularly government bonds, financed by the issuance of extra central bank reserves. Such
purchases aim to raise the prices of the purchased assets, together with those of a whole range
of assets that are imperfect substitutes as the sellers subsequently re-balance their portfolios.
This imperfect asset substitutability may be both time-varying – in particular, the scope for
asset substitution may be rather greater in the long run than in the short run – and statecontingent, as traders may be less able to arbitrage between assets in times of economic and
financial distress. But as long as there is some period of imperfect asset substitutability to
exploit, purchases by the central bank can push up asset values, which in turn boosts
aggregate demand and encourages increased issuance of the assets whose prices have risen.

17

This rationale for asset purchases – that relative asset supplies affect asset prices and returns
–dates back to Tobin (1969) and Brunner and Meltzer (1972). The mechanism is, however,
absent from the canonical New Keynesian/New Classical macroeconomic model. That is
because of a property akin to Ricardian equivalence: private agents internalise the budgetary
implications of the public sector’s asset acquisitions, so that any change in the risk to which
the private sector is exposed through its asset holdings is exactly offset by a compensating
change in the risk borne by the public sector and thus ultimately the taxpayer through the
public sector budget constraint (Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003). While this is a striking
result, it is relatively easy to think of reasons why it might not hold in practice: any of credit
market imperfections, limited asset-market participation or plain myopia is potentially
sufficient. Indeed in subsequent work (Cúrdia and Woodford, 2010), Woodford himself
explores some of the ways that asset purchases might have traction, while Andrés, LópezSalido and Nelson (2004) provide a particular model that embeds imperfect substitutability
arising from limited participation within a DSGE framework.

Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have bought longer-dated government and
private assets, though with different emphases6. The Federal Reserve has purchased $1.45
trillion (10 per cent of GDP) worth of Government Sponsored Enterprise debt and mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by them. In addition, the Federal Reserve has purchased $300
billion (2 per cent of GDP) worth of US Treasuries. The Bank of England has bought nearly
£200 billion (14 per cent of GDP) of UK government bonds, together with a small quantity of
corporate bonds. The Bank of Japan has also bought around ¥13 trillion (3 per cent of GDP)
of Japanese government bonds since the crisis deepened in late 2008; that is to be compared
with ¥20 trillion of purchases during their 2001-6 quantitative easing period.

It is worth stressing that neither the Federal Reserve nor the Bank of England has assigned a
key role to the expansion of central bank liabilities in the transmission mechanism associated
with these asset purchases. In current circumstances, it is plausible to believe that
commercial banks would be willing to hold the extra claims on the central bank as liquid
assets at, or near, the existing vector of interest rates, rather than lending them on and driving
down loan rates. That is reflected in the fact that the ratio of the monetary liabilities of the
6

The European Central Bank has also bought €60 billion (0.6% of GDP) of covered bonds and the same
quantity of distressed euro-area sovereign debt, though the objective of these interventions has been to underpin
prices and improve liquidity in the selected markets rather than alter monetary conditions.

18

banking system (broad money) to the monetary base has fallen sharply in both countries, as
indeed it did in Japan a decade earlier. In its communications, the Bank of England has
stressed the monetary impact of its asset purchases, but that has been on the quantity of
monetary deposits in the banking system, not narrow money.

Have these policies been effective? Or does Eggertsson and Woodford’s neutrality result
apply? Studies of Japan’s earlier experience of quantitative easing suggested only rather
modest effects. For instance, Bernanke et al. (2004) found that although the falls in
government bond yields following bond purchase announcements were statistically
significant, they were typically just a few basis points in magnitude. Nevertheless, over the
period as a whole, the yield curve was somewhat lower than predicted by a macro-factor
model of the term structure, consistent with some impact from unconventional monetary
policy actions (including also the Bank of Japan’s zero interest rate policy). Oda and Ueda
(2005) estimate bond risk premia using a structural macro-finance model and find that bond
purchases had no significant effect in reducing those risk premia, though they do find that the
zero interest rate policy reduced long-term rates by around 20-40bp. Finally, Shiratsuka
(2009) finds that credit premia across a range of assets fell during the period of quantitative
easing.

From an empirical perspective, the recent US and UK asset purchases offer a particular
advantage – they are vastly bigger in size and took place relatively quickly7. Hence, greater
precision can be expected. For the United Kingdom, an early event study by Meier (2009)
suggests that the Bank of England’s initial £125 billion of gilt purchases reduced longer-term
gilt yields by between 40 and 100 basis points. A more recent and fuller study is provided by
Joyce et al. (2010). They examine the reaction of market prices immediately after each assetpurchase announcement and find that the total impact on gilt yields was to lower them by an
average of about 100 basis points8. Moreover, as the expected path of Bank Rate (from
overnight indexed swaps) was broadly unaffected by the announcements, they conclude that
the primary impact must be through a portfolio re-balancing channel rather than through any

7

There is a substantial related literature attempting to uncover the effects of changes in debt maturity structure
on relative yields. These studies have generally struggled to identify well-defined effects from variations in the
supplies of debt of different maturities. Though the variations in asset quantities may be quite substantial, they
usually take place slowly, necessitating controlling for a wide range of other factors affecting relative yields.
8
By construction, an event study approach can only capture the short-run elasticity of substitution. The medium
to longer terms effects may be somewhat less as further portfolio rebalancing takes place.

19

information that asset-purchase announcements reveal about the likely future path of Bank
Rate. Corporate bond yields also fell, with investment-grade bonds declining 70 basis points
and non-investment grade bonds declining 150 basis points, while the sterling exchange rate
depreciated by about 4 per cent.

For the United States, Gagnon et al. (2010) adopt a similar approach. They find that, across
the relevant set of eight announcements, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasuries and
Agency debt/MBS resulted in total falls of 90 basis points in the 10-year Treasury yield, 160
points in the 10-year agency debt yield and 110 basis points in the agency MBS yield. Baa
corporate bond yields also fell, by a total of 70 basis points. The size of these effects is
broadly comparable to those found for the United Kingdom by Joyce et al. Neely (2010)
provides some further evidence, this time relating to the international impact of the Federal
Reserve’s large scale asset purchases. He finds that yields on Australian, Canadian, German,
Japanese and UK 10-year bonds fell by an average of 45 basis points over the same set of
announcements, while the dollar depreciated by 5 per cent. That points to considerable
international spillovers from such asset purchases.

The bottom line from these studies is the clear indication that asset purchases can be an
effective monetary instrument. But should such unconventional policies also be part of the
regular central bank toolkit in normal times? At first blush, there seems no reason why they
should not. Indeed, policymakers regularly used to attempt to manipulate the yield curve in
the Sixties and Seventies, for instance the Federal Reserve’s “Operation Twist” (though in
that case the impact of the purchases on the money supply was sterilised). But in practice it
probably makes sense to rely on a short interest rate as the primary instrument of monetary
policy for three reasons.

First, while the evidence that asset purchases do have the effect expected on asset prices is
compelling, there is a wealth of evidence regarding the monetary transmission mechanism
from movements in short-term policy rates. Central banks, moreover, have considerable
experience in the operation of policy through short interest rates. Given that the impact of
changes in a short-term policy rate is both more certain and better understood, it makes more
sense to put the most weight on that instrument rather than asset purchases (Brainard, 1967).

20

Second, and related to the above argument concerning the relative uncertainty of a short
interest rate and asset purchases as monetary policy instruments, there are reasons to think
that the efficacy of the latter will be less in normal times. The theoretical case for an effect
from asset purchases rests on there being frictions that prevent the Eggertsson-Woodford
neutrality result holding. During a financial crisis, when credit is hard to come by,
arbitrageurs may find it difficult to find the wherewithal to correct any excessive compression
of the spread between government bond yields and expected policy rates. During normal
times, such credit will be easier to come by and the activities of arbitrageurs may therefore
lead to the attenuation of the effectiveness of asset purchases as a monetary policy tool.

Third, while purchases of government debt may be a suitable last resort at the ZLB, regular
purchases during normal times will be liable to give rise to the suspicion that the central bank
is doing so at the behest of the government in order to lower the cost of budgetary finance,
rather than for monetary policy purposes. In other words, it is intending to monetise the debt
permanently. Aside from giving rise to doubts about the central bank’s independence, it
could also prompt inflation expectations and long-term nominal interest rates to rise. The
communication challenge for a central bank in these circumstances would be formidable. So
asset purchases aimed at flattening the yield curve are probably best kept in the locker
marked For Emergency Use Only.

The Objectives of Monetary Policy: The Inflation Target

Following Japan’s “lost decade”, and given impetus by the deflation scare after the bursting
of the dot-com bubble, a number of studies appeared evaluating the likelihood of other
advanced economies reaching the ZLB. Simulations of macroeconomic models where
monetary policy follows some version of a Taylor rule suggested that an inflation target of 2
per cent would entail relatively frequent episodes of the ZLB acting as a binding constraint
on monetary policy (Reifschneider and Williams 2000; Coenen, Orphanides and Wieland
2004). For example, in simulations with the Federal Reserve Board's macroeconometric
model, Reifschneider and Williams found that the ZLB was reached about 10 per cent of the
time. Nonetheless, these studies suggested that with an inflation target as low as 2 per cent,
the adverse effects of the ZLB on macroeconomic volatility would be relatively modest. That
was because the magnitude and duration of the constraint on policy actions were pretty mild.

21

Only with inflation targets of 1 per cent or less did the ZLB result in noticeably higher
variability of output and inflation. So an inflation target of 2 per cent or so looked to provide
enough room for monetary policy under most circumstances.

With policy rates reaching their effective ZLB in a number of jurisdictions and most of the
central banks concerned having resorted to unorthodox monetary policy measures in order to
inject additional monetary stimulus into their economies, the question naturally arises as to
whether this conclusion still stands. Or should inflation targets be raised to, say, 4 per cent as
suggested by Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), providing another two percentage
points of extra room to cut policy rates before reaching the ZLB?

Some analytical evidence in favour of a higher inflation target comes from Williams (2009).
With the help of the Federal Reserve’s macroeconomic model, he asks what policy the
FOMC (represented as an appropriate Taylor Rule) would have chosen during the Great
Contraction had it not been constrained by the ZLB and what the impact would have been on
output and inflation; he then compares that with the outcomes when the ZLB bites. He finds
that although the ZLB did not materially aggravate the US downturn in 2008 – essentially
because the fall in activity after the collapse of Lehman Brothers was so sharp that, in the
absence of perfect foresight, no monetary policy actions could have impacted fast enough –
the ZLB does appear to have constrained the pace of recovery. In particular, if real policy
rates could have been set around four percentage points lower, the recovery in output would
have been significantly faster and the rise in unemployment mitigated. Abstracting from the
scope for other policies to boost demand, Williams puts the cost to the United States of this
constraint on policy rates at around $1.8 trillion of foregone output over 2009-2012.

Some might be tempted, therefore, to argue that a modest increase in target inflation rates
from the current norm of around 2 per cent is called for. There are, however, potential costs
associated with accepting higher average inflation. First, while the costs from perfectly
anticipated inflation might seem likely to be modest, the academic literature suggests that
may not be the case. Moreover, there is a well documented empirical relationship between
the level and the volatility of inflation, and unexpected movements in inflation are more

22

likely to generate resource misallocation and the capricious redistribution of income and
wealth. There is, therefore, a risk that even a modest increase in the target of a few
percentage points could lead to a corresponding increase in inflation volatility and associated
welfare losses.

Second, unlike in most macroeconomic models, expectations formation is not costless. A
bonus from low and stable inflation is that economic agents do not have to expend much
effort in predicting inflation; the simple heuristic that inflation is a constant – or even that
prices are stable – will suffice (Brazier et al., 2008). That is particularly valuable for
households, who are likely to be relatively less informed. While inflation of 4 per cent may
not sound much higher than 2 per cent, the difference is large enough that people would have
greater need to take account of inflation explicitly in their decision making, especially if it
also becomes more variable.

Third, the case for creating more room to cut policy rates rests on two assumptions: that other
policies to boost aggregate demand are unavailable or inefficient; and that shocks that lead to
the ZLB being a significant constraint are reasonably frequent. As far as the former goes, as
already noted, there is evidence suggesting that unorthodox monetary policies have had some
traction and usually one would also expect that there would be scope to apply a fiscal
stimulus too. But there is clearly less room for manoeuvre if a banking crisis also begets a
fiscal crisis, as often turns out to be the case. Banking crises typically also raise credit
spreads, which cannot be offset by a cut in the nominal policy rate by central banks caught at
the ZLB. The case for raising the inflation target to minimise the risk of these situations
arising depends crucially on how frequently they are expected to occur in the future. To the
extent that the Great Contraction represents a once-in-a-century event and the subsequent
changes in regulation and financial market structure are effective in reducing the likelihood
of a repeat, the case for raising the target rate of inflation will be correspondingly weakened.

Finally, it seems particularly dangerous to raise inflation targets at the current juncture, as one
should expect nominal interest rates to rise roughly in line. Even if expected long-term real
interest rates were thus unchanged, the fall in bond prices would lower wealth and worsen the

23

already-impaired balance sheets of financial institutions. In summary, raising inflation targets
does not seem the most appropriate response to the crisis. It is surely far better to seek ways
of reducing their frequency and impact.

Rather than raising the target rate of inflation, an alternative and theoretically more appealing
approach would be to target the price level rather than the inflation rate. The difference
between inflation and price-level targeting is obviously that, under the former, any
undershoot or overshoot of the price level relative to the path implied by the target is ignored
in subsequent periods, whereas, under the latter, those control errors have to be clawed back,
thus returning the price level to its originally expected path. Consequently the price level
should revert to its trend under price-level targeting, whereas it will be difference-stationary
under inflation targeting.

In the standard New Keynesian macroeconomic model with sticky prices and forwardlooking agents, the optimal policy under commitment delivers such a trend-stationary price
level, even though welfare only depends on the inflation rate. That is because it provides the
necessary history-dependence in policy to ensure that the policymaker goes through with
promises that are otherwise time inconsistent; see, for instance, Svensson (1999). Indeed, a
price-level target may be an effective way of implementing the fully optimal monetary policy
under commitment (Vestin, 2006). A considerable body of research expands on this idea; see
e.g. Ambler (2009) and the references therein.

Why might price-level targeting generate less variability of inflation and output than an
inflation target, as it is tempting to think the opposite should be the case? Under price-level
targeting, an adverse shock to demand, which pushes the price level below its target path,
necessarily requires higher inflation in the future in order to return the price level to its target
path. Assuming that private agents understand this, expected real interest rates fall, so
boosting demand today. Inflation expectations therefore act as a more effective automatic
stabilizer than they do under inflation targeting. By the same token, an adverse supply
(mark-up) shock, which raises the price level above its target path and depresses output
today, leads to lower expected future inflation. But, in the standard New Keynesian Phillips
curve describing pricing behaviour, inflation is positively related to expected future inflation.

24

Hence the lower expected future inflation acts to offset the impact of the supply shock by
moderating the rise in today’s price level.

A corollary of inflation expectations becoming an automatic stabiliser under price-level
targeting is that it reduces the extent to which the nominal policy rate needs to fall to offset an
adverse demand shock. So a price-level targeting regime which specifies that prices should
grow at x per cent a year ought to lead to fewer instances in which the ZLB on interest rates
bites than does an inflation targeting regime with a target rate of x per cent. This proposition
is demonstrated formally by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).

It is, though, worth pointing out that there may be times when having a price-level target is
likely to be unhelpful. For instance, consider the present case of the United Kingdom, where
upward shocks to oil prices and indirect taxes and a substantial depreciation of sterling have
led to inflation running consistently above the 2 per cent target, but at a time when the
economy has also been subject to an adverse demand shock which has opened up a
substantial margin of spare capacity. Price-level targeting would dictate that this excess
inflation must subsequently be unwound. Consequently, inflation expectations would be
lower and real interest rates higher. That in turn would exacerbate the downward pressure on
demand, worsening the constraint of the ZLB.

The theoretical superiority of price-level targets over inflation targets hinges on the forwardlooking nature of expectations. If expectations are not forward-looking, then their automatic
stabilising feature is lost. And the presence of inertia in the inflation process also reduces the
relative superiority of price-level targets. In particular, if a significant fraction of firms set
their prices on the basis of past inflation, then it becomes optimal to permit some drift in the
price-level path in response to shocks. That is because those firms that are able to will raise
their price in response to a shock that raises the overall price level relative to target. If the
central bank subsequently seeks to bring the overall price level back on to the originally
prescribed path, then the relative price of those firms will be too high. It is better instead to
allow some base drift in order to reduce the average (squared) distortion in relative prices
across the economy as a whole. That suggests that some hybrid of price-level and inflation
targeting may be a good idea; targeting average inflation over a run of years is one way to
approximate such a hybrid regime (King, 1999).

25

A final issue with price-level targeting lies in communications. While the public can
probably relate to the idea of inflation as the average rate at which prices in the economy are
changing, it less clear that they will understand what a consumer price level index means.
Such a target for the price-level would therefore probably need to be portrayed as stabilising
average inflation over a very long period.

The extent to which a shift to targeting the price-level, rather than inflation, acts as a bulwark
against the ZLB is ultimately an empirical issue. Interestingly, however, the behaviour of the
price level in many advanced economies during the Great Moderation suggests that it might
not make a lot of difference whether or not countries move to targeting a path for prices
rather than inflation. As already noted, the price level under an inflation targeting regime in
which control errors are bygones should exhibit a unit root, whereas under price-level
targeting it should be trend stationary. And the data suggest that outturns have in many cases
resembled what we would expect to see under trend, rather than difference, stationarity9.

This can be seen for eight jurisdictions in Charts 6a (euro area, Japan, United Kingdom and
United States) and Chart 6b (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden – four prominent
smaller inflation targeting countries). These plot the deviation of the relevant measure of
consumer price inflation from a fixed trend line that grows at the target rate of inflation. For
inflation-targeting central banks that is either given by their stated target or else the mid-point
of their target range; the data are shown since their adoption of an inflation target. The ECB
does not regard itself as formally having an inflation target, but nevertheless has a price
stability goal of “close to, but a little below” 2 per cent; we therefore set the price-level trend
to grow at 1.9 per cent a year. Finally neither Japan nor the United States have an explicit
statement of their inflation objective. For Japan, we assume a target inflation rate of 0.1 per
cent a year; that is a little higher than the within-sample trend but consistent with the idea that
the Bank of Japan was aiming for a positive rate of inflation. For the United States, we
assume a target inflation rate of 2.5 per cent, which is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s
mandate to maintain price stability and is close to the average inflation rate within the
sample.

9

I am grateful to Lars Svensson for drawing my attention to this fact.

26

What is striking about these series is that, for the most part, they look more like trendstationary series than difference-stationary ones, with swings around a flattish line. The three
exceptions are: Japan, which is not altogether surprising given that is was mired in deflation
for much of the period; New Zealand, where inflation has systematically averaged above the
mid-point of the target range; and Sweden, where the opposite is true. But for both New
Zealand and Sweden, the behaviour is still more characteristic of trend stationarity than
difference stationarity.

Table 2 reports some formal (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) statistical tests of difference
stationarity for these eight jurisdictions over the period 1993 Q4 to 2010 Q1 (excluding the
euro area, where the tests run from the inception of the euro). The dependent variable is the
change in the deviation of (the logarithm of) the target measure of prices from a path along
which the price level grows at a rate corresponding to the central bank’s inflation objective.
The regressors include a constant, a trend10, two lagged values of the dependant variable and
the lagged level of the variable of interest, which should attract a zero coefficient if and only
if the series is stationary in differences.

In all eight jurisdictions, the coefficient on the lagged level (δ) is numerically quite large, and
especially so in the case of the euro area. None, though, are statistically significant at
conventional levels. The tests are, however, likely to be of low power on such short samples.
In order to increase the power of the test, the final row of the Table therefore shows the result
when of a pooled regression, with the coefficient δ constrained to be the same across
countries (the other coefficients are allowed to differ); the euro area is omitted from this
regression in order to create a balanced panel. Unsurprisingly, the coefficient δ is close to its
average across the individual country regressions. But the appropriately adjusted test statistic
(see Levin, Lin and Chu, 2002) on δ is now highly statistically significant, strongly
suggesting that collectively the price-level series are trend-, rather than difference-,
stationary.

10

To cater for drift insofar as prices have not, on average, risen at the supposed target rate.

27

There are a number of possible explanations for this apparent trend stationarity of the price
level during the inflation-targeting period. First, it may be just an artefact of the particularly
benign environment obtaining for much of the sample period. More data from less benign
times may overturn this result, so it will be worth revisiting in the future.

Second, the need for accountability and credibility may encourage a central bank to target
average inflation over a number of years, offsetting a period of above-target inflation with a
subsequent period of below-target inflation. And in some countries, such as Australia, the
objective is explicitly defined as being “over the cycle”. But, as already noted, average
inflation targeting approaches price-level targeting as the horizon extends to infinity.

Third, optimal policy under uncertainty may lead to some correction of price-level deviations.
For instance, suppose that a shock has caused inflation to move above target. As time passes
and the central bank seeks to return inflation to target, it is possible that further shocks push
inflation away from the intended path or that tighter monetary policy fails to return inflation
to target as quickly as expected. With the usual concave objective function, the policymaker
should prefer to err on the side of inflation undershooting its intended path, rather than risk
departing even further above target. Consequently, in the presence of uncertainty, the
monetary authority will seek to return inflation to target more rapidly and may even aim to
keep inflation below target for a period. For more on this, see Kamenik et al (2008).

Whatever the explanation for the trend-stationarity of the price level, these results suggest
that existing policy frameworks have delivered something quite close to price-level targeting
in practice. That suggests the welfare gains from making the extra step may be limited,
particularly when there are costs to changing the framework. The issue is, nevertheless,
worthy of further investigation.

5.

The Objectives of Monetary Policy: Credit and Asset-Price Boom-Busts

We now return to the relationship between monetary policy and credit/asset-price boombusts. As discussed in Section 2, a case can be made that monetary policy played a bit part in
the rapid expansion of credit in the run-up to the crisis, together with the attendant
compression in risk premia and the boom in asset prices, especially that of housing. That

28

prompts the obvious question as to whether a different monetary policy setting could have
materially reduced the likelihood or magnitude of the banking crisis.

In the period immediately preceding the crisis, there was a lively debate amongst central
bankers as to the best way to respond to rapid credit growth and rising asset prices. On the
one hand, economists at the Bank for International Settlements and elsewhere (e.g. Borio and
White, 2003; Cecchetti, Genberg and Wadhwani, 2002; White, 2006, 2009) argued that,
despite the stability of inflation, monetary policy was nevertheless too loose. Moreover, the
credit/asset-price boom was storing up trouble for the future. Central banks should, they
argued, “lean against the wind” (LATW) by holding policy rates higher than suggested by,
for instance, a suitable Taylor Rule so as to mitigate these risks, even though the inflation
objective might not be immediately threatened. Indeed, an inflation-targeting central bank
ought to be willing to undershoot its target in the medium term, if it could thereby sufficiently
improve the chances of meeting its target further out through the avoidance of a disruptive
bust (Bean, 2003). Essentially, this involves the policymaker adopting a somewhat longer
perspective than is sometimes the case in inflation-targeting regimes.

On the other hand, other policymakers – most notably at the Federal Reserve – advocated a
policy of benign neglect during the boom phase, coupled with aggressive relaxation
(“cleaning”) should asset prices go into reverse (see e.g. Greenspan, 2002). Some analytical
support for this approach was provided by Bernanke and Gertler (1999). The justification for
this strategy rested on the following arguments.

First, the policymaker needs to judge whether the credit/asset-price boom is warranted by
fundamentals or whether it is instead based on misplaced expectations and furthermore poses
a threat to future financial and macroeconomic stability; a mechanical response that treats all
asset-price movements alike, whatever their cause, will be inappropriate. That is rarely
straightforward given that credit/asset-price booms are apt to occur in the wake of genuine
improvements in fundamentals – though central bankers are, of course, called upon to make
difficult judgments all the time, for instance over the margin of spare capacity.

29

Second, once a bubble is large enough to be identified, the presence of lags in the monetary
transmission mechanism complicate the calibration of an appropriate policy. Raising official
interest rates could be counterproductive if the boom immediately turns to bust, so that the
economy is subject to the twin deflationary impulses of an asset-price collapse and the effect
of the policy tightening. Indeed, in the unlikely event that the policy maker knows that an
asset-price collapse is imminent, monetary relaxation, rather than tightening, is called for.
Gruen, Plumb and Stone (2003) show that the information needed to render a LATW policy
effective is demanding.

Third, a modest increase in interest rates may do little to restrain a credit/asset-price boom
that is in full swing. But an increase large enough to materially affect the evolution of asset
prices is likely to have a significant adverse impact on economic activity. So the policy
maker needs to believe that the (certain) short-term costs of such a strategy are outweighed
by the (uncertain) longer-term gains. Moreover, if the key concern is a build-up of debt,
higher interest rates could actually exacerbate the problem if the resulting increase in debt
service outweighs the reduction in new borrowing.

Whatever the merits of the above arguments, the fall-out in the real economy from the
banking crisis seems to have made a policy of benign neglect towards potentially
unsustainable credit/asset-price booms untenable and, at least in the absence of other
instruments, rather tipped the balance towards “leaning” rather than “cleaning”. But that still
leaves open the question as to how effective a LATW interest-rate policy would have been in
the past and could be in the future.

In order to provide some evidence on this question, we employ the vector auto-regressions
estimated in Section 2 to assess how effective a relatively aggressive LATW policy would
have been in moderating the credit/asset-price boom. Specifically, we inject a series of
interest rate surprises calculated to leave policy rates roughly 200 basis points higher over the
pre-crisis period 2003-2006, implying a substantially tighter policy than was actually
followed. As most advocates of LATW seem to have in mind a relatively modest increase in
policy rates, this seems to be at the upper bound of what might be considered appropriate.

30

Conducting the counterfactual policy experiment by inputting a different sequence of
monetary policy shocks without changing the policy rate reaction function is potentially
subject to the Lucas Critique, but seems reasonable as it is likely that private agents would
have taken time to alter their beliefs about that reaction function.

Charts 7a and 7b show the implications of this policy, for the United States and United
Kingdom respectively, together with one standard deviation confidence bands11; Table 3
presents some associated statistics for the median paths. The Federal Funds rate would have
started rising in 2003, rather than mid-2004 and peaks at around 7.5 per cent in late 2006.
The policy is quite effective at dampening real house price inflation, though the impact on
real credit growth is more muted. Real house prices would have peaked around 7.5 per cent
lower. But the stock of real credit would have been just 3 per cent lower by the end of 2006,
trivial compared to the expansion in credit of almost 30 per cent.

For the United Kingdom, Bank Rate would have been around 7 per cent from the end of 2004
to mid-2007. Again this is effective in reducing real house price inflation, indeed more so
than in the United States. Real house prices are around a fifth lower at the end of 2006. The
effect on real credit growth is also somewhat more powerful than in the United States, with
the stock of real credit some 4 per cent lower by the end of 2006. But again this is trivial
compared to the almost 50 per cent increase in the stock of credit seen over the period.

These simulations also carry a sting in the tail, as output growth is significantly reduced. By
2007 Q3, just as the financial crisis erupted, the cumulative loss of output in the United States
amounts to around 3.3 per cent of real GDP; the equivalent figure for the United Kingdom is
3 per cent. These costs are significant, though still modest compared to the output falls
during the recession of around 8 per cent in the United States and over 10 per cent in the
United Kingdom, relative to a continuation of pre-crisis trends. So this could be an insurance
premium worth paying if there was a reasonable chance that it could have prevented these
falls. (The regression model obviously does not capture the inherently non-linear link
between the earlier credit/house-price boom and the subsequent near-collapse of the banking
system and associated contraction in output; any gain from this more restrictive policy in
terms of reducing the likelihood of a future bust is therefore absent – that is why the extent of
11

As the simulations are conducted by inputting a sequence of shocks to the monetary policy reaction function
rather than imposing a path for the policy rate, there is a confidence band around the policy rate as well.

31

the downturn in 2008-9 is largely unaffected.) Although the impact on house prices is
quantitatively significant, the limited impact on credit – arguably the more important variable
in determining the vulnerability of the system – as well as the plethora of other factors at
work in creating the crisis, makes us reluctant to conclude that it would have had a major
impact on the probability of a crisis materialising. But ultimately this is very much in the eye
of the beholder, as we cannot be sure what would have happened under the alternative policy.

There may nevertheless be times when a well-judged monetary policy intervention is
particularly effective in curbing financial excesses. Adrian and Shin (2008) point out that
even small policy rate changes can have a large impact if financial intermediaries are highly
leveraged and the changes in the policy rate affect the relevant market interest rates. And
there may be times when a mixture of words and modest interest rate action is effective at
cooling excessive market exuberance; both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Riksbank
attempted to take some of the steam out of the house price boom in this way. But, generally
speaking, monetary policy seems too weak an instrument reliably to moderate a credit/assetprice boom without inflicting unacceptable collateral damage on activity. Instead, with an
additional objective of managing credit growth and asset prices in order to avoid financial
instability, one really wants another instrument that acts more directly on the source of the
problem. That is what “macro-prudential policy” is supposed to achieve.

There are multiple dimensions to macro-prudential policy. On the one hand, it encompasses
actions to make the banking system more robust to shocks, recognising the
interconnectedness of financial institutions. This interconnectedness was somewhat
neglected in the run-up to the crisis, when it was assumed that if banks were individually
safe, then the system would be too. The presence of network externalities meant this was far
from being the case. A key ingredient here is increasing not only the quantity of capital
available to absorb losses but also its quality, as some capital instruments have turned out to
be ineffective loss absorbers unless the bank is liquidated. Instruments that bail in creditors
before that point is reached, such as contingent convertible bonds, therefore hold some
attraction. That is particularly important for institutions deemed too large or too systemically
important to fail. In addition, structural reforms can improve the robustness of the financial
system. These issues are currently the object of discussion within the Financial Stability
Board and the Basle Committee and firm proposals, together with a transition timetable, are

32

due shortly. While this territory is beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth noting that
effective measures to improve the robustness of the financial system, by reducing the
likelihood and severity of future crises, also reduce the need for monetary policy to LATW.

On the other hand, there is also a potential role for macro-prudential policy to cool
credit/asset-price booms that appear to be getting out of hand. Most discussion of such
instruments has so far revolved around the introduction of a pro-cyclical capital buffer.
Banks would be required to build up extra capital/reserves during a credit/asset-price boom,
which can then be run down in the event of a bust. This should reduce the incentive for
banks to leverage up in a boom, as well as making the financial system more robust in a bust.
Other instruments could, however, be deployed to this end. For instance, credit/asset-price
booms are usually characterised by an excessive shift into riskier forms of lending. In that
case, an instrument more directly targeted at the microeconomic distortion would be to
increase the risk-weights attached to such lending when computing banks’ required capital.
And, as we have seen in the present crisis, much of the action may take place outside the
regulated banking system in the wider credit markets. In that case, varying margin
requirements might be a more appropriate instrument for dealing with vulnerabilities building
up in the capital markets more generally. Finally, there is the option of introducing direct
constraints on the terms or availability of credit, for instance imposing maximum loan-tovalue ratios in the mortgage market. The best approach seems likely to involve a portfolio of
instruments. And while experience of the use of these tools may be limited, it is not entirely
a tabula rasa. In particular, a number of developing and emerging economies have
experience in applying some of these instruments, while there are also lessons to be drawn
from the past experience of some advanced economies too.

Our aim here, though, is not to analyse the optimal design of the macro-prudential policy
toolkit, but rather to consider how the deployment of such instruments might affect the
conduct of monetary policy. As yet, there has been relatively little analysis of how the
operation of macro-prudential policy might interact with monetary policy. We explore two
related issues. First, both monetary policy and macro-prudential policy are likely to affect
both aggregate demand and supply on the one hand and conditions in the banking sector on
the other. Is it possible that the two are sufficiently close in their effects that they are in
effect perfect substitutes? In that case, it is not clear that having the additional instrument is

33

of much value; the two instruments need to have sufficiently differentiated effects to be
useful. Second, to the extent that they are sufficiently independent, is there any danger of a
“push-me, pull-you” outcome if the instruments are set by different authorities?

To investigate these issues, we employ a standard, though stylised, sticky-price New
Keynesian macroeconomic model, augmented to incorporate both physical capital and a
simple banking sector. The model is a version of that of Gertler and Karadi (2009), stripped
of features such as habit persistence that are inessential for our purposes. The key additional
ingredients relative to the standard New Keynesian model are twofold. First, funds flowing
from savers to borrowers must be intermediated through a banking system. Banks take in
deposits, Dt, from households, on which they contract to pay a given nominal interest rate.
Together with their stock of retained profits (bank capital, Bt), these funds are then lent out to
finance the physical capital that firms carry through into the next period. The real (gross)
return on this lending, Rkt+1, then includes the marginal product of that capital plus any
associated capital gains or losses as the price of physical capital evolves, net of the inflation
rate. Second, banks need to be sufficiently incentivised to monitor their borrowers, who
would otherwise misuse the funds; this requires that the real profits from lending exceed the
effort of monitoring, λt per unit of loans. Formally, the incentive-compatibility constraint
takes the form12:

(1)

(Dt + Bt)(Rkt+1 – λt) ≥ DtRt ,

where Rt is the real (gross) return on deposits. Consequently, there is both a spread between
the real loan and deposit rates and an implied leverage limit on banks. Were banks to try to
lever up beyond this point by taking in more deposits and extending more loans, it would
reduce the return on bank capital net of monitoring effort, leaving them with insufficient
incentive to monitor the borrowers. Equilibrium leverage is therefore a decreasing function
of monitoring costs and an increasing function of the real loan-deposit spread, while total
lending is just the product of equilibrium leverage and the available bank capital. While
additional loans for investment only affect production possibilities in the following period,
they indirectly also raise current output because households supply more labour in order to
12

This is analogous to the no-shirking condition in some efficiency-wage models. Monitoring effort is
unobservable and therefore uncontractable. The resulting wedge between the deposit and lending rates also
means that the capital stock is inefficiently low.

34

avoid having to cut back current consumption to make room for that investment.
Consequently, an increase in credit supply resulting from a relaxation in this incentive
compatibility constraint provides both an indirect boost to output contemporaneously and a
direct boost through a higher capital stock in the following period.

There are two policy instruments. The first is monetary policy, which operates by changing
the deposit rate and the associated loan-deposit spread. The second is a (lump-sum)
levy/subsidy on the banking sector, which can be used to manipulate the amount of capital
that banks carry forward into the next period. Of course, this is not how macro-prudential
policy is expected to function in practice. But the model acts as a useful metaphor for
thinking how policies that alter the buffer of capital available to banks might affect the
dynamics of the economy and the conduct of monetary policy.

Both monetary and macro-prudential policies affect the incentive compatibility constraint (1)
and are therefore essentially alternative ways of expanding the supply of credit and with it the
volume of investment. With sticky prices, a reduction in the policy rate by the monetary
authority lowers the real deposit rate, raises the loan-deposit spread, increases equilibrium
leverage and raises the quantity of loans. And a change in available bank capital as a result of
the macro-prudential authority’s decisions translates directly into a higher volume of loans at
the existing leverage ratio. But monetary policy also has an independent effect on aggregate
demand by encouraging intertemporal substitution in consumption. This is not operative with
macro-prudential policy. Consequently the two instruments are imperfect substitutes in terms
of their effects on the economy. We shall illustrate this by comparing the impact on the
economy of a variety of shocks when only monetary policy is available with the outcomes
when the macro-prudential instrument is also available.

In each case, policy is set optimally. We assume a quadratic social loss function, which
penalises the variance of inflation, output and the physical capital stock about their efficient
frictionless levels. Other than the appearance of physical capital, this objective function is
standard. Edge (2003) shows that such a term appears when capital accumulation is
incorporated into the sticky-price New Keynesian framework and the objective function is
derived from first principles (along with a number of other terms, which for simplicity are
omitted here), though, with all investment funded through the banking system, we interpret it

35

as capturing financial stability concerns more broadly. We assume a weight of unity on the
variance of inflation and weights of 0.01 on the variances of output gap and the capital gap;
that is broadly consistent with extant calibrated models in which the objective function is
derived from first principles. Since expectations of future inflation, rates of profit, etc.,
matter in the model, it is valuable for policymakers to be able to commit to future actions so
as to influence those expectations, just as in the canonical New Keynesian framework. In the
first set of simulations, we assume a single policy maker who can commit (this simplifies
solving the model). We consider two policy environments: in the first case, the policy maker
uses only monetary policy; in the second case, the policy maker deploys both monetary and
macro-prudential instruments.

We focus on three sorts of shock: a total factor productivity (TFP) shock; a shock to the effort
necessary to monitor borrowers, λt; and a mark-up shock in the inflation equation. These
shocks are assumed to be temporary, though highly persistent. The TFP and mark-up shocks
are familiar from standard New Keynesian models and affect households and firms in the
usual way, though, by changing the return on capital, they also affect the equilibrium in the
banking sector. The shock to the monitoring cost represents a simple way of altering the
equilibrium leverage ratio and we think of it as a metaphor for changes in the willingness to
take on risk. A fall in the cost of monitoring – an “exuberance” shock – relaxes the banks’
incentive compatibility constraint and is associated with an increase in the equilibrium
leverage ratio, a fall in the loan-deposit spread and an increase in loans to firms; a “panic”
shock does the opposite.

Chart 8 shows the response of the economy to an adverse TFP shock, a financial “panic”
shock and a mark-up shock, assuming in each case that policy responds optimally. When
TFP falls (upper panel), it is efficient for the level of output to fall and the stock of physical
capital to gradually fall back. But the shock also leads to a large fall in the return on capital
and in its price. Left unaddressed, this would lead to a sharp drop in bank profits, a decline in
bank capital and a reduction in credit supply. If the leverage ratio were constant, that would

36

reduce the amount of investment, capital and output. That effect is, however, moderated by
expectations of a future recovery in the price of capital, which raises future returns on capital,
thus allowing higher leverage13, higher bank profits and a degree of “self-healing” in the
banking sector.

When monetary policy is the sole instrument available (dashed red line), the nominal interest
rate is cut briefly but returned to its steady-state value quickly. As described above, monetary
policy is acting on aggregate demand and credit supply simultaneously. This supports output
and capital but at the expense of a brief burst of inflation. The cut in the nominal interest rate
helps boost the future loan-deposit spread but cannot prevent a fall in bank capital. Note also
that the increase in the future loan-deposit spread pushes up the leverage ratio.

The response is, though, quite different when the policy maker can deploy the macroprudential tool too (solid blue line). Now, the policy maker uses the bank levy/subsidy to
prevent the sharp fall in bank capital. Monetary policy is then set to maintain output at its
new, lower, efficient level with prices unchanged; that requires only a minimal change to the
policy rate. Essentially the monetary policy maker does just what he would do if there were
no banking friction present, with the impact of that friction being offset through the macroprudential instrument.

Similar results obtain in the face of a financial “panic” (middle panel), which leads to a lower
volume of deposits and loans for a given level of bank capital. In this case, it is inefficient
for output or physical capital to fall, so policy needs to counteract the tightening in credit
conditions in order to stabilise inflation, output and capital. The viable path of leverage is
lower because of the tightening of the incentive compatibility constraint, so bank capital
needs to be higher to sustain investment. If this has to be done through monetary policy
alone, the nominal interest rate needs to be cut sharply initially in order to widen the lending
margin and build up the necessary extra bank capital. When the macro-prudential instrument
is also available, the necessary increase in bank capital can be achieved immediately using
the bank levy/subsidy, leaving physical capital, output and inflation unaffected, again
obviating the need for monetary policy to react.

13

Though note that this implies a countercyclical leverage ratio, which is somewhat at odds with experience.

37

The bottom panel of Chart 8 shows the response to a persistent positive mark-up shock.
Unless counteracted, the immediate impact of this shock is to push up inflation and to reduce
output, profits and the price of capital. When monetary policy is the only available
instrument, the presence of the banking friction leads the monetary authority to set the policy
rate at a lower level than it would if the friction were absent, in order to boost output and
moderate the decline in bank capital. Subsequently, the policy rate is returned to around its
steady-state level and inflation is stabilised by the emerging output gap. The lower path for
capital (and therefore investment) is maintained by a lower level of bank capital as the
leverage ratio returns to its previous level.

The case when both instruments are available is more complex. The ability to use two
instruments allows the policy maker to manipulate the capital to labour ratio by boosting
credit supply (through a reduction in the bank levy) and constraining labour supply (through a
higher nominal interest rate). The substitution of capital for labour reduces the marginal cost
of output, holding down inflation for a given level of output. Moreover, it puts capital and
output onto paths with much narrower gaps. But this capital-friendly policy boosts the
current return on, and price of, capital. Without an immediate rise in the bank levy, future
credit supply would be too high. It is this which gives rise to the rather odd oscillation in the
bank levy/subsidy.

While these results are specific to the model and should not to be taken literally, they do
suggest that policies should be assigned to the frictions that they have a comparative
advantage in addressing. In the model, the limit on leverage always binds. So it is
unsurprising that when adjustments to credit supply are called for, an instrument which acts
directly on that friction – the macro-prudential instrument – is more effective than one
working through several channels, namely monetary policy. So, to the extent that movements
in bank capital and leverage are key factors driving risk taking and aggregate lending, the
deployment of macro-prudential policy is likely to be more effective than trying to “lean
against the wind” using monetary policy.

The experiments shown in Chart 8 assume a single policy maker, who is able to commit to
future policies. In practice it is probably more plausible to assume an inability to commit, as
well as the possibility that decisions on monetary policy and macro-prudential policy are

38

made by different actors. In particular, the latter allows us to investigate the risk of a “pushme, pull-you” outcome, in which the macro-prudential authority tightens the availability of
credit and then the monetary authority just offsets that by lowering interest rates in order to
stimulate aggregate demand to keep inflation on track.

We first consider the case of a single policy maker who controls both instruments, but who is
unable to tie his hands over future policy actions (Chart 9, red dashed line). We focus on the
case of a mark-up shock since this generates the most interesting results; for TFP and
financial “panic” shocks the micro-prudential instrument alone generates good outcomes. In
this instance, the single policy maker can achieve similar outcomes for the output and capital
gaps to that under full commitment (black dotted line) but has to live with a somewhat higher
level of inflation. The main difference in the policy setting occurs in the first period because
the policy maker cannot manipulate leverage to the same degree through the future reversal
of the policy rate and the bank levy that occurs under commitment. For later periods, the
paths of the nominal interest rate and the bank levy are close, with higher nominal interest
rates moderated by a lower bank levy.

Next we consider the potential co-ordination problems when the two instruments are set by
different policy makers, where to mimic delegation each is assigned only a part of the social
objective function. So the monetary policy maker is given an objective over just the
variances of inflation and output, with weights of unity and 0.01, while the macro-prudential
policy maker is given one defined over the capital gap and the output gap, also with weights
of unity and 0.0114. The solid blue line in Chart 9 shows the outcome of the resulting Nash
game. Unsurprisingly, the capital gap is considerably narrower than under the single policy
maker, because it is so prominent in the objective function of the macro-prudential policy
maker. As a consequence, the outcomes for inflation and output are worse. Most notably,
the policy instruments are initially moved more sharply in opposing directions than is the
case with a single policy maker. As he does not care about the capital gap directly, the
monetary policy maker raises the policy rate more aggressively in order to contain inflation.
And the macro-prudential policy maker, who cares primarily about the capital gap, moves to
maintain bank capital by cutting the bank levy more aggressively. This therefore has
something of a “push-me, pull-you” feel to it, though in subsequent periods the policy
14

Note that if the macro-prudential policy maker only cared about the capital gap, he would ensure that it was
zero at all times.

39

instruments then move back more quickly towards their steady-state values than under a
single policy maker.

Although the simulations here do not result in an explosive contest between the two policy
makers, this issue clearly warrants further investigation. Delegation of the monetary and
macro-prudential instruments to different decision makers with distinct objectives is certainly
appealing on the grounds of clarity and accountability, especially since the knowledge and
expertise necessary to set interest rates are not necessarily the same as that required for the
deployment of the macro-prudential toolkit. But if the instruments are assigned to different
decision makers, the likelihood of a “pull-me, push-you” outcome in some circumstances
may also be correspondingly greater. So it is important to ensure the presence of suitable
mechanisms that facilitate the necessary co-ordination. In the arrangements recently
proposed by the new government in the United Kingdom that is to be achieved by putting
both the decision makers – the Monetary Policy Committee and the Financial Policy
Committee – in the same institution and ensuring that they have a number of members in
common.

6.

Concluding Remarks

To conclude, we return to the elements of the pre-crisis policy consensus outlined in the
introduction and ask what remains or how it needs to be modified.

1. The role of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is the topic of the next session. But we should
at least note that the collapse of private demand after the demise of Lehman Brothers
prompted not only the operation of the automatic stabilisers but also additional
discretionary fiscal policy measures in the most affected economies, with the total
fiscal impulse coming in at around 4 per cent of GDP. But the effectiveness of those
expansionary fiscal policies in stimulating demand remains a matter of debate, both in
policy making circles and academia. On the one hand, there are those who believe the
fiscal multipliers are negligible, either because of Ricardian Equivalence or because
of crowding out through the impact of high public debt and deficits on long-term
interest rates. On the other hand, there are those who reject these arguments and
argue that the reduced effectiveness of monetary policy at the ZLB and during a credit
crisis makes this the only effective macroeconomic policy weapon at the current

40

juncture. Whatever the resolution of this debate, however, the traditional arguments
against activist fiscal policies seem likely to still obtain once normal times return.

2. The choice of monetary instrument. Given the above, monetary policy is likely once
more to take on the primary role in short-term aggregate demand management once
normal times return. But the apparent effectiveness of asset purchases at altering
longer-term yields opens up the possibility that they could become part of the
monetary toolkit in normal times. We argued in Section 3 that despite its apparent
effectiveness, there were good reasons to return to exclusive reliance on a short-term
policy rate in normal times and after any asset purchases during the crisis have been
appropriately unwound.

3. The monetary transmission mechanism. The crisis has brutally exposed the limitations
of conventional macroeconomic analysis ignoring the role of financial intermediaries.
While the existing literature contained a strand focussing on the role of financial
frictions – including those on the broad credit channel – they generally focussed on
those that arose from the behaviour of borrowers. The crisis has illustrated the need
to take seriously the incentives facing the intermediaries themselves. Researchers are
already starting to fill this hole (the Gertler-Karadi model employed in Section 5 is
but one example) and it is a reasonable bet that the literature will be in a very different
place in a few years time. It may be tempting to think that these frictions will become
less important when normal times return and therefore that the ability to model the
behaviour of intermediaries will only be necessary during bad times. That would be,
though, an error. Central bankers, as guardians of overall financial stability, need to
understand the risks building up in the financial system better than we did during the
run-up to the present crisis. That requires greater attention to such issues during good
times.

4. Central bank independence. Nothing that has happened over the past decade or so
suggests that the thinking behind the delegation of monetary policy to an
operationally independent central bank is flawed. But the application of unorthodox
policies during the crisis has inevitably forced the central banks concerned to work
more closely with finance ministries and sometimes taken them into politically

41

sensitive territory that they would rather not inhabit. Normal times should make it
possible to retreat from these unorthodox policies, but a concern to circumscribe the
central bank’s powers may well linger.

5. The pursuit of price stability. Because monetary policy failed to prevent the crisis,
some have suggested that the emphasis on price stability has been misplaced and that
inflation targeting has “failed”. But the price-stability oriented policies of the Great
Moderation proved to be instrumental in delivering not just low and stable inflation
but also steady growth for a sustained period. The maintenance of price stability may
be insufficient on its own to guarantee continued overall macroeconomic stability, but
it surely has to remain the central objective of monetary policy in the long run, even if
other considerations may intrude in the short run. Any other objective risks deanchoring price expectations and inducing unnecessary extra volatility into the
economy. Flexible inflation targets (explicit or implicit), which allow the monetary
authority some constrained discretion in accommodating temporary price-level
shocks, therefore remain a suitable organising framework for the conduct of monetary
policy. We remain sceptical of the net benefits of moving to a higher inflation target
in normal times so as to provide monetary policy with more room for manoeuvre.
And a move to price-level targeting looks likely to offer only modest gains –
particularly when there are also costs to changing the framework – though further
analysis may shed additional light on this particular issue (Section 4).

6. Monetary policy and credit/asset-price booms. The twin beliefs that financial markets
are efficient and that financial innovation is necessarily welfare-enhancing have been
dealt a serious blow by the crisis. We have seen that financial markets are riddled
with any number of incentive distortions and market failures. Alongside that, the
crisis has also raised serious question marks about a policy of benign neglect towards
credit/asset-price booms. In the absence of other instruments, the case for “leaning
against the wind” by setting policy rates higher during the boom phase seems stronger
than before. But, at least most of the time, monetary policy does not seem like the
most appropriate instrument to call on – it is not targeted at the key friction and
involves too much collateral damage to activity. The deployment of macro-prudential
instruments, focussed more directly on the source of the excessive exuberance seems

42

more appropriate. But we still have much to learn about how such instruments work
in practice and how they interface with monetary policy.

7. The relationship between price stability and financial stability. It is now pretty clear
that price stability is not a sufficient condition for financial stability. Indeed, the
empirical results of Section 2 suggest that the reduction in volatility associated with
the Great Moderation may have contributed to excessively optimistic assessments of
risk, the compression of risk premia and the expansion in leverage. That does not
imply central banks should retreat from the pursuit of price stability, and
macroeconomic stability more generally. But it does suggest that policy makers need
both to be aware that long periods of benign conditions may foster excessive privatesector risk-taking, and to be ready to take the necessary action when that happens.

43

Appendix: The Model of Section 5
The model is a slimmed down version of Gertler and Karadi (2009). The economy is
populated by two types of agents: producer/consumer households and bankers. Households
live forever and have standard intertemporal preferences over consumption (Ct) and hours
worked (Ht). Investment (It), which is subject to adjustment costs, cannot be funded directly
by households and instead must be financed by borrowing from a bank. Bank loans (Lt) are
financed by the capital of bankers (Bt) and deposits (Dt) from households. Banks are owned
and run by bankers. A proportion (1-γ) of bankers die at the end of each period and are
replaced by a new generation. Bankers reinvest all their earnings in the capital of the bank
whilst they live, and leave their net wealth to households when they die.
In log-linear form (carets denote log-deviations from steady-state), the standard block of the
model is described by:
1)

Market-clearing condition for output (Yt);
1

2)

Production function (Zt is TFP and Kt is capital);

3)

Labour market equilibrium (Xt is
marginal costs);

4)

Price of physical capital (qt);

5) ̂

1

Return on capital (rkt);
1

6)

Law of motion for physical capital;
̂

7)
8)

Consumption Euler equation (rnt is deposit rate);
New Keynesian Phillips curve (πt is inflation

rate).
The special ingredient is a moral hazard friction in the banking sector. As households are
unable to finance investment directly but most borrow the funds from a bank, the value of the
stock of physical capital, qtKt, is equal to the level of bank loans, which, because banks are
assumed to hold no other assets, is also equal to bank capital plus deposits
9)

.

But bankers must exert (unobservable) effort (λt) per unit of loans each period to ensure that
borrowers invest in productive physical capital rather than unproductive status symbols with
private benefit and no recovery value for the bank. So in order for monitoring to be incentive
compatible, the cost of monitoring must be less than or equal to the gross return on lending,
10)

44

where Rkt and Rt are gross returns on loans and deposits, respectively. Putting these banking
sector equations together and recalling that bankers do not consume but pass on their wealth
when they die, we have two additional equilibrium conditions, a no-shirking condition for
bankers :
11)
where

and

; and a law of motion for bank capital:

12) B

B

,

where τt is a bank levy/subsidy. Equation (11) shows that the leverage ratio is an increasing
function of the spread between the return on capital but decreasing in the monitoring cost (λt).
Equation (12) shows that bank capital accumulates according to the profits of surviving
bankers. Changes in bank profits, in turn, reflect the average spread between the loan rate
and the deposit rate on changes on the deposit base, the average return on lending on changes
in bank capital, positive shocks to the rate of return on current lending and negative shocks to
the deposit rate.

We assume that policy makers seek to minimise a loss function:






13) L    j  t2 j   y yt  j  yt* j
j 0



2



  l k t  j  k t* j


2

The addition of the arguments in kt is designed to reflect financial stability concerns. We
assume equal weights of 1 on inflation and 0.01 on the output gap and capital gap. The
starred variables are the levels of output and lending which would hold in a frictionless
economy.

Policymakers are set the nominal interest rate and the bank levy/subsidy. The model was
calibrated with standard parameter values at a quarterly frequency (see, for example,
Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist, 1999). Bank leverage was set at 10 in the steady state and
the steady-state spread between the return on capital and the deposit rate is 1 percent.
