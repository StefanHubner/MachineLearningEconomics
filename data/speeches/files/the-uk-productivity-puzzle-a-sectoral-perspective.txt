Over the past year, the economy has seen a remarkable recovery – the pace of which has caught many by
surprise. Output has grown on average by 0.8% per quarter since last summer, and by the first quarter of this
year was just half a percent short of its pre-crisis peak. Over the same period, over half a million jobs
(roughly 700,000) were created, pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.6% in April. And employment
surveys suggest that gross hiring is likely to continue at a robust pace in coming months (Chart 1).

The prospects for a sustained recovery now look better than for some time. But behind that good news lies a
continuing puzzle. While the creation of new jobs is to be welcomed, its pace and timing, relative to the
increase in output, leaves unanswered questions about the productivity performance of the economy.

Typically, labour market variables lag changes in activity. At the onset of recessions, companies take time to
lay off employees as they gauge the extent of the contraction in demand, so the rise in unemployment tends
to follow the decline in activity. Conversely, in the early stages of recovery, companies tend to wait before
hiring new staff, as they assess the durability of the pickup in demand, and initially seek to match it by
working their existing employees more efficiently. As a result, job creation tends to lag the recovery in output.
This explains why productivity has typically been pro-cyclical: output per worker tends to rise or fall with
output, as adjustments to headcount come with a lag.

The puzzle that continues to exercise the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is that the behaviour of
productivity in the aftermath of the financial crisis has been very different from historical experience.
Productivity has been extremely and uncharacteristically weak since the end of the recession in mid-2009,
compared with the episodes of the 1980s and 1990s (Chart 2). As of 2014Q1, productivity, measured as
output per worker, was still roughly 3.5% below its pre-crisis level in 2007.

A number of explanations have been put forward to explain this weakness in productivity. Initially, many felt
that it could be simple error in the measurement of the GDP data. This cannot be ruled out, although the size
of the productivity shortfall would make that measurement error very large indeed. As the puzzle persisted,
other hypotheses have been advanced, some by my colleagues, including: forbearance on the part of banks
and the low interest rate environment keeping unproductive firms alive; stresses in the banking sector
1

impairing the efficient allocation of capital, and firms faced with uncertainty choosing to substitute labour for
capital.2 In a speech given in early 2013, I offered a further explanation: that part of the productivity puzzle is
a by-product of companies’ rational decisions to hold on to their employees for their firm-specific skills, even
3

when faced with weak demand. And earlier this week, a Quarterly Bulletin article by Bank staff was
published which offers a very comprehensive, if not necessarily exhaustive, review of the factors behind the
weakness of productivity since the financial crisis.

Even taken together, these explanations still leave a good deal of uncertainty as to the sources of the
weakness of productivity. Yet a fuller understanding of why productivity has remained so weak, and to what
extent it is therefore likely to recover, is critical for the path of interest rates as the expansion continues.

Of particular importance is the extent to which supply responds to demand over the next two-to-three years.
Under the second phase of our forward guidance, which came into effect in April when the unemployment
rate fell below 7%, the MPC is focussing on the degree of slack in the economy, both within the labour
market and within companies. There is, as you might expect with a concept that is difficult to measure, some
difference of opinion amongst the Committee as to the exact level of slack that currently exists, although we
can agree that there is some still to absorb before full capacity is reached. But equally important, as we look
forward over the next two to three years, is the pace at which that existing spare capacity will be absorbed,
and critical to that will be the degree to which productivity recovers.5 In a nutshell, the faster the recovery in
productivity, the slower the absorption of remaining spare capacity over the forecast horizon, which would
allow a longer time before the first rise in interest rates and a more gradual trajectory thereafter.

A sectoral approach to the productivity puzzle

As I alluded to earlier, most approaches have sought to explain the weakness of productivity by appealing to
whole-economy explanations. That is quite natural for macroeconomists – especially so for monetary
policymakers concerned with fluctuations in aggregate demand. But the behaviour of aggregate productivity
in recent years has masked stark differences across sectors, with some sectors exhibiting dramatic declines
in productivity, and others experiencing productivity movements more akin to those in previous cycles. While
such differences do not in themselves rule out a set of common whole-economy drivers, they are sufficiently
stark to suggest that the reasons behind the productivity weakness are likely to be more numerous, diverse
and complex than sometimes assumed.

So today I would like to examine the productivity puzzle from another angle – by adopting a sectoral
approach. I will first look at productivity performance by sector, and in some cases, sub-sector of the
economy. Even though the data at the lower levels of disaggregation are less robust, such disaggregation
into subsectors is necessary to obtain a sufficiently granular and homogenous set of economic activities
within each subsector. To give one example: ‘Transportation & Storage’ covers activities as diverse as
warehousing, freight transport and postal and courier services. Only by breaking this sector into the
individual economic activities can the very different developments in measured productivity for each activity
be understood, and potential causes identified.

To provide likely explanations of the causes of differential productivity performance across sectors, I will
draw on a database of intelligence compiled by the Bank’s Agency network from their company visits. The
Bank’s Agents visit about 5,500 company contacts each year, and the intelligence they gather provides

5

direct evidence of the factors affecting business performance, both from the company itself and via the
Agents’ interpretation.

I will focus on those sectors which have seen dramatic falls in productivity since 2007. It is these sectors that
have driven the recent weakness at a whole-economy level, and which are most likely to determine to what
extent productivity performance improves as the recovery continues. In particular, I will try to draw some
conclusions for each of these sectors that distinguishes the element of their weak productivity performance
that has been caused directly by the persistent weakness of demand (demand-contingent productivity
weakness) – which might be expected to recover as demand strengthens and broadens – and the element
that is independent of the cycle (non-cyclical productivity weakness) which might be expected to recover only
more slowly, if at all.

Sectoral productivity performance

As a first pass, it is possible to break down the shortfall in whole-economy productivity by sector, based on
the UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Table 1 ranks the 18 high-level sectors that make up
aggregate UK gross value added (GVA), in descending order of their percentage contribution to the shortfall
in aggregate productivity relative to 2007.6

To be clear, the shortfall here is calculated as the percentage difference between the level of productivity in
2013Q4 and that in 2007, rather than relative to some pre-crisis trend. This is different to some previous
treatments (such as in the recent Quarterly Bulletin article), but bypasses the need to calculate trend
productivity in each sector, a thorny issue given the volatility of the data, and allows us to be agnostic about
the extent to which any pre-crisis trend should be extrapolated post-crisis. That said, the magnitude of the
measured shortfall will inevitably depend on the exact reference year chosen (2007 in this case).

However, there are two statistical issues that require caution when interpreting this sectoral breakdown. The
first is that the output measure is the output GVA data, not balanced to the expenditure measurement of
GVA, let alone GDP. Second, the chain-linking methodology used by the ONS means that sectoral estimates
do not aggregate to published totals before 2010. As a result, the bottom-up, GVA-based shortfall of 5%
shown in Table 1 is not directly comparable with the whole-economy, GDP-based shortfall of 3.5% shown in
Chart 1. For these reasons, the emphasis in reading the table should be placed on the relative contributions
of the various sectors, rather than the precise magnitude of the shortfall.

Note that calculations are based on output GVA data, which are not balanced to the income and expenditure measurements of GVA.
The sectoral output GVA data are compiled by the ONS and can be found here: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-referencetables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-328821. Although the data are chain-linked, the annual chain-linking methodology introduced in 2003
means that sectoral estimates do not aggregate to published totals 'except after the last year which is used as a base year’, which is
2010 in the current vintage (see 'The effects of annual chain-linking on the output measure of GDP' for more information). As a result,
the aggregate shortfall of 5% between 2007 and 2013Q4 shown in Table 1, which is calculated by aggregating the sectoral GVA data, is
not directly comparable with the expenditure-based GDP aggregate shown in Chart 1.
7
A further complication is that while the output data are collected at reporting unit level, the Workforce Jobs employment data are
reported at local unit level. This may introduce distortions into the absolute sectoral productivity calculations, but that is the only way to
disaggregate the data sufficiently for our purposes.

4

One is struck by the fact that only six sectors – representing close to 40% of total GVA and total employment
– “explain”, at least in an accounting sense, the aggregate productivity shortfall. Moreover, the magnitude of
the shifts in these six sectors – individual contributions of at least 10% – far outweighs the fluctuations in
other sectors. These sectors (with their percentage contribution to the aggregate productivity shortfall in
brackets) are: ‘Mining & quarrying’ (22%), Financial & Insurance’ (20%), ‘Transportation & storage’ (19%),
‘Education’ (16%), ‘Professional, scientific & technical activities’ (16%), and ‘Health & social activities’ (10%).
Looking at the rest of the table, six other sectors have seen smaller falls in productivity since 2007,8 but,
again in an accounting sense, their contribution is roughly balanced by the five sectors where productivity
has risen over the past six years.9

The table also indicates the changes in output and employment relative to 2007, to give a sense of the
relative importance of each in driving productivity change.10 It is immediately apparent that the sectors which
have made a sizeable contribution to the aggregate productivity shortfall have each experienced very
different employment and output dynamics.

Some, such as ‘Mining & quarrying’ and ‘Transportation & storage’, have seen outright falls in output but
gains in employment. Others, such as ‘Education’ and ‘Professional, scientific & technical activities’ have
experienced increases in output, but even larger ones in employment. And other sectors, such as ‘Financial
& Insurance’, have seen falls in output accompanied by smaller declines in employment. Even at this higher
level of disaggregation, the diversity of performance suggests that a number of different explanations may lie
behind.

But at this high level of sectoral disaggregation, the economic activities represented by many of these
sectors are far from homogeneous. In the financial sector, for example, what is happening in banking is likely
to differ from what is happening in insurance, so that the patterns of output and employment at this level do
not necessarily offer the best characterisation of what is going on in the many sub-sectors (or divisions in
ONS parlance) that make up those sectors.

This is why it is necessary to delve into greater detail, using the low-level GVA aggregates compiled by the
ONS. However it is worth noting that these estimates are not part of regular ONS publications, because they
can be very volatile and subject to revision, and as such they need to be interpreted with caution.

For our purposes, this means that aggregating the productivity data for each of the low-level GVA divisions
yields an estimate of the whole-economy productivity shortfall since 2007 (of 5.4%) that is different not only
from that based on the aggregate GDP data (3.5%) but also from that calculated by aggregating the

‘Construction’,‘Other services’, ‘Electricity, gas & steam’, ‘Accommodation & food services’, ‘Water supply’, ‘Agriculture’ and ‘Real
estate less imputed rent’.
9
‘Manufacturing’, ‘Public administration’, ‘Wholesale & retail trade’, ‘Administrative & support activities’ and ‘Information &
communication’.
10
The lack of reliable sectoral data on average hours worked means it is not possible to investigate the extent to which changes in
average hours worked might have offset or exacerbated changes in employment in different sectors.

5

higher-level GVA sectors (5.0%). In other words, the low-level GVA data can help us to uncover which
divisions have been the largest contributors to the weakness of aggregate productivity since 2007, but little
weight should be placed on the exact percentage point contribution to the whole-economy productivity
shortfall.

We can thus rank the low-level divisions that make up aggregate UK GVA, in descending order of their
percentage contribution to the shortfall in aggregate productivity relative to 2007 – bearing in mind that not
too much should be made of the precise ordinal ranking.

Table 2 focuses on those divisions that make a contribution of at least four percent to the aggregate
productivity shortfall since 2007. Among these, eight divisions account for the entirety of the weakness of
productivity over the past six years. These are ‘Mining and the extraction of crude petroleum/gas’ (22%),
‘Education’ (15%), ‘Financial service activities’ (excluding insurance and pension funding) (13.5%), ‘Social
work activities’ (12%), ‘Activities of head offices; Management consultancy’ (11%), ‘Services to buildings and
landscape activities’ (10%), ‘Warehousing and support activities for transportation’ (9%), and ‘Postal and
courier services’ (8%).

The remaining six divisions “over-explain” another 30% of the puzzle – these are: ‘Wholesale trade’
(excluding motor vehicles) (6%), ‘Activities auxiliary to financial services and insurance activities’ (5.5%),
‘Construction of buildings’ (5%), ‘Residential care activities’ (4.5%), ‘Electricity, gas, steam and air
conditioning supply’ (4.5%) and ‘Legal and accounting activities’ (4%).

Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of these divisions belong to sectors that feature at the top of Table 1, but
others, including ‘Services to buildings and landscape activities’ or ‘Wholesale trade’, are not picked up by
the higher level data.

The table also provides a series of narratives for the observed productivity performance of each division,
based on the intelligence obtained by the Bank’s Agents during their company visits.

Looking through the narratives, a number of explanations span several divisions. But let me deal with those
that are more sector-specific first.

The single largest contributor (22%) to the productivity shortfall since 2007 is oil and gas extraction, which
makes up the bulk (roughly 70% in 2013) of the Mining & quarrying sector. The story here is familiar: the
gradual depletion of reserves and the growing obsolescence of production equipment has been behind a
persistent decline in production for some years, while the need for minimum staffing levels in a
capital-intensive industry, combined with the need for increasingly complex maintenance and investment,
have prevented staffing levels from adjusting fully to the change in output.

6

‘Education’ contributes about 15% to the productivity shortfall, but interpreting the measured fall in output per
head in that sector needs to be done with great caution. Gross value added, which captures the numbers of
nursery, primary and secondary pupils (adjusted for attendance and including an annual quality adjustment),
has risen since 2007, mirroring the growth of population. But the number of employees (teachers, teaching
and other support staff) has risen even faster. This may reflecting a shift in the employment mix due to a
greater use of teaching assistants in response to budgetary pressures. That the measurement of heads
takes no account of changes in employment mix, and that fully quality-adjusted output is so difficult to
measure in this sector gives few insightful conclusions, other than, as measured, it is a sizeable contributor
to the measured fall in aggregate productivity.

‘Services to buildings and landscape activities’, which essentially consists of cleaning services and
landscaping, and accounts for 10% of the aggregate productivity shortfall, is likely to have seen staffing
numbers rise as customers look to outsource services in an effort to reduce their costs, while competitive
pressures and re-tenders have kept service levels low.

The narratives for ‘Social work’, ‘Wholesale trade’ and ‘Residential care activities’, three sub-sectors that
respectively account for 12%, 6% and 4.5% of the productivity shortfall, are less well supported by the
Agents’ intelligence network. It is possible however to make some informed conjectures about what has been
behind the relative movements of output and employment in these sectors.

Much like ‘Education’, ‘Social work’, which broadly refers to counselling and welfare services carried out by
government offices or private charitable organisations, and ‘Residential care activities’, which mainly refers to
nursing care activities, are sectors where both output and employment are difficult to measure and interpret.
One possible, yet partial, explanation for the weakness of output relative to employment in ‘Social work’
since 2007 is a move to the provision of foster care rather than institutional care for children. Foster care is
less costly but is believed to be of much higher quality. However, in the measured data for such activities,
such a shift to a lower-cost from a higher-cost service can appear as a lesser increase in output.

A number of themes run through the narratives of the other divisions. Let me explore each in turn.

The first theme is changing regulation. This has required companies in several sub-sectors to maintain or
increase staffing levels relative to output. In financial services (both traditional banking and auxiliary services
such as brokers and exchanges, which taken together account for roughly 19% of the productivity shortfall)
and to a lesser extent in ‘Legal and accounting activities’, more staff are required to manage new
infrastructure, system and regulatory requirements. In a similar vein, the construction sector (which
contributes 5% to the productivity shortfall) reports that it has been affected by increased regulation of the
environmental impact of construction. Given a low-margin environment, the associated rise in building costs
has led customers to request redesigns to remove cost elsewhere, weighing on the productivity of
construction workers. In ‘Warehousing and support activities for transportation’ (which accounts for 9% of the
productivity shortfall), tighter security measures at airports have led to falls in productivity as airport

7

management hire additional staff in response to delays in passing through security. In ‘Electricity, gas and
steam’, which accounts for 4.5% of the shortfall, it is likely that regulated green initiatives may well have
increased staffing levels ahead of current output.

These explanations help to explain why productivity, as measured, has been weak, but of course, the
reduction in productivity in the data could also be described as a correction of previous mismeasurement of
output, as the previous negative externalities that are the object of the regulation were not fully captured.

The second theme is a change in business model or mix. Many firms are able to adapt to a change in the
type of business they operate over the long term, but still face challenges to their productivity during the
transition period. Productivity in ‘Financial services’ has probably been affected by the need to reduce
leverage and increase capital, limiting the potential return of certain activities previously deemed to be highly
productive (whether this was indeed the case once fully risk adjusted is less clear). This has had a knock-on
effect on a range of other professional services, such as ‘Legal and accounting’, where the mix of work has
shifted away from supporting such riskier activities. ‘Postal and courier services’, which accounts for about
8% of the aggregate productivity shortfall, has seen a substantial change in its business mix. There has been
a large rise in the processing of parcels and packages at the same time as a continuing trend decline in
conventional letters, to which the industry is still adjusting.

Another recurrent theme is a tough trading environment, which makes it harder for companies to win work,
or complete it effectively. This has depressed productivity as competition has led to more resources chasing
fewer new projects, while uncertainty has led to project delays, pushing up the number of average hours per
project. This is reported by companies in several sub-sectors that include professional services such as
‘Activities of head offices; management consultancy’, ‘Activities auxiliary to financial services and insurance
activities’ and ‘Legal and accounting activities’. It has also been a factor for ‘Warehousing and support
activities for transportation’ as the financial crisis has led to a consolidation of transport routes in airline and
shipping, as well as for the construction industry.
Labour retention is another common theme. As I mentioned in a speech last year,11 companies in a range
of sectors such as ‘Activities of head offices; management consultancy’, ‘Legal and accounting activities’;
‘Construction of buildings’ and ‘Electricity, gas and steam’ have held on to staff to avoid the high cost of
subsequent recruitment. This is particularly pertinent for some sectors, such as law and accounting, where
training times make it difficult to change the supply of staff at short notice.

Finally, the need to maintain a minimum operating scale is cited by companies in the ‘Warehousing and
support activities for transportation’, where transport infrastructure companies, in particular in airports and
ports, have low variable staffing costs relative to fixed staffing needs (e.g. the need to maintain air traffic
control numbers). This has also been true for other sectors, such as a banks or building societies, where the

11

8

desire to maintain a branch network or keep in place a distribution chain has forced companies to maintain a
core staff base.

Several of these themes, including a tough trading environment, minimum operating scale and skilled labour
retention combine for ‘Wholesale trade’, a sector mainly consisting of business-to-business transactions in
the manufacturing sector (including self-distribution by manufacturers to retail outlets), in which we have
seen relatively muted falls of employment compared to changes in output.

Finally, there is also some evidence that a high level of bank forbearance may have played a part in
depressing productivity the construction sector, allowing firms to continue to stay in business as demand was
collapsing.12

Clearly, some of these productivity drivers are closely linked to the business cycle, and are
“demand-contingent” while others are “non-cyclical”, which is not to say permanent. By characterising a
driver as “non-cyclical”, I simply mean that it does not depend primarily on a recovery in demand – I make no
tacit judgment about how long-lasting or permanent it might be. But even for those drivers that are closely
tied to the evolution of demand, there is no necessity that productivity will recover at the same pace as
demand. There could still be lags.

Nevertheless, a qualitative assessment of the relative importance of the demand-contingent and non-cyclical
nature of each of the sectoral narratives allows us to form a view on the degree to which supply might
respond to the strengthening of demand. It can therefore help inform our judgment about how rapidly the
output gap might be expected to close, as the upswing continues.
Drivers such as a tough operating environment, labour retention and minimum operating scale look to be
primarily “demand contingent”. As demand recovers and the volume of business increases, less time will be
spent bidding for new contracts, allowing employees’ resources to be re-deployed to more productive work.
In activities in which there has been labour retention or a minimum operating scale, increasing demand can
be met by the existing workforce.
Drivers such as stricter regulation and change in business mix are likely to be more “non-cyclical”. There is
little direct link with existing levels of demand, and as such, they are unlikely to be unwound in tandem with a
recovery in demand.
Bringing these together in Table 3, it appears that the cumulative contribution to the shortfall of those
divisions where the weakness of productivity is predominantly explained by non-cyclical drivers (which we
estimate at some 60%) is slightly greater than that of the divisions where weak productivity primarily reflects
demand-contingent drivers (40%).

12

See Arrowsmith et al. (2013).

9

Rather than simply allocating a demand-contingent or non-cyclical explanation to each division, we can apply
a judgment as to the relative weight of each by division. This alternative approach provides a similar result.
(Table 4). Using this method suggests that again, slightly more of the weakness of productivity over the past
six years has been non-cyclical (56%) rather than demand-contingent (44%).
Implications for policy

What are the implications of this for our understanding of the economy and for monetary policy?

The key issues currently facing the MPC are estimating the current level of slack, and the pace at which it
will be absorbed as the recovery develops. Assessing the pace at which slack is likely to be absorbed
requires a judgment on how much aggregate supply is likely to respond to increases in demand through a
recovery in productivity growth. Our current judgment, built in to the May Inflation Report forecast, is that
productivity will recover as demand strengthens, but that the rate of productivity growth over the next couple
of years is unlikely to materially exceed pre-crisis rates (Chart 3) – that is, supply will partially respond to the
pick up in demand, but the catch up in productivity levels over this period is likely to be limited. Nevertheless,
this gradual pickup in productivity means that, on the basis of the current forecasts for demand growth, the
absorption of slack over the forecast period slows relative to the recent past.

With roughly 40% of the productivity shortfall appearing to be “demand contingent”, my sectoral analysis of
the productivity puzzle broadly supports the MPC’s central view of a gradual recovery in productivity as the
economy recovers. Nevertheless, the fact that 60% appears to be unrelated to the cycle of demand also
suggests that some of the weakness may well be more persistent, and that a more rapid recovery in
productivity than currently expected over the next couple of years is perhaps hoping for too much. It is not
that this element of the productivity shortfall is necessarily lost forever, but that it might take some time to
reverse, and this will be driven by factors independent of the strength of demand.

Moreover, the analysis still leaves a good deal of uncertainty as to how rapidly and at what stage in the
recovery the recovery in productivity will appear, and this has significant implications for the judgment of how
fast slack is being absorbed and the timing of the eventual closure of the output gap. Both of these
estimations are particularly sensitive to small changes in either the pace of output growth or the pace of
productivity recovery through the forecast period.

The absorption of slack, which is central to the framework that underpins the second phase of forward
guidance, will continue to guide our decision making. But we must resist the temptation to demand too much
precision from such calculations of slack and the estimated relationship between slack and inflation
pressures. As I argued in a recent speech,

13

13

we will also need to be alert to signals of any build up in wage

See McCafferty (2014).

10

settlements and margin expansion – direct signals that the absorption of slack is beginning to affect price
pressures.

Faced with such uncertainties about the likely pace of absorption of slack, a prudent policy maker, in my
view, would want to start to remove some of the current extraordinary level of monetary stimulus a little
before the output gap is fully closed. But on this occasion, there is an additional reason not to hold back too
long. Once the normalisation of monetary policy gets underway, I believe it will be critically important that
rises in Bank Rate are delivered, as far as we are able, at only a modest, gradual pace. This will be
necessary to allow consumers and businesses, who are likely to be more than normally sensitive to changes
in interest rates in the early stages of the tightening cycle, to adapt without undue disruption to spending or
damage to confidence.

The decision on when it will become appropriate to begin the normalisation of policy is becoming more
balanced as the economy has strengthened through the early summer. As ever, our decisions on monetary
policy will depend critically on the evolution of the data over the coming months.

* Imputed rent is subtracted from ‘Real estate’ GVA because the income stream associated with the ownership of dwellings and other property is insensitive to employment. Removing imputed rent
brings the weight of ‘Real estate’ in total GVA to 2.9%, from 9.7% when imputed rent is included. ‘Other services’ refers to ‘Arts, entertainment & recreation’, as well as ‘Other service activities’.
Gaps calculated between 2007 and 2013Q4. For each sector, the productivity gap is calculated by subtracting the employment gap from the output gap, while the percentage point contribution to the
aggregate productivity gap is calculated by subtracting the employment gap times the employment weight from the output gap times the output weight. For any sector, when the output and employment
weights differ markedly, the sector’s contribution to the aggregate productivity shortfall may have a different sign than that sector’s own productivity shortfall would imply (e.g. Health & social activities).
Source: ONS and author’s calculations.
Output measured as sectoral Gross Value Added, available at http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-328821. Although the data are chain-linked, the annual
chain-linking methodology introduced in 2003 means that sectoral estimates do not aggregate to published totals before the base year, which is currently 2010 (see 'The effects of annual chain-linking on the
output measure of GDP'). As a result, the aggregate shortfall of 5% is not comparable with the expenditure-based aggregate published by the ONS. For employment, Workforce jobs data are scaled up by
the Labour Force Survey.
