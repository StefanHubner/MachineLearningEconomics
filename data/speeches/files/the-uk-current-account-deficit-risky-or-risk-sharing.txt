Historians have described the Suez Crisis of 1956 as a turning point in UK foreign policy – an event which
1

may have “dealt a final blow to Britain’s self-image as a world power to be reckoned with”. This experience
also highlighted the power of foreign investors to deal a “blow” to economies that are reliant on foreign
financing. This experience should provide a poignant reminder today. The UK is once again reliant on foreign
financing, the counterpart to its large current account deficit. Foreign financing can be fickle during periods of
heightened uncertainty and risk aversion. Is the UK vulnerable to another Suez-like crisis today? This
question has become more pertinent over the last few months as many measures of uncertainty for the
global economy, and especially the UK, increased. Or has greater financial globalization changed how we
should evaluate these vulnerabilities? Are large current account deficits and reliance on foreign financing
always “risky”? Or can they also provide an important form of international “risk-sharing” against some types
2

of shocks ?

Before answering those questions, let me back up to what happened during the Suez crisis. From the
beginning of 1956, the UK experienced moderate capital outflows and a steady loss of international
reserves. The UK government realized this was not sustainable. In September UK officials began
conversations to draw financial assistance from the IMF – a plan which initially received informal support
from the US (a key vote as it was the only country with veto power). In October the UK joined a military
campaign in Egypt aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal. Although the campaign met with minimal
resistance in Egypt, it generated a strong international backlash – including from the US. The military
campaign and international reaction increased the perceived risk of investing in the UK, sharply accelerating
UK capital outflows and reserve losses. The UK needed immediate financial assistance to avoid
a devaluation – an option viewed as untenable. But now the US blocked any financial assistance from the
IMF, unless the UK agreed to a full and immediate military withdrawal from Egypt. President Eisenhower
even told his Treasury Secretary to make plans to begin selling US holdings of UK sterling bonds. The UK,
constrained by its need to stabilize capital flows from abroad, felt it had no choice and quickly agreed to full
withdrawal from Egypt. It immediately received a large financial assistance package that the IMF described
4

as “linked to the financing of the current account” and the situation stabilized.
Fast forward exactly sixty years – and discussion is again focused on potential UK vulnerabilities due to the
country’s reliance on foreign financing. Over the 1 ½ years that I have been on the MPC, I can count on at
least one question on the current account deficit in almost every meeting, briefing, hearing, and speech.
These questions have recently become even more frequent given heightened uncertainty in the UK and
broader global economy, especially around sharp asset price movements since the start of the year.
And there is good reason to raise these questions. The headline statistics are alarming; the UK current
account deficit was 5.1% of GDP in 2014. This is the largest annual deficit in the 59 years that the ONS

“Risk sharing” refers to the potential insurance against country-specific shocks afforded by holding a diversified portfolio that includes
foreign assets and liabilities, thereby automatically sharing some domestic gains and/or losses internationally.

Boughton (2001). The UK had a small current account surplus in 1956, but the IMF described the financing as linked to the leads and
lags in payments linked to financing the current account.

reports data. It was also the largest of any of the advanced economies in 2014, a record the UK is expected
5

to hold again in 2015. A current account deficit must be financed by capital flows from abroad (a financial
account surplus) – basically through investment and borrowing from foreigners. Governor Carney recently
6

described this situation as the UK relying on “the kindness of strangers”. The IMF’s annual report on the UK
7

economy was just released this January and featured the current account deficit. Heightened
uncertainty – in the global and domestic economy – have all increased concerns about risks to the UK from
its current account deficit and reliance on foreign capital inflows.
But there are also compelling reasons why today’s current account deficit may not be alarming – and why
today’s situation is fundamentally different than in 1956. One factor behind today’s current account deficit is
the relatively stronger growth of the UK relative to its major trading partners, especially the euro zone, which
should not persist if the region’s recent stabilization continues. Broadbent (2014) highlights that a major
reason why foreigners have been willing to invest in the UK is its strong institutions – which should not
change. About 81% of net UK capital flows in 2014 were foreign direct investment, a more stable form of
financial flows than the “hot money” that is more likely to “suddenly stop” and generate a crisis. The UK net
8

international investment position (NIIP) is moderate by international standards and suggests there is room
for continued external borrowing before generating concerns about sustainability. The UK also has a flexible
exchange rate, which tends to better adjust to major shifts in capital flows than “fixed” exchange rates that
are suddenly abandoned (and that raised such concern in 1956).
All of these arguments why one should – and should not – worry about the UK current account deficit have
9

been made in other contexts and discussed at length, so I will not repeat them today. The Financial Policy
Committee at the Bank of England has done a stress test of the risks to the UK financial system related to
the UK current account deficit – important issues which I also will not discuss.

10

Instead, my goal today is to

reassess the UK’s international vulnerabilities linked to its current account deficit during periods when there
is a sharp increase in global or domestic risk – the types of events that can trigger sharp adjustments in
financial flows and currencies. The Monetary Policy Committee regularly evaluates how these types of risks
affect the UK economy, such as in the February minutes which discussed heightened global uncertainty
related to China and emerging markets, and in the March minutes which discussed heightened UK
uncertainty related to the upcoming EU referendum.

11

My analysis today explores how these types of risks

related to heightened uncertainty can affect fast-moving international capital flows and the valuations of

February’s Monetary Policy Summary discussed how recent global market volatility seemed “in part to reflect greater weight being

Summary mentioned “increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union” and
that it “is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling.”

international investments. It is not intended to analyse the longer-term impact and vulnerabilities that would
occur if uncertainty is elevated for an extended period or there are structural changes – as I will not discuss
the slower-moving adjustments that would likely occur over these longer periods through channels such as
trade, savings, consumption and business investment.

To perform this assessment, it is necessary to delve into the various financial channels that determine
international vulnerabilities.

12

In the UK, international investment income has recently been more important

than trade in explaining movements in the current account; movements in exchange rates and the returns
and capital gains on different international asset and liability positions can be substantial. Heightened risk
and uncertainty can not only lead to challenges financing a current account deficit, but also affect the
exchange rate, the relative returns that foreign and domestic investors earn, and the valuation of any
international borrowing and investments. These financial effects related to the current account deficit are
substantially larger today than in past decades due to the higher degree of financial globalization.
Depending on why risk and uncertainty increased, and how this interacts with a country’s pattern of
international borrowing and lending, current account deficits can aggravate — or mitigate — the negative
economic impact of increased risk and uncertainty on an economy.

Applying this analysis to the UK suggests that sterling tends to depreciate during periods of heightened UK
and global risk, and the interactions of weaker sterling with the UK’s international asset and liability positions
can generate improvements in the UK’s international investment position and current account – even without
any adjustment in trade. This automatic risk sharing tends to be larger during periods of heightened UK risk
than after periods of heightened global risk, although it is unlikely that this situation could persist for an
extended period of heightened UK uncertainty (as investors would require compensation). Moreover, the
magnitude of this risk sharing is moderate, so that even though it reduces vulnerabilities related to the
current account deficit and international investment position, it is unlikely to fully mitigate the negative impact
of heightened risk and uncertainty on the broader UK economy.

The remainder of my comments will be divided into four parts. First, I will discuss reasons to be concerned
about current account deficits. Second, I will suggest how we should broaden our analysis of these
vulnerabilities by incorporating the effects of cross-border investment income (which directly affects the
current account) and cross-border financial exposures. Third, I will use this framework to analyze how
increases in global and UK risk could interact with these financial vulnerabilities linked to the current account
deficit. Finally, I will summarize what factors are important in determining whether a current account deficit in
these scenarios is more likely to be “risky” or “risk-sharing”. My comments draw on a longer and much more
detailed analysis written with Ida Hjortsoe and Tsveti Nenova – two colleagues at the Bank of England.

Are Current Account Deficits A Concern?

Current account deficits (and the corresponding borrowing from abroad) are a healthy outcome in many
standard economic models. Even a large current account deficit should not automatically be a cause for
concern. For example, in a standard endowment economy model, a country which experiences a negative
shock and fall in output (such as from a natural disaster) should borrow from abroad and run a current
account deficit in order to smooth consumption. Classical economic models show that an optimal allocation
of global capital implies that capital should flow from developed economies with low marginal returns to
developing economies with higher marginal returns, thereby generating current account deficits in the latter.
Various models incorporating demographic trends also show current account imbalances as an optimal
solution, as countries with older populations should save less, drawing down assets and generating a current
account deficit (balanced by earlier surpluses). Many sovereign governments have certainly believed that
running a current account deficit and borrowing from abroad was an optimal policy to finance warfare – such
th

as in the 14 century when Edward III of England invaded France with the help of loans from Italian bankers.
I will refrain from commenting on whether this was an “optimal” policy from the viewpoint of England or the
global economy.

The historical experience with current account deficits, however, suggests that they are often not benign.
Investors have tended to focus on current account balances as a proxy for a country’s reliance on external
financing and corresponding vulnerability to any increase in risk aversion or economic uncertainty. This
relationship between current account deficits and country vulnerability gained substantial attention during the
1997 Asian crisis. Figure 1 graphs the current account balances of 12 major Asian emerging markets in
1996 (before the crisis began). The 6 countries on the left of the graph (with the largest current account
deficits) all experienced a sharp currency depreciation of over 10% in 1997 (in red) and some also received
an emergency financial package from the IMF (in light red). None of the six countries on the right (with the
smaller current account deficits or surpluses), received an emergency package or experienced such a sharp
depreciation. Although this is clearly not a scientific study, it is not surprising that many investors concluded
that large current account deficits indicate vulnerability.

This focus on current account deficits as a proxy for country vulnerability during periods of heightened risk
has continued since then. During the spring of 2013, concerns increased about China’s growth and the
US Federal Reserve Board began to discuss “tapering” its asset purchases. Measures of global risk (such
as the VIX) increased sharply and investors quickly withdrew capital from emerging markets. The sharpest
capital outflows (and corresponding depreciations and increases in borrowing costs) occurred in countries

Figure 2 shows the relationship between currency depreciations

(relative to the dollar) over the window of the greatest volatility from May 1 to June 30, 2013 and countries
with current account deficits at the end of 2012. There is an almost 70% correlation – without controlling for
any other country characteristics. Highlighting this obsession with current account deficits as a badge of
country vulnerability, the group of major emerging markets under the sharpest investor scrutiny during this
period earned the moniker “The Fragile Five” – despite sharing little in common other than their large current
account deficits and corresponding reliance on external financing.

Formal academic work suggests that large current account deficits and reliance on external financing can
present risks – but these risks are more nuanced than a direct link from the size of a current account deficit
to a country’s vulnerability. Using the framework in Obstfeld (2012), this literature can be broadly divided into
three (related) concerns about a current account deficit: (1) increasing a country’s vulnerability to the
“sudden stops” in capital flows that correspond to crises; (2) leading to a deterioration in a country’s net
international investment position (or NIIP) which can make investors question the solvency of a country; and
(3) reflecting unsustainable macroeconomics that will eventually require a “reversal” and corresponding
difficult adjustment.

The first strand of literature focuses on the fact that large current account deficits need to be funded through
financing from abroad. Intuitively, any country running a current account deficit is sending more money
abroad than it is earning – through buying imports, paying returns on past investments, or outflows of other
payments such as remittances. The country must finance this shortfall of funding through a financial account
surplus – i.e., net financial inflows from foreigners – through means such as selling debt and equities, bank
loans, more inward FDI, and/or selling accumulated international reserves. The academic literature shows
that domestic or external shocks which cause a “sudden stop” in this external funding correspond to tighter
financial conditions, currency depreciations, slower growth, higher interest rates, increased probability of
debt crises and systemic banking crises.

15

There is also evidence that there is a lower probability of a

sudden stop if the current account is financed by a larger share of capital flows that are more stable (such as
FDI), that incorporate automatic risk sharing (such as equity), or that correspond to investors with a longer
time horizon.

16

Perhaps most important, this literature has also shifted away from focusing on net financial

flows (which net out gross inflows from foreigners less outflows from domestics) and instead focusing on
gross capital inflows as a measure of vulnerability.

17

The second strand of literature on the vulnerabilities related to current account deficits focuses on the
external borrowing required to fund current account deficits and corresponding deterioration in the net
international investment position (NIIP), which is basically cross-border assets less liabilities. Some
academic papers have found a significant link between increased current account deficits, deteriorating NIIP
positions, and a country’s vulnerability, but a majority of studies finds that these links are not significant or
robust.

18

This undoubtedly reflects the challenges in determining a country’s solvency, which would require

incorporating additional factors such as: expected growth, the composition and liquidity of the international
assets and liabilities,

19

the currency denomination of the borrowing, the country’s ability to print its own

currency, the country’s willingness to repay, etc. Although there is general agreement that large external
liabilities increase vulnerability and cannot grow infinitely, assessing exactly when net external borrowing
becomes a significant vulnerability is a challenge.

The third and final strand of literature focuses on whether current account deficits correspond to underlying
macroeconomic imbalances (such as low productivity growth, excessive consumption or investment, inflated
asset prices, or an unsustainable fiscal deficit) that will require a “reversal” in the current account. Reversals
require a shift in a country’s production and consumption profile that generally correspond to reduced
domestic demand, currency depreciation, higher inflation (through imported goods), increased foreign15

In a literature survey, Frankel and Saravelos (2010) find that current account deficits are significant in predicting currency crises and
vulnerability – but not as powerful as other variables (such as exchange rate appreciation and reserve accumulation). Other key studies
documenting these links are: Edwards (2005), Freund and Warnock (2007), Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2011), and Gourinchas and
Obstfeld (2012).
16
For evidence, see Forbes (2013) and Forbes and Warnock (2014).
17
Forbes and Warnock (2012) first develop this approach of focusing on gross capital inflows and outflows by foreigners and domestics,
rather than net capital flows, to analyse country vulnerability to sudden stops. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2010) also highlight the
importance of looking at gross flows during the recent crisis, and Avdjiev, McCauley and Shin (2015) highlight the role of gross flows in
banking.

currency denominated debt, and other difficult adjustments. The academic evidence on the characteristics of
these types of reversals is not uniform, but suggests that they can be costly and usually correspond to
“demand compression (i.e., reduced imports and domestic demand) rather than increased exports.

20

An

earlier vein of this literature also argued that 5% was a threshold after which a painful current account
reversal was significantly more likely, but there is now general agreement there is no “magic number”.

21

Most recently, several papers have highlighted an important link between these three literatures focusing on
different vulnerabilities related to current account deficits: rapid domestic credit growth.

22

These papers find

that it is the rapid increase in domestic credit (which often corresponds to large current account deficits,
capital inflows from abroad, and a deterioration in the NIIP position) that has the greatest explanatory power
in predicting crises. It is the end to this unsustainable credit growth and borrowing from abroad that
corresponds to the “sudden stop”, “reversal”, and painful adjustment in consumption, investment, demand,
exports, imports, inflation and growth.

This recent focus on credit growth as a key link between current account deficits, capital inflows, external
liabilities, and financial crises highlights an important shift in the literature on current account vulnerabilities –
away from focusing on trade and instead focusing on the corresponding financial flows. This does not mean
that trade is unimportant in the vulnerabilities and adjustments related to large current account deficits.
Instead, this shift highlights the growing importance of financial channels due to increased cross-border
financial exposures, as well as the much more rapid adjustments that occur through financial channels than
through trade. The remainder of my comments will build on this shift – adding additional issues related to
these financial flows that should be incorporated in any analysis of vulnerabilities related to current accounts.

II.

Incorporating International Financial Exposures and International Investment Income into
Vulnerability Analysis

One reason for paying greater attention to the financial flows and financial positions linked to the current
account is the increase in financial globalization since the early 1990s. Figure 3 shows the sharp increase in
cross-border financial assets and liabilities that has occurred over this period, broken out by the type of
exposure.

23

Cross-border financial exposures increased rapidly from about 1990 through 2007, and have

roughly stabilized since. This recent stabilization largely reflects a reduction in cross-border financial flows,
primarily in international bank flows.

Even if cross-border financial flows do not return to

Figure 3: World* financial assets and liabilities (%

their pre-crisis levels, the past accumulation of

of world GDP)

international assets and liabilities implies that
international financial exposures are likely to remain
substantially elevated relative to past decades. This
increase in cross-border financial exposures has two
important implications for vulnerabilities related to the
current account deficit: for net international investment
positions and international investment income. Before
showing these relationships – and their importance in
assessing vulnerabilities related to current account
deficits – it is helpful to begin with some basic
terminology.

* Sample includes all countries with data on financial assets and
liabilities going back to 1970.
Source: Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007b), IMF International Financial
Statistics and World Economic Outlook, and own calculations.

A. The Basic Framework
The net international investment position (NIIP) of country i at time t can be defined as its holdings of foreign
assets (A) net of foreign liabilities (L), for all asset/liability categories (c), such as FDI, portfolio equity,
portfolio debt, bank lending, and “other”, with all variables expressed in domestic currency:
𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑐(𝐴𝑐𝑖,𝑡 − 𝐿𝑐𝑖,𝑡 ) .

25

(1)

Any change in the NIIP can be decomposed into: changes in flows (captured in the current account, CA);
changes in the valuation of existing investment positions (∆𝑉𝐴𝐿); and other adjustments to the value of
international assets or liabilities that are not otherwise included (OAdj), such as data revisions or adjustments
related to the relocation of headquarters:

26

∆𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐶𝐴𝑖,𝑡 + ∆𝑉𝐴𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑂𝐴𝑑𝑗𝑖,𝑡 .

(2)

The current account is a function of the trade balance (TB), net primary investment income (INVINC), and
net secondary investment income (SECINC) the last of which is small for most countries:
𝐶𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑇𝐵𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑆𝐸𝐶𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 .

27

(3)

25

This decomposition used here is similar to that in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001, 2007a) and Devereux and Sutherland (2010). See
Forbes, Hjortsoe and Nenova (forthcoming) for more details on this framework.
26
Note that other adjustments also include the effect of real GDP growth on the past NIIP (the “denominator effect”). See Lane and
Milesi-Ferretti (2005) and Lane (2015) for information on this OAdj term.
27
The trade balance includes trade in goods and services; net primary investment income is the return from past investment in financial
assets and production processes (largely dividends and interest); net secondary investment income is basically personal transfers,
international assistance, charities and some inter-government payments.

Combining equations (2) and (3) yields:
∆𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑇𝐵𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 + ∆𝑉𝐴𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 ,

(4)

where 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 denotes secondary income and other adjustments to the NIIP. I will focus on the role of investment
income and valuation effects. These tend to be large, important, and fast moving – and therefore critical to
assessing a country’s vulnerability.

In order to assess this vulnerability, it is necessary to further decompose these investment income flows and
valuation effects. The equations quickly get complicated – so I have relegated them to the Appendix. The
bottom line is that it is fairly straightforward to show (with some algebra) how a country’s investment income
flows and valuation effects are determined by four sets of variables: the nominal rate of return on last
period’s stock of foreign assets and liabilities (excluding exchange rate effects), the rate of capital gain on
external assets and liabilities (by category), last period’s stock of international assets and liabilities, and the
exchange rate index reflecting the currency composition of the country’s assets and liabilities. All variables
are calculated for each asset and liability class (c) – including exchange rate indices for each asset and
liability category depending on what currencies in which they are denominated. These details are important
to fully capture the dynamics of how different types of shocks will affect the NIIP and current account.

B. Valuation Effects and the NIIP Position
How important are these financial effects (through valuation changes and investment income) relative to
trade in explaining changes in the NIIP position?

28

Figure 4a uses the decomposition in Equation 4 and

reports the share of the variance in the NIIP position from 1980-2014 that is explained by the trade balance,
investment income, and valuation effects for a large sample of around 180 countries and then for the UK.

29

Valuation effects play a significant role –and appear to be even more important than trade. More specifically,
valuation effects explained 35% of the share of the variance of changes in the NIIP for the full sample,
relative to 25% for trade and 8% for primary investment income. The role of valuation effects is even greater
in the UK on an absolute basis and relative to trade – where they explain 45% of the variance compared to
only 10% for trade.

Even more striking is how this role of valuation adjustments has increased over time. Figure 4b repeats the
same analysis, but only focuses on the “financially-globalized” period from 2004 to 2014.

30

The role of

valuation effects in explaining the variance in the NIIP is substantially greater – reaching 61% for the full
sample and 144% in the UK. This increased role is not surprising given larger international financial
exposures, especially in the UK. Larger international financial exposures mean that a given change in the
valuations of (as well as the returns on) these positions could have a larger influence on the NIIP. Concerns
28

Key papers highlighting the importance of larger international exposures and valuation changes on NIIP positions are: Gourinchas
and Rey (2007), Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006), Obstfeld (2012), Gourinchas, Rey and Treumpler (2012), Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2012), and Benetrix et al. (2015).
29
The shares do not add to 100% due mainly to covariances between the components, as well as to other smaller components and data
issues that are not reported to simplify the comparisons.
30
The key results reported below are similar if we vary the start and end dates or exclude the recent crisis.

valuation changes.

But what causes these valuation changes? The decomposition in equation (A1) in the appendix suggests
that these valuation effects will be determined by four factors: the existing stocks of international assets and
liabilities, differences in exchange rates across assets and liabilities, differences in capital gains across
assets and liabilities, and differences in the composition of the portfolio (shown by c). The equation shows
that these factors (and their relationships) can generate changes in the NIIP even if the initial net financial
position is zero.

31

Existing international stocks play an important role because they determine the magnitude

of the impact of capital gains and exchange rate movements on the NIIP. Gross positions matter. The
exchange rate plays a particularly important role, both through its direct impact on the value of net foreign
assets, but also because it can mitigate or emphasize the impact of capital gains on the NIIP. Accurately
measuring the different exchange rates for different asset and liability classes (if their currency denomination
differs) is critically important to capture the corresponding valuation effects. This is explained in more detail
at the end of the appendix.

Differences in capital gains across specific asset and liability categories, as well as different portfolio
compositions across assets and liabilities, are also important. To show these effects in a simple example,
assume that there are only two countries – the UK and euro zone – and their only cross-border investment is
in equities, of which they both hold the same amount. If UK economic growth is expected to pick up faster
than in the euro zone and this is reflected by improvements in UK equities (relative to those for the euro), this

For example, if capital gains on assets increase faster than capital gains on liabilities, or if the exchange rate associated with assets
depreciates more than that associated with liabilities, then the inherited asset position (in domestic currency) increases, even if the net
position is zero.

would lead to negative valuation effects on the UK NIIP (as foreigners holding UK equities would experience
larger capital gains than UK citizens holding foreign equities). Or – as an example of the effect of portfolio
composition – now assume equities yield the same returns in each county, but each country can also invest
in some debt (which also yields the same in each country). UK citizens choose to hold more equities than
debt, and euro investors hold more debt than equity. If equities yield higher capital gains than debt (as they
traditionally do over long periods of time), then this would generate positive valuation effects on the UK NIIP
– even with no difference in returns between the countries for each asset category – simply because UK
investors hold riskier portfolios.

Which of these channels for valuation effects (international stocks, exchange rates, capital gains or
composition effects) has been most important? The answer varies by country, depending on the country’s
portfolio of international assets and liabilities and changes in exchange rates and capital gains. Figures 5a
and 5b provide this breakdown for the UK, using two different decompositions of these channels since
1991.

32

Figure 5a breaks down valuation effects into the impact of: initial stocks, exchange rate movements,

and capital gains (including other effects). Exchange rates have been a key driver of valuation effects,
contributing around 43% of the average annual valuation change (in absolute value) for the UK. Exchange
rate effects generated significant improvements in the UK’s NIIP during the crisis (as sterling depreciated),
but in 2014 sterling’s appreciation generated a significant decline in the NIIP. Capital gains have also played
an important role, with the average magnitude of these effects roughly equal to that of overall valuation
changes over this period. These price effects were large and negative in 2009 during the crisis.

Figure 5b provides a different decomposition in order to better understand these prices effects. The figure
breaks down valuation effects into the impact of: initial stocks, composition effects and return effects. The
capital gains in Figure 5a incorporate aspects of both of the latter effects, while the exchange rate effect from
above is folded into the composition and return effects. Figure 5b shows that an important factor contributing
to the capital losses in 2009 was composition effects. This reflects that the UK had a portfolio with riskier
assets (such as equities) and relatively safer liabilities (such as debt), combined with larger capital losses at
this time on riskier investments. In most years, different rates of return (which incorporate exchange rate
effects) for the same asset/liability classes were even more important determinants of valuation effects. The
stock effects from initial international exposures on valuation changes tend to be smaller than the other
effects in each of these decompositions.

32

We perform these different decompositions due to the challenges in isolating each of these channels, combined with data limitations.
For example, the data on capital gains incorporates a mix of different returns for each asset and the composition of the portfolio, while
the exchange rate effects incorporate interactions with the exchange rate movement and the returns and composition of the portfolio.

Notes:
(a) The total valuation change is calculated as the change in the NIIP stock adjusted for the net capital flow during each period. The
initial stock effect measures the valuation change that would have resulted from the initial NIIP imbalance if both assets and liabilities
generated the same capital gain. The exchange rate effect takes into account the different currency composition of foreign assets and
liabilities. The 'capital gains and other' bars are the residual which captures capital gains in the currency of denomination of assets and
liabilities, but might also reflect revisions to the volume of international portfolios that are not reflected in the capital flows.
(b) Each of the subcomponents in this decomposition includes the effect of exchange rate movements. The composition effect captures
the excess valuation change stemming from the different composition of assets and liabilities. The return effect captures any excess
return from assets over liabilities within each asset class.

C. Investment Income and the Current Account
Just as any assessment of current account vulnerabilities should consider valuation changes on the NIIP. It
should also consider financial effects through the investment income component of the current account. This
link has been largely ignored in the literature and analysis of current account vulnerabilities (unlike for
valuation effects) – possibly due to the common shortcut of treating the current account balance as being
equivalent to the trade balance. Figure 6 shows, however, that this shortcut is not valid. It graphs current
accounts for the 15 OECD countries with the largest current account deficits over 2013-2014 and breaks the
deficit into its three components shown in Equation (3): trade, primary income (the largest component of
which is net investment income) and secondary income. Large current account deficits are clearly not
synonymous with large trade deficits; investment income balances can also be significant determinants of
current account balances. In fact, the primary investment income balance constitutes a larger share of the
current account deficit than trade in a number of countries – including South Africa, Colombia, Peru, Brazil,
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Chile and Mexico. For just 2014, the UK investment income deficit (at 1.8%) was almost as large as its trade deficit (at -1.9%).

But, even if investment income is important in

explaining the levels of some countries’ current
account deficits, is it also important in explaining
changes in current accounts? This may be even
more important for any analysis of vulnerabilities
related to sudden stops and reversals in current
accounts. Figure 7 performs this analysis by
showing the share of the variance in the current
account that is explained by the variance of
trade, primary investment income and secondary
investment income (as specified in Equation 3)
for a large sample of countries and the UK.
Figure 7a is for the full period from 1980-2014,
while Figure 7b just focuses on the last 10 years
(from 2004-2014). The figures show that trade
accounts for more of the variance in the current
account than investment income for the full

sample of countries in each of the windows. The
estimates for the UK, however, indicate that this

can vary substantially over time in individual countries. In the UK, trade explained 87% of the variance in the
current account over the full period – about twice as much as explained by investment income. In contrast,
over the last ten years the relative importance of these components has basically reversed, with investment
income recently explaining twice as much of the variance in the current account as trade.

This increasingly important role of investment income in explaining movements in the UK current account is
even more striking when viewed over time, as shown in Figure 8. This graphs the 10-year rolling correlation
of the UK’s current account balance with the trade and primary investment income balances since 1989. In
the 1980’s and 1990’s, movements in the UK current account almost perfectly corresponded to movements
in the UK trade balance. This correlation fell throughout the 2000’s and during the crisis, and is now
negative. In contrast, the correlation between the UK’s current account deficit and primary income balance
has increased sharply since the early 2000’s and is now close to one.

33

This transition is striking and

suggests that movements in the UK current account balance have recently been driven almost entirely by
changes in investment income, with little impact of changes in trade. Treating the current account balance
as a trade balance is clearly no longer appropriate.

Figure 8: 10-year rolling correlation between UK

But what drives these changes in investment

current account balance and its net trade and

income? The decomposition in equation (A2) in

primary income components

the appendix suggests that investment income will
equal the returns received on assets from abroad
(the first term) less the returns paid on liabilities
held abroad (the second term). Two main sets of
variables determine these values: the existing
stocks of international assets and liabilities
adjusted by the exchange rate, and differences in
returns denominated in local currency across
assets and liabilities. Differences in returns could
result from different returns on the same type of
asset or liability, or a different composition of
assets and/or liabilities. Investment income will be

Outlook and own calculations.

greater for: (a) a larger stock of foreign assets

relative to liabilities (which could also result from a larger depreciation of the exchange rate associated with
assets relative to that associated with liabilities); and (b) higher local-currency returns on assets relative to
liabilities (which could result from differences in returns within each asset category or different portfolio
compositions). These relationships are similar to those discussed above for valuation effects on the NIIP
(and in the appendix). For example, gross positions and the different exchange rate movements (on assets
and liabilities within asset classes) matter for both. The composition of assets and liabilities is also important
in both; even if returns and exchange rates are identical within each asset class, and the overall assets and
liabilities net out, a different asset composition across assets and liabilities could affect investment income as
well as capital gains.

33

The pattern of a lower correlation of the current account with the trade balance and higher correlation with the income balance is
unchanged if we use a shorter rolling window of 5 years to exclude the financial crisis from the latest data point.

Which of these potential drivers of investment income has traditionally been most important? The answer
varies across country, but Figures 9a and 9b break down UK investment income into the same categories as
used in Figures 5a and 5b. Figure 9a shows that exchange rate movements explain a smaller share of
investment income than for valuation effects (in Figure 5a). Decomposing the variance in the UK’s
investment income over the full period using the framework in Figure 9b, 69% of the variance can be
explained by return effects, 10% by composition effects and 2% by the initial stocks. Perhaps most
interesting, from 2000 to 2008 the UK consistently earned positive net investment income on its international
portfolio. Figure 9b shows this was due to its composition of assets and liabilities (with a higher share of
foreign assets in riskier investments), as well as higher returns within each asset category. These positive
returns, however, reversed briefly during the crisis, then started falling sharply around 2012 and have
remained negative ever since. The recent investment income deficit is driven primarily by negative relative
returns; within each asset category (such as FDI), UK investors are earning less than foreign investors are
earning in the same asset category in the UK. A large share of this reflects the relatively stronger economic
performance, exchange rate, and corresponding returns in the UK relative to the euro area.

D. Tying it All Together: Implications for Country Vulnerability Related to Current Account
Deficits
The analysis above suggests that any analysis of vulnerabilities related to current account deficits should no
longer just treat the current account deficit as a trade deficit, but also incorporate an analysis of the
investment income component of the current account. Similarly, any analysis of vulnerabilities related to the
16

16

corresponding NIIP should no longer treat this as an accumulation of current account balances, but also
incorporate an analysis of valuation effects on the NIIP. In extreme cases, this type of thinking could even
overturn some of our current understanding of the vulnerabilities related to the current account. For
example, does the evidence suggesting that larger current account deficits increase the probability of having
a “sudden stop” in capital flows still hold if the current account deficit is caused more by a deficit in
investment income than trade? Or if a large current account deficit does not reflect any macroeconomic
imbalances, but instead changes in investment income due to external shocks, is the current account less
likely to “reverse” and cause a difficult economic adjustment? And should we be less concerned about any
solvency risks from a large negative NIIP position if it is stabilized due to positive investment income flows?

To make this point, Figures 10a and 10b show the evolution of the NIIP in the United Kingdom and United
States. The dotted blue lines graph cumulated trade deficits (relative to GDP) since 1980 – and show the
sharp deterioration in the NIIP position that would have occurred if trade balances (instead of current account
balances) corresponded to the financial account and there had been no valuation changes on the NIIP. The
green lines show the cumulated investment income balance and the red lines the cumulated valuation
changes on the NIIP. Both are positive and have substantially improved the actual NIIP positions (the black
lines) relative to the cumulated trade deficits. These financial effects through international investment
income and valuation effects have improved the UK and US NIIP positions by about 10% and 20% of GDP,
respectively. These are meaningful improvements and show how these financial affects have the potential to
influence assessments of country solvency.
But it is also important to note that these effects could work in the opposite direction and weaken a country’s
NIIP position relative to what it would have been without these financial effects. For example, Figures 10c
and 10d show the same analysis for Sweden and Spain. Sweden would have a positive NIIP position if this
only captured cumulated trade surpluses. Instead, large negative valuation adjustments and primary income
deficits over much of this period have generated a small negative NIIP over this window. The large negative
NIIP position in Spain, which has generated substantial concern about the country’s solvency, is due as
much to deficits on investment income and negative valuation effects as to a trade deficit.

To summarize, when assessing country vulnerabilities related to current account deficits, it is no longer
sufficient to simply assume that the deficits are mainly driven by changes in the trade balance and will
translate directly into changes in the NIIP. Instead, it is necessary to take a closer look at the financial
component of the current account balance (the investment income balance) and the role of valuation
changes on international assets and liabilities in affecting the NIIP. These financial components may
generate a meaningful deterioration – or improvement – in current account balances and NIIPs. Therefore,
understanding how these financial components respond to various shocks – and especially the types of
shocks that correspond to increased concerns about current account deficits – is critically important to
understanding these vulnerabilities.

III.

An Application: UK International Vulnerabilities during Heightened Domestic and Global Risk

To see how this broader framework of thinking about vulnerabilities related to the current account works in
practice, it is useful to consider what it implies during a period of heightened risk and uncertainty.

34

Research

34

I will use the words risk and uncertainty interchangeably in the following discussion, although in many frameworks they capture two
distinct concepts – changes in risk aversion and economic uncertainty.
18

18

over the last few years has highlighted the strong relationship between changes in risk (as usually measured
by the VIX) and sudden shifts in capital flows and the broader global financial cycle in credit growth and
leverage.

35

I will consider increases in two types of risk: domestic and global. Heightened domestic risk

could reflect any increased uncertainty about the evolution of the UK economy or anything that makes UK
consumers, businesses and investors in the UK more “risk averse”, including uncertainty in the run-up to any
election or referendum. Heightened global risk could reflect any increased uncertainty about the evolution of
the global economy or anything that makes global investors, consumers and businesses more risk averse –
including concerns about China and other emerging markets.
My main focus will be to assess how heightened risk, when interacted with the composition of the UK’s
international investment position and current account, could aggravate UK vulnerabilities – or partially
mitigate them through international risk sharing.

36

To simplify the analysis and focus on these financial

effects, I will make three simplifications. First, I will ignore any effects through the trade balance. Not only
have these relationships been well studied elsewhere, but trade can take a number of months to adjust,
while the financial channels on which my comments are focused adjust more rapidly. Second, I will assume
that global risk has no differential effect on the local-currency returns for a specific asset category across
countries. For example, I will assume heightened global risk has the same effect on equity prices in the UK
and US (ignoring any exchange rate effect) – and thereby not attempt to assess how changes in risk might
have differential effects on the real economy and outlook for production, dividends, etc. in different countries.
I will, however, allow changes in risk to affect the return differentials between different asset categories (such
as between equities and debt).

Finally, I will assume that increases in both types of risk cause sterling to depreciate. This is a noncontroversial effect of increased domestic risk. Whether sterling depreciates after increased global risk,
however, depends on whether sterling is considered a “safe-haven” currency. The correlation between the
VIX and sterling (which would be positive if sterling behaved as a safe haven) fluctuates over time, and there
are some windows when sterling has behaved like a safe-haven currency.

37

Figure 11 reports the 60-day

rolling correlations between the VIX and sterling, the euro, and the three main safe haven currencies (the US
dollar, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen) over different time periods. This graph indicates, however, that
sterling has not behaved like a safe haven currency recently or over longer periods of time. The correlations
with the VIX are negative for sterling over the last 60 days, 3 years, and 10 years – and provide a sharp
contrast to the positive correlations over each window for the traditional safe haven currencies (with mixed
results for the euro). Moreover, the negative correlation between sterling and the VIX is even stronger during
larger increases in the VIX. This suggests sterling is even less likely to be treated as a safe-haven currency
during the periods of sharply higher global risk, which generate the greatest concerns about the stability of
35

For evidence on the relationship of risk: with capital flow movements, see Forbes and Warnock (2012, 2014), with bank lending, see
Bruno and Shin (2015), and on the global financial cycle, see Rey (2013) and Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015).
36
See Gourinchas, Rey and Truempler (2012) for calculations of the amount of risk sharing through net international investment
positions during the crisis. They estimate large effects. For example, they calculate that the US transferred $2,200 billion in wealth
transfers abroad from 2007q4 to 2009q1, while the UK had a net gain of $542 billion between 2007q4 and 2008q4.
37
For example, during the euro crisis in 2011-2012, the VIX and sterling-euro exchange rate were positively correlated.

capital flows to finance current account deficits. Therefore, based on historic relationships, it seems safe to
assume (yes – pun intended) that sterling would be likely to depreciate during a period of sharply higher
global risk and uncertainty.

changes in selected exchange rate indices and

Let’s start with a negative domestic shock which
increases UK risk and uncertainty. The financial
impact on the NIIP will depend on how this increase in
risk works through the various channels affecting
international valuations and investment income
discussed earlier. Forbes, Hjortsoe and Nenova
(forthcoming) work through these calculations, and
Figure 12 summarizes some of the key channels –
focusing on those that are more intuitive, larger in
magnitude, and correspond more closely to the
analysis in Section II. The left-hand column lists the
main variables that will determine how heightened
domestic risk influences both valuation effects and the
broader NIIP (which also includes investment
income).

39

effects of this shock by transmitting wealth

The second column describes what country characteristics ensure that this type

of international risk sharing occurs through changes in the NIIP.

40

The third column then assesses whether

the UK has these characteristics that can mitigate the negative effects from heightened domestic risk, with a
 indicating risk sharing and an X indicating no risk sharing. The final column on the right includes
comparable statistics for other OECD economies.
This figure suggests that the UK’s international portfolio has a number of characteristics that would be
expected to generate some risk-sharing in the face of a negative domestic risk shock. In particular, the 31%
share of UK borrowing in the form of equities suggests that when heightened domestic risk has the usual
impact of causing a decline in domestic equity prices, some of these losses are shared with foreign
investors. This share of borrowing in equities has increased notably from its average of 26% from 1990 to
2015, thereby increasing international risk sharing through this channel, although it is still lower than the
average for 9 other OECD economies with floating exchange rates. Even more important, however, has

38

Since the impact on valuations is qualitatively similar to that as on the full NIIP, I will focus on the key characteristics that would lead
to an improvement in the NIIP after an increase in domestic risk.
39
To simplify, I do not include additional channels that are harder to quantify, such as the hedging ability of the exchange rate relative to
capital gains and returns.
40
We focus on the main determinants of interest, but not their interactions. For more details and the full derivation of the points made in
the table, see Forbes, Hjortsoe and Nenova (forthcoming).

been risk sharing through the currency denomination of UK assets and liabilities. With 90% of assets
denominated in foreign currency and only 60% of liabilities, any heightened UK risk that causes sterling to
depreciate will – all else equal – generate an improvement in the NIIP simply because it increases the value
of the assets held by the UK relative to the value of what it owes to foreigners.

Next, Figure 13 repeats the same analysis for the impact of heightened global risk. This is more complicated
than for domestic risk because it requires taking into account that some currencies are “safe-havens” and
appreciate in response to increased global risk, while others tend to depreciate. It also requires
incorporating changes in capital gains (excluding currency movements) not only on liabilities, but also on
foreign assets. Finally, the rush to safe assets globally after increased global risk would cause the return on
debt liabilities relative to the return on equity liabilities to fall less than when just domestic risk increases.
Incorporating these considerations with the UK international position, yields the key variables listed in the left
column of the figure as most important to assess the impact of increased global risk on the UK NIIP.

This table suggests that in the presence of heightened global risk, the characteristics of the UK external
position could partially mitigate the impact on the NIIP – although the case is less clear-cut than after
heightened domestic risk. The UK’s relative composition of assets and liabilities (in the first row) is basically
balanced and therefore indicates little risk sharing through this channel; this is an improvement relative to the
last 25 years (during which the composition of UK assets was, on average, riskier than for liabilities and

implied an amplification of negative global risk shocks). Risk sharing does occur, however, through
exchange rate effects interacted with the different exposure to safe haven currencies in assets and liabilities.
With 43% of assets in safe haven currencies, and 26% of liabilities, this implies that when global risk
increases and safe-haven currencies appreciate, UK international assets would increase relative to liabilities
and boost the NIIP. This channel will provide some risk sharing to the UK in the presence of heightened
global risk, but no more than the average for the other 9 OECD countries in the comparison in the right

Although Figures 12 and 13 show that most characteristics of the UK external position should help mitigate
the negative impact of heightened domestic and global risk on UK international exposures, it does not
provide any information on the magnitude of any such risk-sharing through these channels. Therefore – as a
final step – I estimate an SVAR model that can be used to calculate how UK and global risk shocks have
affected the relative returns on UK foreign assets and liabilities over time.

46

Figure 14 shows the resulting

43

The ratio of UK equity assets to debt assets has been relatively stable over the last decade. But the ratio of equity liabilities to debt
liabilities (averaging 35% over 1990-2015) has increased recently (to 45%) because of higher inward direct investment flows.

The shocks are extracted by estimating a Bayesian SVAR with sign and zero restrictions on quarterly UK data on yields and capital
gains on foreign assets and liabilities, UK and US interest rates, UK and US uncertainty measures, growth in the UK relative to the rest
of the world and the sterling trade-weighted exchange rate. The identification scheme assumes that a global risk shock is associated
with a rise in the VIX index, a fall in US one-year forward interest rates, and no change in UK risk relative to US risk. A UK-specific risk

historical contributions of these UK and global risk shocks to the total relative returns on the UK NIIP. These
two shocks only explain a moderate portion of these relative returns – which would be expected as they only
include the impact of two types of shocks; the model does not attempt to capture the wide array of other
influences that would affect relative returns (such as monetary and fiscal policy or anything that affects
relative growth rates). The estimated effects of increased global and domestic risk do, however, show
several noteworthy patterns and trends.

improvement in relative UK returns – as expected.
As discussed above, this is because the yield and
capital gains on UK liabilities (i.e., what the UK
pays foreigners) decreases as risk in the UK
increases, while the yield and capital gains on UK
assets (i.e., what the UK earns on foreign
investments) is unaffected. This effect is magnified
by sterling’s corresponding depreciation. A
depreciation increases the value of UK foreign
assets (which are worth more when converted from
foreign currency into the weaker domestic
currency), but has less effect on UK liabilities (a
relatively greater share of which are denominated
in domestic currency). These effects work in the

opposite direction during periods of reduced UK
risk, however, such as in 2013-2014. During this

period, UK domestic risk fell and sterling appreciated, reducing UK net foreign returns in 2013 and shifting
wealth abroad. There is not yet enough data to estimate the effects of the most recent period of heightened
UK risk and corresponding sterling deprecation, at least some of which is likely related to the EU
47

referendum.

Our results suggest, however, that any such increase in domestic risk and associated sterling

depreciation would likely be to improve the net total returns on the UK’s NIIP. (Of course, this simple
analysis does not consider the separate impact of any capital outflows or other longer-term economic effects,
which could easily offset these positive valuation effects.)

Moving to the global risk shock, an increase in global risk has historically been associated with a fall in the
total returns on UK assets relative to the returns on its liabilities. This corresponds to the above discussion
that UK foreign assets have been riskier than its liabilities over most of the period in the analysis. For

shock is assumed to increase relative UK uncertainty and lead to a sterling depreciation, but has no effect on US risk or interest rates.

instance, in the years just before the crisis from 2005 to 2007, low global risk was associated with higher
returns on UK assets (which tended to be riskier) relative to on UK liabilities, contributing to positive gains in
the NIIP position and current account. In contrast, the sharp increase in risk aversion in 2008/9 had a
negative impact on the net returns of the UK NIIP – as the returns on its riskier assets plummeted (relative to
the returns on its safer liabilities). Unfortunately, data is only available through Q3 2015, so it is impossible
to estimate the impact of recent global market volatility and uncertainty on the net total returns on the UK’s
external asset position. Given the recent shift in the composition of UK assets and liabilities (towards higher
equity liabilities relative to debt liabilities), however, the negative impact of a rise in global risk on UK net
foreign wealth is likely to be lower today than estimated for previous episodes.

IV.

Conclusions

The UK current account deficit has been on the radar screen of policy makers and investors over the last few
years as it deteriorated from -3.3% of GDP in 2012 to -5.1% in 2014. Current account deficits of this
magnitude can increase a country’s vulnerability to a sudden stop in capital flows and correspond to a
difficult economic adjustment as the deficit “reverses.” However, characteristics of the UK economy and the
factors behind the deterioration in its current account deficit could indicate less vulnerability than suggested
by the headline statistics. My goal today has been to reassess these vulnerabilities in the face of any sharp
increase in global risk and uncertainty (such as occurred earlier this year linked largely to China and other
emerging markets) as well as in the face of any increase in UK risk and uncertainty (such as can occur in the
run-up to an important vote). Do vulnerabilities related to the UK current account deficit increase in the face
of increased global or domestic risk? Or could financial channels linked to the current account provide a type
of risk-sharing that mitigates any negative impact on the UK?

To answer these questions, it was necessary to extend the standard analysis of vulnerabilities related to
current account deficits to incorporate a series of financial channels. Most analysis tends to treat current
accounts as being synonymous with trade balances, and thereby not incorporating how financial flows and
financial adjustments can mitigate – or aggravate – the risks related to large current account deficits. For
example, most analysis ignores the fact that income on past international investments can now be even
more important in determining changes in the current account than trade flows – as has recently been the
case for the UK. Movements in exchange rates and the relative returns on international assets and liabilities
can also generate substantive shifts in current account balances and international investment positions –
shifts which are critically important in assessing vulnerabilities. These forces have become much more
important today, especially in the UK, due to greater financial globalization. The dynamics of international
financial adjustment have fundamentally changed relative to the days of the Suez crisis.

The analysis shows that these international financial channels (and especially the currency composition of its
international positions) play an important role in how UK international financial vulnerabilities are affected by
heightened global and domestic risk. The UK has historically experienced net capital losses and lower
returns during periods of heightened global risk – although this effect may change due to recent shifts in UK

cross-border portfolios (with a greater share of liabilities in the form of risk-sharing FDI and equities). On the
other hand, the UK has historically experienced net improvements on its international exposures during
periods of heightened UK risk; the current composition of UK cross-border portfolios suggests that this risk
sharing should continue and help mitigate any negative impact of increased domestic risk on UK
international exposures.

Of course, this should not be taken to suggest that heightened domestic risk does not present any concerns
for the broader UK economy. This risk sharing primarily occurs through changes in the valuations of
international exposures, which would have minimal impact on domestic incomes and growth.

48

Much of the

adjustment occurs through sterling depreciation – which would in itself incur other adjustments – and its
impact on inflation would need to be evaluated based on the factors behind the depreciation.

49

For example,

if a depreciation resulted from heightened uncertainty corresponding to a short-term increase on risk
aversion, there would be less impact on UK inflation than if the uncertainty corresponded to weaker UK or
global supply (such as through reduced investment). Perhaps most important, the estimated magnitude of
this potential risk sharing through international exposures is moderate and would be unlikely to fully
counteract the many negative effects from increased uncertainty on the broader UK economy. This is
especially true over longer periods of time. This analysis only focused on adjustments through fast-moving
financial channels and does not make any attempt to model the longer-term, real adjustments that would
occur through slower-moving channels, such as trade. Similarly, by focusing on these shorter-term
adjustments, it does not encompass the effects of a prolonged period of heightened uncertainty on the cost
for the UK to borrow in sterling; investors would likely also adjust and this could lead to changes to the
current structure of the UK’s international investment portfolio.

What are the implications of all of this for monetary policy? Not much in terms of my vote this month.
Instead, the point of this analysis was to better understand UK vulnerabilities related to its current account
deficit in different scenarios of heightened UK or global uncertainty. There is no shortage of events – both
today and in the future – that could prompt this type of increase in risk and uncertainty. Better understanding
how this vulnerability could evolve in the UK, and especially how these dynamics have changed over time, is
an important part of sound policymaking.
And finally, the answer to the other question you have all been waiting for – the question with which I began
my comments. Is the UK current account deficit “risky” or “risk-sharing”? It is both.

See, for example, Carroll et al. (2011) and Case et al. (2013) for some recent estimates.
See Forbes, Hjortsoe and Nenova (2015), which shows that the shock behind an exchange rate movement will determine the impact
on import prices and inflation.

Appendix: Additional Decomposition of Valuation Effects and International Investment Income

Forbes, Hjortsoe and Nenova (forthcoming) use the same terminology and framework developed in Section
II.B, to show that the valuation effects (∆𝑉𝐴𝐿) and primary international investment income (𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶) can be
further decomposed into:
∆𝑉𝐴𝐿𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑐 [

𝐴𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1

𝐴,𝑐
∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡

𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑐 [

𝐴,𝑐
𝐴,𝑐

. The exchange rate is defined

as the cost of one unit of domestic currency in units of foreign currencies so that the exchange rate falls
(increases) when the domestic currency depreciates (appreciates).

The exchange rate plays a particularly important role in assessing the role of valuation effects and
investment income, both through its direct impact on the value of net foreign assets (which affects valuation
gains and investment income), but also because any movements in the exchange rate might mitigate or
emphasize the impact of capital gains on the NIIP. Accurately measuring the various exchange rates for
different asset and liability classes if the currency denomination differs is critically important to capture the
corresponding valuation effects.

Consider the broad-based depreciation of sterling following the financial crisis between 2007 and 2009. Had
the UK’s proportion of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency been identical, the exchange
rate indices on assets and liabilities would have moved symmetrically. Because more assets than liabilities
were denominated in foreign currency, however, the exchange rate on assets depreciated more than the
exchange rate on liabilities – increasing the value of those assets and reducing the negative impact of the fall
in capital gains. That is, through its impact on the valuation on assets, the depreciation increased the NIIP.
The depreciation, however, had the opposite impact on the liabilities side; it increased the value of liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, and mitigated the fall in capital gains on liabilities. But given that more of
the UK’s foreign assets than liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, the exchange rate on assets
depreciated more than the exchange rate on liabilities. Therefore – given similar capital gains and initial
positions across assets and liabilities – the broad-based exchange rate depreciation had the effect of

increasing the return on assets more than the return on liabilities. Overall, the depreciation contributed
positively to the NIIP through the valuation channel.

Figure A1 shows that although these different

at times. It shows the standard exchange rate
index for the UK calculated using the standard
formulation of trade weights, as well as the
financial-weighted exchange rate index for UK
assets and liabilities. From 2007q1 to 2009q1, the
exchange rate on foreign assets depreciated by 7%
more than that on liabilities. Conversely, from 2013
to 2015, the exchange rate on foreign assets
appreciated by more than that on foreign liabilities,
contributing to the deterioration in the NIIP position,
investment income (and therefore current account)
over this period.
