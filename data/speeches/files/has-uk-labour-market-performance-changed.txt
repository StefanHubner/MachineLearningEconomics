1. Introduction

In the late 1980s, unemployment (ILO measure) fell from 11.2% in 1986 to 7.2% in 1989.
Over the same years, inflation (GDP deflator) rose from 3.5% to 7.1%. In the late 1990s,
unemployment fell from 10.3% in 1993 to 5.5% in 2000. However, inflation, also fell from
2.7% to 1.7% over the same period.

In 1998, around 2.3 million men of working age (excluding students) were classified as
economically inactive. That is, neither employed nor looking for work. Twenty years
previously, this number was only 400 thousand.

In 1979, the proportion of employees who were trade union members was over 50 percent.
Today this number is below 30 percent and, in the private sector, below 20 percent.
In 1975, earnings at the 90th percentile of the pay distribution were less than three times
earnings at the 10th percentile. By 1996 this multiple had risen to nearly four times.

All these facts are indicative of big changes in the UK labour market in the last quarter of the
20th Century. In what follows, we look at some of the forces underlying these changes and
briefly touch on their implications for policy. In the next section we look more closely at the
interaction between monetary policy and the labour market. Then in Sections 3 and 4, we
analyse the recent history of UK unemployment and the forces underlying its substantial
decline over the last decade. In Section 5 we focus on inactivity rates and then in Section 6
we consider the growth of some significant imbalances in the UK labour market. We
conclude with a summary and some final remarks.

2. The Labour Market and Monetary Policy
One way of looking at the setting of monetary policy is by noting that to stabilise inflation, it
helps if real demand is kept in line with potential output.

Given the lags in the system, this

must be done in a forward looking manner. In order to do this, it is vital to keep track of
potential output. For example, a ceteris paribus increase in the growth rate of potential output
will typically require a temporary loosening of monetary policy. The growth rate of potential
output may be split up into four parts as follows1:

2

Potential output growth = trend labour productivity growth +
growth of the working age population
-

the trend rate of change of the inactivity rate

-

the rate of change of the equilibrium unemployment rate.

Trend labour productivity growth is the trend rate of growth of output per employee, the
inactivity rate is the proportion of the population of working age neither working nor looking
for a job and the equilibrium unemployment rate is the rate consistent with stable inflation,
sometimes termed the NAIRU.

The operation of the labour market impacts on all four of the elements of potential output
growth. The first, namely trend productivity growth, depends crucially on the rate at which
skills are accumulated. The growth of the population of working age is mainly determined by
demographic changes but it is also influenced by net migration. Both equilibrium
unemployment and the extent of inactivity directly reflect the performance of the labour
market. In what follows, we focus on these last two factors, although we may occasionally
comment on some implications for productivity growth. We begin by looking at the recent
history of equilibrium unemployment.

3. The Recent History of Unemployment in the UK
Before going into detail about recent shifts in equilibrium unemployment, it helps to set the
scene if we have some idea of the history of unemployment in post-war Britain. In Figure 1,
we show the path of unemployment since 1960, using the standard ILO definition (that is, an
unemployed person is someone without work who is actively searching for work and is
available to take up a job)2. We can see that unemployment started to move gradually
upwards in the late 60s and early 70s, surging upwards rapidly after the first oil shock in
1974, again after the second oil shock in 1979, came down rapidly in the Lawson boom of the
late 1980s and rose equally rapidly after 1990. Since 1993 it has gradually subsided so that
by 2000 it reached its lowest level since the 1970s.

Note: These data refer to the ILO rate back to 1984. Prior to that, the data are based on OECD standardised
registered unemployment rate (see Layard et al., 1994, Annex 6, Table A3 for details).

To get some understanding of these fluctuations, let us consider the period since the
mid-1980s. In 1986, unemployment had been in excess of 11 percent since 1982. By
the Spring of 1990, it had fallen below 7 percent. This dramatic fall was produced in
part by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, in part by an international boom and
in part by a large fall in commodity prices in the mid-1980s. So why did the fall in
unemployment come to an end? Basically because inflation, as measured by the rise
in the price of UK output (GDP deflator), rose from 2.5 percent per annum in 1986 to
7.6 percent in 1990. Indeed during one month in 1990, the headline RPI rate reached
double figures. Furthermore, by 1990, the trade balance was in deficit to the tune of 4
percent of GDP.

Anxiety about these trends had set in by 1988 and the short term interest rate rose
from around 8 percent in the Spring of 1988 to 15 percent by the Winter of 1989.
This tightening of monetary policy had its effect on inflation and unemployment after
1990 and by 1993, unemployment had risen to over 10 percent with GDP price
inflation falling to 2.7 percent. Again by 1992, the government was getting anxious
about rapidly rising unemployment and once the UK had left the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism, monetary policy loosened with short rates falling from over 10 to
around 6.5 percent during 1992. Unemployment then started to fall and from 1994,
GDP inflation started to rise, peaking in 1996. Since 1996, we have been in the
benign state of falling unemployment and stable or gradually falling inflation.
However, the balance of payments deficit has been gradually worsening since 1997.

What does this story reveal? Basically it is consistent with a standard open economy
natural rate view of the world. Thus, if economic activity gets too high and
unemployment gets too low, inflation starts to rise. If unemployment gets too high,
inflation starts to fall. So we define equilibrium unemployment as that level which is
neither too high nor too low and which is thus consistent with stable inflation. This
equilibrium level is sometimes called the ‘natural rate’or the NAIRU3. In practice,
things are a bit more complicated because a high exchange rate can act to suppress
inflationary pressure essentially by enhancing the effective level of foreign
competition facing UK firms as well as by making imports cheaper. So, if the
exchange rate is high, which usually shows up in the form of a larger trade deficit, this

may prevent inflation rising even if unemployment is below the equilibrium rate.
Formally, what this means is that there is a three way trade off between
unemployment, changes in inflation and the balance of payments. If unemployment is
below the equilibrium rate, either inflation rises and there is no balance of payments
deficit or inflation is stable and there is a payments deficit or there is some
combination of the two (see Layard et al., 1991, Chapter 8 or Nickell, 1990). So here
we define the equilibrium rate as that consistent with stable inflation and a zero
balance of payments deficit.

Despite its name, the equilibrium unemployment rate may change quite significantly
from one decade to the next. How and why it might have changed we shall discuss
below. What is important to understand here is that, broadly speaking, it cannot be
changed by monetary policy. This simply influences the way in which actual
unemployment fluctuates around the equilibrium rate.

Finally, although it is easy enough to talk about equilibrium unemployment, pinning
down the number is less straightforward. Basically, it is influenced by any factor
which systematically influences inflationary pressure in the labour market at a given
level of unemployment. For example, changes in the power of trade unions, the
operation of the benefit system, the match between the skill requirements of job
vacancies and the available skills of unemployed job searchers, labour taxes, product
market competition, minimum wages can all change the equilibrium rate.
Furthermore, changes such as these do not act on the equilibrium rate instantaneously.
Individual behaviour takes time to adjust to changes in the economic environment, so
that the impact of changes of the type listed above on the equilibrium rate will tend to
emerge gradually over a number of years.

4. Recent Changes in the Equilibrium Unemployment Rate
The easiest way of estimating the equilibrium unemployment rate is to take the actual
rate and make a downward (upward) adjustment if inflation is falling (rising) or if the
balance of payments is in surplus (deficit). The calibration of the size of the
adjustment must be generated by some estimated model. In Table 1 we present some
estimates of the equilibrium rate based on this method for various periods since 1969.

6

We use periods of at least four years in order to smooth out year to year fluctuations.
As we can see, for the most recent four year period, equilibrium unemployment is
estimated to be 5.7 percent. Although it should be recognised that there are
considerable uncertainties surrounding this number. Over the period 1997-2000, the
average level of actual unemployment is above this and the balance of payments is in
deficit which is consistent with the falling rate of inflation. In fact, in the most recent
year (2000), unemployment has fallen below 5.7 percent but this has not been
associated with rising inflation because the high level of the exchange rate has helped
to suppress inflationary pressure. In 2000, this was associated with a payments deficit
of around 2 percent of GDP.

Unemployment refers to the ILO rate, inflation to the GDP deflator. Potential GDP
refers to actual GDP corrected for unemployment fluctuations. The equilibrium rate
is calculated exactly as described in Layard et al. (1991), pp. 442-5 or Nickell (1990).
As well as adjusting for inflation changes and the payments deficit, there is also an
adjustment for unemployment dynamics.

Notes: Prior to 1990, the values of inflation changes and the trade balance are lagged
one year and two years respectively to account for the time taken for these factors to
feed into unemployment. After 1990, we use current values because the reaction of
unemployment to economic conditions increased in rapidity.

7

For our purposes, the key feature of Table 1 is the steady decline in the equilibrium
unemployment rate from its peak level of the 1980s, a decline which accelerated in
the second half of the 1990s. The obvious question is what has brought this about.
And the obvious place to look for an answer is at the workings of the labour market.
Before going into detail, it is worth recalling that we should not expect shifts in the
operation of the labour market to impact instantaneously on the equilibrium rate. As
is well-known, it takes a considerable time for individual and organisational
behaviour to respond fully to changes in the economic environment. That said, we
shall now investigate successively changes in industrial relations, the benefit system,
labour taxes, the introduction of a National Minimum Wage and the extent of
competition in the product market.

Changes in the system wage determination

In most European countries, the majority of employees have their wages determined
by Trade Union collective bargaining. In those countries where this bargaining
operates in an uncoordinated and adversarial fashion, this tends to generate upward
pressure on inflation at given levels of labour market slack leading to higher levels of
equilibrium unemployment4. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Britain was one such
country. For a variety of reasons, which include the Trade Union Legislation
introduced in the 1980s, the structure of wage determination in Britain has changed
dramatically over the last 20 years. This is reflected in the numbers presented in
Tables 2 and 3.

These data reveal that the proportion of workers covered by Trade Union collective
agreements has halved from its peak of 70 percent in 1980 and this decline has almost
been matched by the fall in union membership. Looking at the private sector alone,
which is the driving force behind wage inflation5, we see that by 1999 membership is
down below 20 percent.

with only a small minority of private sector workers being covered by collective
agreements. During this process, wage bargaining, even in the unionised part of the
private sector, has become far less adversarial. Indeed the number of strikes is
currently minimal relative to the level of disputes two decades ago.

How has this change, which is almost unique in its scale among OECD countries,
come about? Two factors are important. First, the Trade Union legislation of the
1980s moved the balance of power in disputes away from employees and made it
harder for unions to organise. This made it less easy and attractive to join a union.
Second, the heavily unionised sectors of the economy have been in relative decline
over the whole period (except for the public sector). This process is exemplified by
the numbers presented in Table 4. These show clearly how, in the private sector,
newer establishments set up after 1980 are far less likely to be unionised than those
set up before 1980.

So as old establishments are replaced by new establishments, unionisation
inescapably diminishes. This is almost the whole story. Derecognition in continuing

10

plants is very rare (see Machin 2000, Table 2). So whatever these changes have
meant for the working conditions of the average employee, there seems no question
that they have contributed to the decline in inflationary pressure at given levels of
labour market slack and hence to the fall in equilibrium unemployment6.

Changes in the benefit system

There are four aspects of the benefit system which influence equilibrium
unemployment. These are, in turn, the level of benefit, the duration of entitlement,
the coverage of the system and the strictness with which the system is operated. In
Tables 5, 6, 7 we present a partial picture of how the system has changed over the
years. In Table 5, we see that the actual level of benefit relative to earnings has
declined quite rapidly since the late 1970s, basically because of the abolition of
earnings related supplement and the switch of indexation from an earnings basis to a
price basis introduced by the first Thatcher administration.

Underlying these broad brush changes have been numerous detailed shifts set out in
Table 6 which have reduced the coverage of the system and increased its operational
strictness. The former effect is made clear in Table 7. All these changes have made
unemployment a less attractive state than work, which will have had a gradual impact
on equilibrium unemployment.

A small digression is in order here to point out that simply because a change in the
benefit system reduces equilibrium unemployment, it does not necessarily imply that
it is a good thing. It is arguable, for example, that the current system is simply too
mean. In fact, to have a system which operates well, it is not necessary to plunge
households into poverty should the sole breadwinner lose his or her job.

13

The system as operated in Denmark, for example, was substantially reformed in the
early to mid 1990s, not by reducing the generous level of benefit (replacement rates
close to 70 percent of gross earnings) but by providing a system of job search
assistance allied to a set of sanctions to be applied if individuals do not fulfil their
responsibilities to look for and accept work. These reforms have underpinned the
excellent performance of the Danish labour market in recent years (current
unemployment around 5 percent).

In any event, desirable or otherwise, the overall thrust of changes in the benefit
system in the UK have undoubtedly contributed to the fall in equilibrium
unemployment reported in Table 1. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that this and the
changes in trade unionism are the most significant factors.

The role of employment taxes

The taxes that are important in the labour market are those which form part of the
wedge between the real cost of labour per employee facing firms and the real post-tax
consumption wage facing workers. This is important because if any tax which is part
of this wedge rises, then either workers get poorer or labour costs go up and
employment falls. So, to the extent that workers resist falls in their living standards,
employment will fall. The taxes which contribute to this wedge are payroll taxes,
income taxes and consumption taxes. There is considerable debate on the extent to
which changes in these taxes are absorbed by wage changes or end up impacting on
employment (see Nickell and Layard, 1999, for a summary and evidence). The
overall conclusion is that a small part of the tax change may impact on employment
and this might have helped reduce equilibrium unemployment since the early 1980s
because the tax wedge has fallen slightly since that time. The contribution reported in
Nickell and Van Ours (2000) is just over ½ percentage point.

The National Minimum Wage (NMW)

While the introduction of the NMW in April 1999 was obviously irrelevant for the
reduction in equilibrium unemployment since the 1980s, looking forward it could play
a role. The evidence from other countries is that for minimum wages set at relatively

14

low levels (such as the UK level), the employment effects are minimal except perhaps
for young people in those countries which do not have a special low rate for the under
21s. (See Dolado et al. 1996 for a good summary). The evidence we have so far in
the UK confirms this (see Machin et al. 2001, for a particularly reliable analysis). So
while the existing NMW strategy continues, we should not expect significant effects
on equilibrium unemployment from this direction.

Product Market Competition

In a world where wages are determined by bargaining, increases in produce market
competition will tend to reduce equilibrium unemployment and raise the share of
labour in total output. Many have argued that there has been a significant rise on
competition in the UK over the last 20 years and most businessmen would agree.
Forces pushing in this direction include privatisation, deregulation and declining trade
barriers both within Europe and in the World at large. On the other hand, these same
forces have also generated a great deal of “restructuring” in many of the affected
sectors which has, in many cases, had the effect of sustaining and even concentrating
market power. Until the strengthening of the UK anti-trust system on 1st March 2000,
when the 1998 Competition Act came into force, competition law was quite feeble,
particularly relative to that ruling in the US. This perhaps explains why the share of
profit in the business sector of the economy has not exhibited any significant trends in
the UK over the last 30 years7 (see Figure 2) and why many internationally traded
branded goods are so expensive in the UK despite the “high” exchange rate which
makes imports cheaper.

It is worth noting that following the sharp rise in the exchange rate in 1996-98, UK
firms operating in international markets have been under particular competitive
pressure which has impacted on margins in recent years and helped suppress UK
inflation. My previous remarks concern the longer term trends in market power and
competition, not to short or medium-term fluctuations due to exchange rate shifts.

15

Inflationary expectations

Before moving on to discuss inactivity, it is worth remarking on a particularly
important feature of the operation of the labour market which has been most helpful in
recent years, namely the low level and stability of inflation expectations. In Figure 3,
we present the RPI inflation expectations of trade unions since these will be
particularly relevant to wage bargaining. As can be seen, since the introduction of
inflation targeting after Britain’s exit from the ERM in 1992, Trade Union inflation
expectations have gradually subsided and are currently relatively stable. This stability
is, in a sense, a public good because it enables the economy to operate in a more
stable fashion. Thus if the economy is hit by a shock, its impact will be much greater
if the shock influences inflation expectations. For example, in the period from the
beginning of 1999 to the middle of 2000, the oil price rose from around $10 to around
$30 a barrel. Had this been incorporated into inflationary expectations, the nominal
and then the real macro economic consequences of the shock would have been far
more significant. As it is, the macroeconomic consequences appear to have been
minimal. This expectational stability is arguably a consequence of the structure of
monetary policy determination and it has played a significant role in helping to
suppress wage inflation despite the historically low levels of unemployment we are
currently enjoying.

5. Recent Changes in Inactivity Rates
The other key part of the impact of labour supply on potential output growth is the
rate of change of the inactivity rate. Inactivity is, in some respects, more important
than unemployment because there are vastly more people in this category. So the
number of potential workers among the inactive is substantial and this could,
therefore, have a potentially significant impact on potential output growth. In
practice, however, the inactivity rate among non-students has remained remarkably
stable over the last twenty-five years (see Table 8). It is important to recognise that
the inactive are not as cut off from the labour market as the name suggests. Overall,
some 4 percent of non-student inactive individuals actually get jobs every quarter8.
This compares with around 23 percent of the unemployed (and 14.8 percent of
inactive students). So the inactive are a source of potential labour supply but they are
very different from the explicitly job-seeking unemployed.

The inactivity rate refers hers to the total number of individuals of working age who
are not students and who are neither working nor unemployed, as a proportion of the
non-student population of working age.

Source: Labour Force Survey, Spring Quarter, Gregg and Wadsworth (1999).

Underlying the stability of the inactivity rate among non-students is a dramatic
contrast between men and women. Since 1975, the percentage of non-student men of
working age who are inactive has risen by more than 5 times, around a 10 percentage
point increase. By contrast, this is almost offset by a nearly 10 percentage point
decline in the inactivity rate of women. These are dramatic changes indeed and
reflect quite a number of such effects which underlie the calm macroeconomics of the
UK labour market. These we pursue in the next Section.

6. Imbalances in the UK Labour Market

The most important changes in this context are the improving position of women
relative to men and of the skilled relative to the unskilled. So let us start with the
situation of women relative to men.

Imbalances between the sexes
The main point here is that women are catching up. In Table 9, we present
information on employment rates and relative pay rates. The basic picture is of the
employment rates of men and women coming together and the relative (hourly) pay of
full-time women rising substantially. This has not happened for part-time women.
The pay gap is closing in part because qualification rates have been rising faster from
women than men and partly because women are improving their rewards relative to
men for the same qualifications. For example, by the mid 1990s, the proportion of
younger (25-34) full-time women with degrees was higher than for men, whereas the
number of part-time women with degrees was only one-third as great. These changes
have been driven partly by the impact of the anti-discrimination legislation of the
early 1970s and partly as more and more employers recognised that it was silly to
throw away profits by making it hard for women to enter and progress in their firms.

Given that women are improving their position relative to men, let us return to the
changes in inactivity noted in Table 8 and see if we can shed some more light on the
startling differences between men and women portrayed there. We can start by
looking at the reasons for inactivity set out in Table 10. For men, the majority of
inactivity is caused by sickness and disability, particularly among the prime age
group. In this group, the majority of inactive women report themselves as looking
after home and family. For older workers, sickness, disability and early retirement are
very important for both men and women. This suggests that we should investigate
further the role of sickness and disability, but before doing so, we should look at
another major imbalance, that between low and high skill workers.

Imbalances by skill

It is well known that over the last two decades, individuals with higher qualifications
have improved their situation dramatically relative to those with low or no
qualifications. This is partly because of the bias of technical change in favour of the
skilled and partly because changes in the pattern of international trade has favoured
skilled workers in the developed countries (see, for example, Berman et al. 1998 and
Wood, 1994). Thus in Britain, the wage differentials between those with high
qualifications and those with no qualifications rose substantially between the 1970s
and the 1990s despite the significant increase in the numbers of the former relative to
the latter (see, for example, Machin, 1999, Tables 11.4, 11.5). This suggests that, for
the skilled versus the unskilled, there has been a significant increase in the relative
demand relative to the relative supply. This may be expected to have an impact on
both unemployment and inactivity rates which favours the skilled. This is indeed
precisely what has happened as Tables 11 and 12 indicate.

In Table 11, we see how the unemployment rates for men have worsened dramatically
for men with no qualifications (around one quarter of the population of working age).
Interestingly, this has not happened for women, yet another example of the relative
improvement of their labour market situation.

In Table 12, we see that inactivity rates for men without qualifications have risen
enormously so that by 1998, almost one-third are inactive. To obtain some idea of
what is going on here, we look at the sub-group of the inactive men who are sick or
disabled. In Table 13, we show the percentage of the population of working age who

23

are inactive because of sickness or disability. We divide both by age and educational
qualification and we see some remarkable numbers. For those without qualifications,
aged 25-54, the proportion of the male population who are inactive because of
sickness or disability has increased from 3.1 percent in 1979 to 18 percent in 1998.
Even more startling is the fact that this number has doubled since 1993 during a
period when unemployment was falling and the overall economy was buoyant. This
is one of the key factors underlying the rise in male inactivity over the last twenty
years.

A further aspect of these dramatic changes is the difference across regions. As we can
see from Table 14, inactivity rates are much higher in high unemployment regions
than they are in low unemployment ones, indicating that this is a demand as well as a
supply side phenomenon.

24

The implications of these imbalances

We started out this part of the paper by noting that overall inactivity rates had barely
changed over 25 years. So, as far as aggregate potential output has been concerned,
changes in inactivity have not been an issue. But underlying this picture of calm,
there have been the most dramatic shifts.

Women have been catching up with men and the demand for unskilled men has all but
collapsed. In areas of high unemployment, less than half the men with no
qualifications are working and a large proportion of these would be classified as sick
or disabled. One of the lessons of all this is that the inadequate education and training
received in the past by a significant part of the population has not only been disastrous
for them personally but has meant that the UK economy has been made significantly
poorer by not making use of their potential. The benefits to the economy overall as
more women have chosen to work have been more or less cancelled out, at least in
numerical terms, by the steady withdrawal of men from the labour force.

25

Summary and Conclusions

A key part of the process of making monetary policy is to understand the forces
underlying the growth of potential output. This divides naturally into productivity
growth and the potential growth of employment. Given that population growth is
mainly a function of demographics, the potential growth of employment depends
crucially on trends in unemployment and inactivity. The former are those nonworkers looking for a job whereas the latter are the non-workers not looking for a job.
Interestingly enough quite a number of this last group nevertheless end up in
employment, although a lot fewer than from the unemployed.

In this paper we have analysed the forces underlying trends in unemployment and
inactivity. Our main results are as follows:

i)

The main factors underlying the fall in equilibrium unemployment over the
last twenty years have been the decline in Trade Unions, particularly in the
private sector, and the fall in generosity and increase in strictness of the
benefit system. The small fall in employment taxes, changes in product
market competition and the introduction of the National Minimum Wage have
had a minor impact.

ii)

The inactivity rate among the non-student population has barely changed since
1975. This stability, however, masks enormous changes, since the inactivity
rate among men of working age has risen by around 10 percentage points over
this period (a multiple of 5 times!) and this entirely offsets the large falls in
inactivity among women.

iii)

Underlying the rise in inactivity among men have been dramatic increases
among the unskilled so that by 1998, around 30 percent of non-student men of
working age without qualifications were inactive. Even more dramatic is the
fact that most of these are inactive because of sickness or disability, even those
who are not elderly. For example, in 1979, around 3 percent of men aged 2554 without qualifications were inactive because of sickness or disability. By

26

1998, this number had risen to 18 percent. The corresponding number for
those with degrees is 1 percent.

iv)

The incidence of inactivity is much higher in high unemployment regions than
in low unemployment regions. Thus, in the high unemployment regions of the
North-East and North-West, more than half the men aged 25-64 without
qualifications are not in employment. This indicates that this is not just a
supply-side phenomenon.

More formally, if Y* is potential output, POP is the population of working

ia is the inactivity rate, u* is the equilibrium unemployment rate (NAIRU),

To be more precise, they must have searched actively for work within the last
four weeks and must be able to start work within the next two or they must be
waiting to take up a job already obtained.

3.

I prefer the equilibrium rate. The natural rate is misnomer, since there is
nothing natural about it and it can be systematically changed by some types of
policy. NAIRU is a misnomer because it should be the constant inflation rate
of unemployment, that is non-changing not non-accelerating.

4.

For detailed evidence on this issue see, for example, Nickell, 1997. Many
heavily unionised countries in Europe, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and
Norway have systems of collective bargaining which enable the parties to the

27

bargain to take account of the macroeconomic consequences of the agreements
they strike. This has helped them to achieve low levels of unemployment.
Such co-ordination was attempted in Britain in the late 1970s with only
limited success because the institutional framework was simply not up to the
task.

5.

Evidence suggests that most public sector wages follow the lead of the private
sector, often with a considerable lag.

6.

The rough and ready numbers reported in Nickell and Van Ours (2000)
suggest that this factor has made the most important contribution to the decline
in equilibrium unemployment.

7.

This is also the case in the US. Interestingly enough, the share of profits has
risen substantially in Continental Europe over the last 15 years, perhaps
indicating a weakening of competition.

Summary
Has UK Labour Market Performance Changed
by Stephen Nickell

1.

Why has wage inflation not taken off despite the fact that unemployment is at
its lowest level for a generation?

The answer is that the level of unemployment consistent with stable inflation (the
NAIRU) has fallen substantially since the 1980s.
2.

Nickell’s estimate of the level of unemployment consistent with stable
inflation for the period 1997-2000 is 5.7 percent (on the ILO basis). The
reason why inflation is not rising even though unemployment is currently
below this level is the fact that the high level of the exchange rate is
generating further downward pressure on inflation at the expense of a
substantial trade deficit.

3.

The main factors underlying the fall in the NAIRU over the last twenty years
have been the decline in the role of Trade Unions and their more co-operative
nature, particularly in the private sector, and the fall in generosity and increase
in strictness of the benefit system. The small fall in unemployment taxes,
changes in product market competition and the introduction of the National
Minimum Wage have not played a serious role.

4.

While the unemployed are a significant part of potential labour supply, a more
important group in this regard are the inactive (those who are neither
employed nor seeking work). The proportion of the non-Student population of
working age who are inactive has barely changed over the last 25 years
(around 19 percent).

31

5.

Underlying this stability are some remarkable changes. The proportion of
inactive men has risen by around 10 percentage points and this has been offset
almost exactly by the 10 percentage point fall in inactive women.

6.

The rise in inactivity among working age men is concentrated on the unskilled
and those living in high unemployment regions. For example, 30 percent of
working age men with no qualifications were inactive in 1998 compared with
less than 5 percent in 1979. The majority of these are inactive because of
long-term sickness or disability.

7.

One of the lessons from these changes in inactivity is that the inadequate
education and training received in the past by a significant part of the
population has not only been disastrous for them personally but has meant that
the UK economy has been significantly poorer by not making using of their
potential. The benefits to the economy overall as more women have chosen to
work have been more or less cancelled out, at least in numerical terms, by the
steady withdrawal of men from the labour force.
