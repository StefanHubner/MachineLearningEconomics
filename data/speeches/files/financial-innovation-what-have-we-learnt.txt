Section 1: Introduction
1

At last year’s conference, we presented a paper highlighting the profound impact

of rapid financial innovation, deregulation and capital market integration on the
performance, risk and management of the global financial system. We particularly
noted the benefits of financial innovation.1 We argued that the development of new
financial instruments has created opportunities for households and corporates to
improve their management of financial risks and has facilitated the smoothing of
consumption and investment over time and across different states of the world. But
we also emphasised that the breakdown of barriers to the supply of financial products
and the large volume of risk pooling and shifting within and across borders has
increased the network interconnections within the global financial system. That has
added to the system’s complexity. And we underlined that understanding and
addressing the corresponding evolution of financial system risks poses major
challenges for financial institutions and for financial stability authorities.
2

The past year has seen these potential major challenges turn into real practical

problems. We are now almost a year into a credit crisis centred around a sudden
evaporation of market liquidity for many structured credit products that rapidly spilled
over into wholesale bank funding markets and beyond, given a complex web of
interconnections.2 So it is an opportune moment to review whether the financial
innovation of recent years that created such structured products has indeed been a
positive force, as argued by Alan Greenspan3, for example, or whether financial
innovation has been a malign development, producing “financial weapons of mass
destruction” in the words of Warren Buffett4?
3

There is clearly some force in both arguments. On balance, we continue to see

considerable benefits to households and corporates from the broadening of choice in
financial products and from improvements in the completeness of financial markets.

But equally, the severe pressures and strains of the past year have highlighted the
pervasiveness of some market frictions that have a major bearing on system-wide
behaviour and dynamics, amplifying and transmitting shocks. Action to lower these
frictions is consequently important to capture the full benefits of innovation and to
ensure that these are durable.
4

This paper explores these issues further. Section 2 provides a short reminder of

the staggering extent of financial innovation in recent decades. Section 3 sets out the
theoretical vision of how financial innovation offers the potential for substantial
improvements in the capability of corporates and households to manage financial
risks. Section 4 highlights the obstacles to fulfilment of that vision given the
imperfections in financial markets. Lessons for the future and possible policy
responses are discussed in Section 5, while Section 6 concludes.
Section 2: Trends in financial innovation

The pace of change in financial markets in recent years is truly remarkable. A few

statistics help to illustrate this point and set the scene:
•

The outstanding value of interest rate swaps and other derivatives reached
almost $600 trillion or some 11 times annual global GDP by the end of 2007,
according to the BIS. Ten years ago the value was around $75 trillion (2 ½
times GDP) (Chart 1). The global derivatives market expanded almost 50%
during 2007.

•

The credit default swap (CDS) component has experienced explosive growth.
The outstanding value of CDS contracts has surged to more than five times the
outstanding principal of global corporate bonds by the end of 2007. Yet only
three years’ ago, at end-2004, the CDS market was only some 85% of the size
of the corporate bond market. The CDS market is now by far the more liquid
market for trading credit risk.

•

The outstanding value of commodity derivatives outstanding has risen from
around $400 billion in 1998 to $9 trillion at the end of 2007.

•

Options markets have also grown very strongly. For example, the outstanding
principal of interest rate options has increased from $8 trillion to $57 trillion in
the past decade.

•

Innovation and the removal of barriers to cross-border activity has spurred
global capital market integration. For example, turnover in foreign exchange
markets has tripled since the BIS survey in 2001. And cross-border asset
holdings have outpaced the strong growth in the global stock of financial
assets.

•

Markets offering investors ready-made portfolios rose very rapidly in advance
of the credit crisis. Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) globally was
$1460 billion in the first half of 2007, up from $425 billion 9 years previously.
There was rapid expansion in the market for collateralised debt obligations

4

(CDO) from $75 billion in the first half of 2005 to $200 billion in the first half
of 2007. And innovation spawned greater complexity. Investment banks
launched a series of highly complex products such as constant proportion debt
obligations (CPDO) and re-securitisations of CDOs and ABSs (so called
CDO-squared and CDOs of ABS).
•

Demand for such tailor-made products has plummeted over the past year,
while other markets such as the corporate CDS market have continued to
expand rapidly. A possible explanation and assessment of the implications is
set out in the remainder of the paper.

Section 3: Financial innovation: a broadening of choice
6

A crucial function of the financial system is to help companies and households to

manage risks. The discharge of this function depends on the type of financial
products or contracts made available to companies and households to hedge and take
on risk exposures in close alignment with their individual risk preference and
tolerance, as well as the capability of the institutions that make up the financial system
to manage the risk inherent in these products. The focus of this section is on how
innovation in financial instruments extends the choice of risk management products
available to companies and households, moving us closer towards a vision of liquid
markets in state contingent securities. But it must also be borne in mind that
imperfections within financial markets will affect the performance of these innovative
financial products, that may in turn limit their availability. Such frictions may thus
impact on the ability of the financial system to support corporate and household risk
management. That is covered in section 4.
7

As an illustration of the potential benefits of innovation in contract design and

broadening choice, consider the market for corporate credit risk. In previous decades,
the only securities available to investors wishing to invest in corporate debt were
corporate bonds. One might call such assets “natural assets” as the same instrument
that is issued by the borrower is also that held by the investor. In this example, the
role of the financial system is simply to facilitate the intermediation between end
borrowers and end investors, and, in some cases, to provide a secondary market in the
asset, intermediating between alternate end investors. There is no transformation of
the asset.

5

8

Financial engineering can, however, decompose the returns on a corporate bond

into different fundamental components or “atoms” of risk:
•

For example, credit default swaps can be used to separate the return on a
corporate bond into the compensation for default risk and the compensation
earned on a risk-free security. An investor wanting to make an inter-temporal
transfer without taking on any credit risk, for example, could then buy a bond
and purchase credit default swap protection, thus retaining exposure to the
cash flows on the risk free component of the underlying instrument.
Synthetically, this expands the volume of low risk investment portfolios. On
the other side, a market is created for those who specifically want to trade
default risk which allows cleaner pricing of this dimension of risk. Efficient
markets for each element should raise the efficiency of the corporate bond
market as a whole, with attendant benefits for both borrowers and investors.

•

Furthermore, because credit default swaps have different maturities, investors
could, for example, buy the corporate bond and retain the resulting exposure to
default risk in the near term. But they could also buy protection against
default at longer horizons, about which they may be more uncertain.

•

Moreover, nominal corporate bonds can also be separated into a nominal and
inflation-linked risk component if the corporate also issues inflation-indexed
bonds. Investors can utilise these instruments to buy or sell protection against
exposure to inflation risk.

As noted above, the markets for single-name corporate credit default swaps have
become more liquid than the underlying bonds given the flexibility and specificity
they provide to end-investors.
9

The underlying components of risk can, of course, also be recombined by

financial engineering to create new financial products with different risk
characteristics. Extending the above example, single-name credit default swaps have
been pooled together into standardised indices. That creates a synthetic market in
generalised corporate credit risk, enabling investors wishing to hedge or establish a
new position linked to macro-economic risk to do so. And there are many parallels
such as products tracking equity indices or commodity prices or emerging market debt
to name but a few.

6

10 The value of standardised indices to financial intermediaries can be illustrated by
considering a credit default swap dealer, who may find at the end of a day’s trading
that they have been a net seller of default protection on several dozen corporates. The
dealer could hedge such a position by buying protection on the standardised indices.
The hedge would of course not be perfect as in all likelihood the firms in the
standardised indices would not be an exact match to those whom the dealer had sold
protection. But because indices are relatively liquid and thus cheaper to trade, the
dealer may decide that the resulting saving in transaction costs may outweigh the
residual ‘basis’ risk that results from the hedge being imperfect. And through
competition, the benefit would tend to be shared by corporate borrowers and investors
in corporate credit risk.
11 Taking the example further, investors who wish to take exposure to generalised
corporate credit risk but who wish to limit their potential losses can do so through
trading options contracts on the standardised indices. The array of options with
different “strike prices”, which represent the thresholds beyond which the options do
or do not pay out, allows market participants to express opinions about the
distribution of possible future aggregate corporate conditions.
12 Credit default swaps are not the only way an investor can engineer a targeted
exposure to credit risk. Alternatively, an investor can take a position on corporate
credit risk by purchasing a securitised product such as a collateralised debt obligation
(CDO). In this case, a pool of assets such as corporate bonds is created and the
payment streams produced by these are allocated to different classes or tranches
depending on the default experience. This allows investors to take positions on the
scale of default losses in the underlying asset pool.
13 Stepping back, the extended example above highlights how financial engineering
has facilitated the decomposition of corporate credit risk into different subcomponents
and the recombination of these subcomponents into new financial products with
different risk characteristics. There are many other examples across the financial
system. The consequent broadening of the range of financial products has improved
choice and the matching and tailoring of products to customer needs. For instance,
the ability of non-financial corporates to manage their risks has been transformed by
their increasing use of derivatives to hedge interest rates and currency risk as well as
their exposures to commodity prices. And notwithstanding the current squeeze on the
7

availability of credit (and withdrawal of many products), households have also
benefited from a significant expansion in the range of saving and borrowing products
compared to the position 20 years ago.
14 The practical examples described above clearly demonstrate the benefits of
financial innovation. Enhancing the capability to transform and transfer risk, and thus
improving the matching of the supply of risk products to the demands of end investors
offers the prospect of lower risk premia and greater financial efficiency. And that in
turn should lower the cost of capital for firms and improve the ability of households to
smooth their lifetime consumption and to insure against unexpected outcomes.
15 Taking an even further step back, there is a beguiling vision of financial
innovation taking us closer towards a world of more complete and efficient markets
for state-contingent contracts. The ability to decompose and trade the distribution of
many dimensions of fundamental risks creates a potential lattice of efficient risk
prices which can then, by arbitrage, be used to price efficiently the combinations of
these risks embedded in “natural assets” and in “synthetic assets” structured to meet
investor demand.
Section 4: Frictions and Market Imperfections
16 The previous section described how financial innovation has widened the range
and choice of financial products available to corporates and households to facilitate
improved risk management. But it also noted the potential importance of market
imperfections and frictions in the provision of such contracts. One year on from the
onset of the current credit crisis, what have we learned about the performance of the
financial system and such market imperfections?
17 Looking broadly, an important lesson from the past year, is that these frictions
appear more powerful than market participants and financial authorities previously
judged. They pose substantial barriers and practical limitations to the achievement of
a stylised vision of full, complete, and efficient markets in fundamental components
of risk. Five areas of potential weakness are highlighted in turn: incomplete
information; alignment of incentives; liquidity in financial markets; robustness of
market infrastructure; and system dynamics.

8

Incomplete information
18 The vision of a world of complete and efficient markets for risk depends on full
information. This full information requirement sounds deceptively simple but is
actually extremely onerous. An investor needs to know the mapping between states of
the world and the pay-offs they would receive in each state as well as the likelihood of
these states of the world materialising. This means not only understanding the details
of highly complex contracts but also the effects of the interplay between exposures
and contracts of all the other agents in the economy. So not surprisingly, many of the
problems that have occurred over the past 10 months have arisen out of incomplete
and asymmetric information. There are a number of dimensions.
19 First, it is very difficult to ascertain the pay-off distribution for many instruments.
For example, a mezzanine CDO tranche might have attachment and detachment
points of say 7% and 10%, meaning that for losses on the underlying collateral of less
than 7% they continue to pay out at par, but become worthless when losses reach
10%. The pay-offs to such instruments are therefore highly sensitive to quite minor
changes in expected credit conditions. In a full-information world with known
probability distributions, instruments with such highly sensitive pay-offs are no more
difficult to price than any others. But when lack of complete information makes the
future uncertain, in a Knightian sense, contracts with highly sensitive pay-offs to
slight changes in credit conditions become increasingly risky. Moreover, innovative
instruments inherently will not have a long run of performance data. Those seeking to
summarise their likely performance using statistical metrics based on limited data and
drawn from very benign circumstances have a very difficult task. Many investors in
RMBS and ABS CDOs linked to US sub prime mortgages have been surprised by the
extent to which the performance of these instruments has fallen short of even their
worst expectations. Securities with complex pay-offs, therefore, are highly vulnerable
to increased macroeconomic uncertainty.
20 Second, information loss is built into the securitisation process because of the
separation between the originator of the loan and the end investor. Chart 2 illustrates
how information is lost at every step in the chain of risk transfer. To some extent,
holding a diversified pool of underlying loans acts as protection against a lack of
information about idiosyncratic risk. But the experience of the past year has shown

9

that diversified pools and seniority in the tranche structure may not provide adequate
protection against highly co-ordinated or ‘systemic’ risk.

Chart 2 – Information Loss

Source: BIS Committee on the Global Financial System

21 Many investors had, of course, also delegated their monitoring responsibility to
credit rating agencies. This offered, potentially, a very significant efficiency gain.
Rather than many investors paying privately to be moderately informed – with
corresponding substantial replication of investment analysis - credit rating agencies
were paid to be well informed and to make this information public. But we now know
that rating agencies were also unable to overcome these same underlying information
problems and have been forced to make multiple down-grades to many of their ratings
of structured credit products and to modify the models they use for ratings. A major
problem for the market as a whole has been that once investors collectively lost trust
in rating agencies, the next most informed participants in the market were a long way
behind. As a result, there was a step-change down in the level of confidence in the

10

likely performance of these assets and a consequent system-wide increase in the risk
premia required to hold such assets. With hindsight, information generation and
processing was too reliant on a limited number of rating agencies, and there was too
much confidence in the ability of individual rating agencies to solve the highly
complex information problems underlying some securities.
22 Third, it is very hard to determine counterparty credit risk for state-contingent
securities. In a world of full information, the state-contingent survival of
counterparties would be known and nobody would accept contracts from those who
could not honour them – at least not without a substantial price discount by way of
compensation. But when investors cannot know the full network of exposures in the
financial system, it is extremely hard to estimate where the ultimate incidence of
losses from an extreme shock will occur. The failure of your counterparties’
counterparty can shift you up the queue of potential losers quite quickly. Moreover,
the fear of potential counterparty risk itself quickly affects the behaviour of individual
firms and thus leads to a collective lowering of risk appetite.
23 These problems are potentially the most acute for what might be called tail-risk
products. During the boom, tail-risk products, like deeply out of the money options,
seemed an easy way to make money. The protection seller could collect a steady
stream of premia with the extremely unlikely prospect of having to make a very large
payment. Since these sorts of contracts offer “deep” insurance, it is important to the
system as a whole that they are held by the most robust institutions. Here, the theory
of risk transfer was that risk would be re-allocated to those most able to bear it. In
practice, though, those most willing to take these risks have in some cases turned out
to be those who understood the risks the least and thus were prepared to take it on at
too low a price. This problem is extremely hard to guard against because of the
difficulty in determining whether a counterparty who is insuring you against risk (or a
chain of counterparties) fully understands what they have taken on and have the
capacity to make good on their commitment in adverse states of the world. In recent
months, banks have been forced to write down the value of contracts that they had
bought from monoline insurers to guarantee the payments promised by their holdings
of highly-rated CDOs linked to US sub prime mortgages. With the likelihood of such
guarantees being called upon appearing very small, the monolines wrote a large
volume of such guarantees. But more recently, this prospect has become a distinct

11

possibility, and one that threatens the viability of some of the monoline insurers, and
thus their perceived ability to pay.
Incentives
24 These information problems are difficult enough when risk is treated as
exogenous. And in a world of full information, ‘nature’ can be the only source of
uncertainty. But in practice when there is a lack of information and uncertainty about
actions, the incentives facing individual actors become very important and can lead to
endogenous risk creation within the financial system.
25 These incentive problems have been clearly apparent in risk transfer markets. As
has been widely described elsewhere, if loan originators do not have sufficient capital
at stake, they will not screen potential borrowers adequately. 5 In the US sub-prime
mortgage market, rewarding loan originators by volume of issuance was a recipe for
lax credit assessment standards. But even when originators seem to have an economic
stake in performance, for example by holding some of the ‘first loss’ or equity tranche
of a securitisation, this is not sufficient to guarantee incentive compatibility, as it is
possible to hedge the exposure to the equity tranche through a separate market
transaction.
26 There is, though, also a more subtle problem. As mentioned above, holding a
diversified pool provides protection against idiosyncratic risk. But the absence of a
concentrated exposure can also limit the incentive to monitor individual loans, and
thus the pooling of risk may lead to a reduction in the overall level of risk screening
ex ante and monitoring ex post. It was the combination of these misaligned incentives
that proved such a problem in the US sub-prime mortgage market. Individual endinvestors had little incentive to monitor the performance of loan originators, perhaps
presuming that originators had sufficient stake in the securitisation to provide market
discipline. Issuers, though, transferred much of the risk and did so comprehensively,
as they needed to demonstrate that they had transferred risk irrevocably before they
could get capital relief. But in the absence of adequate monitoring, originators could
chase volume at the expense of lending standards.

5

See for example, the Bank of England Financial Stability Report, October 2007.

12

27 Therefore, two elements at the heart of the benefits of financial innovation – the
ability to pool and transfer risk – contributed to an endogenous increase in the level of
underlying credit risk.
28 There is also a potential incentive problem arising from the separation of legal
ownership from economic exposure – although this is at the moment a possible
difficulty for the future. Credit default swaps transfer the risk of economic loss to the
seller of protection but the right to trigger covenants or put a firm into administration
remains with the underlying asset holder. A protected asset holder, therefore, has little
incentive to monitor a company closely and trigger covenants or force it into
administration at the first signs that its business may have become unsustainable. And
the seller of protection lacks an alternative legal remedy. Companies may therefore
continue to operate for longer than they did in the past once they get into trouble. So,
the use of credit default swaps may reduce the probability of default but increase loss
given eventual default.
Liquidity
29 These problems of incomplete information, and misaligned incentives have had a
major impact on the market liquidity of innovative financial instruments.
30 As described above, misaligned incentives in origination and distribution allowed
the provision of sub-prime mortgages to households with very little prospect of
repayment and significant vulnerability to modest changes in economic
circumstances. So any investor trying to estimate the distribution of likely future
delinquency rates amongst sub-prime borrowers would not only have to consider the
range of macroeconomic outcomes but also how much this effect would be amplified
by poor credit risk screening. This would be an extremely difficult variable to
quantify. But because of the sensitivity of complex securities to small changes in loss
rates, differing judgements about the quality of risk screening could make a material
difference to the value of the instrument. The recognition that risk screening and the
availability and quality of information on the performance of complex products was
significantly weaker than previously anticipated, as for example investors lost
confidence in the quality of credit ratings, led to a substantial increase in the risk
premium required to hold such assets. These effects made the valuation of assets

13

extremely uncertain and contributed to the rapid evaporation of secondary market
liquidity.
31 There is also an important and fundamental tension between the capability of
financial engineering to tailor financial products to meet individual investor demand
more effectively and secondary market liquidity. The more closely a specific
financial instrument is matched to the risk preferences of an individual investor, the
harder it is to find another investor willing to trade that exact instrument in the event
of a shock to those risk preferences.
32 In other words, the improved matching of risk to an individual’s risk profile has
given rise to an increase in basis risk within the system. As one illustrative example,
any investor wishing to hedge any exposure to the US sub-prime mortgage market
over the past year or so would have little alternative but to trade in the standardised
ABX indices (which themselves have often been relatively illiquid) rather than in the
specific instrument they held. The developments over the past year have illustrated
that hedges have often provided less effective than envisaged, and that there was a
significant under-pricing of the inherent basis risk of many innovative structured
instruments at the point of origination, given the lack of secondary market liquidity
for such specific risk. Looking forward, it is quite likely that there will be greater
unbundling of complex instruments into standardised components that are likely to be
liquid and readily traded with low transactions costs, and bespoke elements that will
command a higher risk premium given their inherent illiquidity.
Strengthening financial infrastructure
33 Because of the specificity of the risk, innovative financial products are rarely
exchange traded. Non-standardised products require the services of a broker-dealer to
trade. But over the counter (OTC) trading is vulnerable to many operational risks. In
particular, investors are exposed to the default of the major broker-dealer
counterparties. This was a significant concern to counterparties of Bear Stearns when
it was in distress before being taken over by JP Morgan. To moderate such concerns
in the future, private sector initiatives are being developed to introduce a central
clearer to the CDS market. Such initiatives are very welcome. Although the net
positions of CDS dealers generally represent only a very small fraction of their gross
positions, because these gross positions have grown so rapidly in recent years, inter-

14

dealer positions can sometimes be very significant – even after netting. A central
clearer that would offset any long bilateral positions that one bank had with another
with any short positions that the same bank had with a third bank, could significantly
reduce the counterparty risk in the CDS market. A leading proposal at present is
centred on the Clearing Corporation, which is jointly owned by eleven major banks
and other trading platforms.
34 Counterparty risk, as described above, is particularly corrosive for liquidity in
financial markets. Investors become concerned not only with the soundness of their
immediate counterparties but their counterparties’ counterparties, and so on. When
risk crystallises it can be unclear which financial institutions have been adversely
affected. As a result of limited disclosure and transparency, investors may limit the
supply of funds to a much broader array of counterparties than necessary. This helps
to explain why all banks found it more difficult to raise funding when the
deterioration in the performance of sub prime assets became apparent, even though it
would later be revealed that some banks were more exposed than others.
35 A further challenge is that the markets for innovative financial instruments can
grow very rapidly, outstripping the capacity of back offices to keep up with trading.
Towards the end of 2005, CDS trading had run ahead of the processing of trades to
the extent that the major CDS dealers on average had unconfirmed trades outstanding
that were equivalent to a couple of weeks of trading volume. If the reference entities
underlying these CDS trades had defaulted, it would not have been clear – at least for
some time – who was owed money by whom. The international authorities then set
the major CDS dealers targets to reduce volumes of unconfirmed trades, which
subsequently fell significantly. But a backlog of unconfirmed trades did start to
cumulate again during the early months of the recent financial turmoil, although this
has also diminished over the past six months. Furthermore, the proportion of new
CDS trades that are confirmed electronically and hence immediately has increased
sharply from around 50% when concerns were raised in 2005 to over 90% at present.
36 It is also important that innovative financial products are documented sufficiently
carefully and that their risks are accurately communicated to potential investors. The
more complex the instrument, the greater the scope for misunderstanding. Investors
have recently incurred significant losses on complex securities like CDOs and a
number are expected to sue for mis-selling. HSH Nordbank is already suing UBS for
15

the mis-selling of CDOs, for example, and Banca Popolare di Intra has a lawsuit
against Bank of America for the same reason. Wingecarribee Shire Council is also
suing Lehman Brothers for the mis-selling of CDOs.
System dynamics and the amplification of shocks
37 The frictions of incomplete information, imperfect incentives and inherent
illiquidity of bespoke financial instruments may also be amplified by adverse
dynamics within the financial system itself. For example, poorly-designed
remuneration structures and short-term performance targets may encourage ‘herding’
behaviour within the financial system that raises the costs of taking a contrarian view.
And there are also well-documented concerns that regulatory design pays insufficient
attention to the risk of procyclicality6.
38 It also appears to be the case that many firms failed to take sufficient account of
the likely behaviour of other firms, and thus of system properties, when designing
stress tests and contingency plans. They were far too confident in their ability to exit
or hedge positions in high risk instruments, where trades were highly crowded, and
were consequently under-prepared for the evaporation of market liquidity.
39 Moreover, there are some financial instruments (such as mortgage-backed
securities where the mortgages have prepayment options), where the dynamic hedging
behaviour of holders can amplify the price movement, as dynamic hedging can lead to
additional short hedging positions being required after a price fall. With individual
institutions being small relative to the market, each individual institution may think
that their new short position will have little or no impact on market prices. But
collectively, the aggregate demand for new short positions is likely to drag prices
further down and amplify the original shock, generating additional losses for those
who were slower to update their dynamic hedging7.

Section 5: Some lessons and policy responses
40 We are now around a year into a severe credit crisis centred on many of the
complex structured instruments described earlier. An immediate behavioural response
of risk managers in major financial institutions has been to pull out of these markets
entirely. This has dramatically reduced primary and secondary market liquidity and
increased price volatility, further reducing incentives to invest in these instruments.
The short term outlook for many of these innovative instruments is poor. And as
described in section 4, the past year has revealed that market imperfections and
frictions are more potent than was previously thought. It is clear that there are
important limitations on the capacity of the financial system to deliver all of the
benefits of financial innovation spelled out in section 3. But equally it would be
wrong to jump to the opposite extreme, given there are clearly major welfare gains
from improved choice of financial products and better matching of risks.
41 So what are some of the lessons for financial innovation? What will the landscape
look like in 5-10 years’ time, once the dust has settled and institutional changes can be
implemented to address the frictions identified? What if anything can policy do to
facilitate or expedite this process of adjustment?
42 A first observation is that it is important to distinguish between different financial
products. As shown in Table 1, there has been a huge dispersion in activity in
different innovative products over the past year. For example, the corporate CDS
market grew by 36% in the second half of 2007 and appears to be underpinned by
strong demand. Other derivative and option markets have also continued to grow
very rapidly. But on the other hand, new issues of corporate CDOs, CLOs and ABS
CDOs have virtually completely stopped. Complex structured products with a high
premium on information requirements and with a high bespoke element have thus
fared much worse than simpler innovative instruments where there is more natural
two-way trading and liquidity. Moreover, it is important not to lose sight that the
success of some products and failure of others is a standard feature of the innovation
process and of a competitive economy.

43 It is vital that market forces should be decisive in determining which instruments
live or die. Regulators and supervisors should try to make the playing field as level as
possible and certainly be on the look out for regulatory distortions which unduly
favour the creation of particular products or limit the creation of other welfareimproving innovative instruments. But the market place should decide which products
match issuer and investor desires once all risks are correctly priced.
44 Looking into a crystal ball what are some of our expectations for future financial
market developments? We will put forward 7 suggestions:
•

First, there will be additional focus on simpler, more standardised products.
For example, it would be a surprise and probably undesirable if mezzanine
resecuritisations were to reappear. Simpler products should be easier to
understand and therefore less prone to radical changes in expectations of their
likely performance. Improved stability of expectations should help sustain
market liquidity during periods of stress. Standardised products also
economise on information requirements and therefore also improve liquidity in
secondary markets.

•

Second, products will be more transparent in design and content, to improve
the ease of monitoring and hence lower information costs. Increased
transparency should not be confused with reams of data. The issuance
documentation for many securitisations often contained a barrage of statistics.
For CDOs of ABS, these documents could run to thousands of pages given
that the documentation for each underlying ABS could already comprise of
hundreds of pages. Any investor with the appetite to conduct due diligence
would have found this volume of information completely indigestible.
Products are likely to come with a broader range of standard expected
performance statistics.

•

Third, as already recommended by the Financial Stability Forum and the
CGFS8, rating agencies will supply additional information on the risk
characteristics of rated securities and the sensitivity and uncertainty attached
to their ratings. But there will also be increased recognition of the limitations
and costs of any monitoring function for highly complex products. That, too,
will support greater standardisation and transparency.

•

Fourth, and relatedly, end-investors will demand more explicit rules governing
acceptable collateral for securitisation and greater due diligence and risk
sharing by originators and issuers. For example, strict definitions of
prime/Alt-A/sub-prime mortgages will be required based on FICO scores,
loan-to-value ratios and other characteristics. And originators will be required
to report their exposure to the securities they issue. Contracts, for example,
may require issuers to declare and maintain a significant stake in
securitisations to align their incentives to screen and monitor loans.

•

Fifth, investment banks will continue to offer tailored products to match
specific risks. But there will be much greater recognition of the illiquidity and
hence cost of the bespoke component. Equilibrium liquidity premia will be
higher. That is likely to lower demand for such products, perhaps
substantially.

Sixth, banks and other financial institutions will provide more information on
exposures as pressures to improve market disclosure and transparency
continue. And already regulators are assembling best practice accounting
disclosures which should become standard reporting.

•

Seventh, greater emphasis on standardisation of products may facilitate
improvements in market infrastructure. Pressure will continue for more
products to be traded on exchanges rather than OTC. That should also help
control counterparty and other operational risks.

Section 6: Conclusion
45 Financial engineering facilitates the transformation and reshaping of risk. It thus
supports the development of new products that decompose, transfer and pool risks to
match user needs. Innovation thus delivers a broadening of financial choice that
enables companies and households to improve their management of risk, with
attendant gains in economic welfare.
46 There are, however, a number of frictions and market imperfections that lower the
effectiveness of financial innovation. There may be insufficient information to gauge
the risk in new financial instruments. And indeed information can get lost when a
chain of parties are involved in the creation of new financial instruments. If these
parties do not retain an economic interest in the performance of the instrument, its
inherent risk can grow as incentives to screen and monitor weaken. In addition, the
benefits of tailoring the risk profile to meet the demands of specific investors can be
offset by the poor liquidity that might apply to a bespoke component. These frictions
have become much more apparent during the credit crisis of the past year, during
which time primary market issuance and secondary market trading of some innovative
financial instruments has fallen sharply.
47 Looking ahead, however, ideas are being developed to lower some of the frictions
from which innovative structured credit instruments in particular have suffered during
recent months. Removal of these frictions will, in some cases, necessitate recognition
of additional costs, for example in the screening of information and in the provision
and cost of liquidity, that were severely underplayed in the earlier boom in financial
markets. Recognition of these costs will, however, strengthen the resilience of the

20

financial system and underpin the durability of the manifold benefits from financial
innovation.
