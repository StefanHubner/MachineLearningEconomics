1. Introduction
For the first time in some years the news on the outlook for economic activity in the UK over the past month
or so has been overwhelmingly positive. Business surveys – of both current and future activity – look
stronger and consistent with growth at least as high as what we used to think of as normal. Consumer
confidence has moved up sharply. Hardly any indicator has failed to improve. This is all encouraging and
very welcome. It is likely that the rate of the growth of the economy right now is at – and quite possibly
1

above – the average rate in the 50 years up to the onset of the financial crisis that started in 2007. But this
comes after a period of several years of virtually no growth; and those recent low growth years came after a
disastrous period in 2009 when output plummeted. So it would be spectacularly misguided to think that
some signs of more normal growth mean that the economy is back to normal; and it would be equally
misguided to think that if growth were to be near trend monetary policy should be quickly returned to a more
normal setting. There are two reasons for that – first, the recent encouraging signs of growth might not prove
to be durable (though I think they will); second – and more significant – the economy has been operating far
short of its potential and the amount of slack is almost certainly large enough to mean that a sustained period
of above average growth is needed to remove it (Chart 1). I believe that the main reason why it is now useful
to offer guidance on the future stance of UK monetary policy is to reduce the risk that people believe that
monetary policy would be quickly tightened once output began to rise at more normal rates. The nature of
the guidance is simple; the message from the MPC is this: So long as inflation pressures don't start heading
in the wrong direction, we will not tighten monetary policy until a recovery is strong enough and sustained
enough that it has made a meaningful dent in unemployment so that it at least falls to 7 per cent.

A key point here is that focusing just on the rate of growth of output is not a good guide to whether economic
activity is running at a pace consistent with the control of inflation. Growth has to be seen in the context of
the level of activity from which that growth comes. If that level of activity is significantly below a rate
consistent with controlled inflation – as I believe is the case in the UK today – then it does not make sense to
quickly return monetary policy to a more normal setting once growth moves to more normal rates. One
indication that the level of activity is well below what can be sustainable, and consistent with inflation at the
target, is that unemployment is far higher than during the long period before the financial train wreck and
when inflation stayed close to target. Wage settlements have also been unusually low running beneath the
actual (and expected) rates of consumer price inflation for some years. That suggests two things: first that
slack it the economy is significant and second that linking the horizon over which an exceptionally
expansionary monetary policy continues to support demand to the rate of unemployment has merit.

Recessions are defined as at least two consecutive quarters of falling output.
Covers the G20 advanced economies over the period from 1960 to 2006. For some countries, data are not available back to
1960; for those countries, the sample starts at the earliest available date.
Big five banking crises are Spain (1977), Norway (1987) Finland (1991), Sweden (1991) and Japan (1992), as defined in
Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).
Zero denotes the pre-recession peak in GDP, or the peak in GDP during the year of the banking crisis, as defined in footnote
(c). For the UK quarter zero is 2008 Q1; the final quarter for the UK is 2013 Q2.

Today I want to talk about forward guidance and what I see are its uses. But I want to talk at greater length
about the sustainability of a period of more rapid growth and what it might mean for inflation pressures and
optimal monetary policy. In doing that I will offer some thoughts on economic modelling and what I see as a
deficiency in some of the most commonly used models of the whole economy.

2. Forward guidance

Let me start with some observations about the guidance the MPC has recently given. As you will know the
essence of it is this: that so long as inflation pressures remain consistent with inflation moving back to the
target monetary policy will not be tightened until a recovery has been sustained long enough to take the
economy much closer to its potential level of production such that unemployment is significantly lower.

2

To my mind the single most useful thing about giving this guidance is that it makes clear that so long as
inflation pressures remain controlled then a return to a more normal monetary policy is conditional on a
sustained recovery in demand which brings down the rate of unemployment. Growth at average rates, or
slightly above them, for a couple of quarters is most unlikely to bring slack in the economy or the level of
unemployment down significantly. So the guidance implies that a – very welcome – couple of quarters of
normal (or a bit above normal) growth should not mean that policy is about to be tightened. The reason I
think guidance is helpful now is that it reduces the risk that a recovery that is still somewhat embryonic is not
smothered by the anticipation that a tightening in monetary policy is imminent.

Since guidance was announced market interest rates in the UK have moved up – both at the short end of the
yield curve and at longer maturities. I suspect this is largely because the weight of money is behind a view
that the significant positive news on the economic outlook means that the 7% unemployment level might be
reached within around eighteen months. This is rather sooner than I think is likely. It is plausible that the
level of productivity – which has fallen enormously relative to the trend we have been on – will bounce back
once growth becomes more sustained (See chart 2). If that is so unemployment is likely to fall rather more
slowly than would be usual. None of this is certain. We shall see how things play out. Maybe the market
moves will prove transient – maybe not. I should certainly be pleased if we saw unemployment fall fast and
productivity move sharply back towards its trend path because that would mean growth was very strong
while inflation pressures might be contained since unit labour costs would be held down by rising output per
hour worked.

(b) The continuation of the pre-2008/09 recession average rate is calculated by projecting forward labour productivity from
2008 Q2 using the average quarterly growth rate between 1999 Q3 and 2008 Q1.

For whatever their reason, the financial market movements in the month or so since guidance was given at
the start of August – a period when the news on economic activity and demand in the UK has been
consistently positive – have been quite significant. The 1 year OIS rate two year forward is up by around
60 basis points (Chart 3); the sterling effective exchange rate is up by around 4.5% (Chart 4); 2-3 year swap
rates (off which most fixed rate mortgages are priced) are up by between 16bp and 33bp (Chart 5).

These movements may not persist, but that is far from clear. Either way, I find it hard to see them as a sign
that forward guidance has somehow failed at the outset. Yet some have suggested that forward guidance
has backfired because the economy has picked up which means that the slow process of normalisation of
monetary policy might have to begin before the middle of 2016, which was the date at which the MPC
3

thought it was likely that unemployment might have fallen to 7%.

3

This is speaking rather loosely. To be exact, the MPC judged at the time of its August Inflation report that the
unemployment rate is as likely to reach the 7% threshold before the forecast horizon in mid-2016 as after it. In other words, mid-2016
was the median estimate of the date at which the unemployment threshold would be reached.

I think there is a rather Alice in Wonderland, upside down logic to this. It implies that somehow the MPC find
unwelcome signs of a recovery in the economy. I can assure you that we do not! I would be pleased if
growth turned out to be strong, productivity improved and inflation moved back towards the target level over
the next eighteen months. And if all that happened so that unemployment came down steadily and
significantly then I should also be pleased to start the process of normalising monetary policy. No one
should want Bank Rate to be virtually zero for any longer than is needed. But it is quite possible to get
average growth in the economy for 6 or 8 quarters – and maybe above average growth – and yet
unemployment does not fall much because productivity growth is rapid. Not only is this possible, I think it is
plausible. Chart 6 below shows just how strongly correlated are the growth in GDP and productivity. It is
natural for productivity – a highly cyclical variable – to grow fast once demand picks up after a period of very
anaemic growth.

If this happened in a way that meant unemployment only fell very modestly it would also

suggest that spare capacity might remain substantial and that a very expansionary monetary policy remained
appropriate.

I don’t want to put much emphasis on some of the more bizarre interpretations as to what counts as success
or failure of guidance. I think most businesses and households get the basic message – that so long as
inflation pressures appear relatively well contained and consistent with a return to target then it is only when
there has been a sustained recovery that has eaten significantly into slack that policy will be tightened. And
in fact although I think the, relatively modest, tightening in effective monetary conditions since early August –
the rise in bond yields, the appreciation of sterling; the increase in money market rates – is not in itself
helpful, it is what I would call a benign tightening. By a benign tightening I mean that it is a response to
stronger news on economic activity and confidence – and not a malign tightening, when a rise in money
market interest rates and in bond yields comes as people expect higher inflation down the road.

So while the tightening in monetary conditions is not a very helpful consequence of the news we have had
over the past couple of months the fact is that that economic news has been good. The surveys and the

data on activity have been rather stronger than we might have expected at our August meeting (when we
had already factored in some fairly favourable data relative to July). I would guess that right now we might
have a rate of growth in the economy of between 2.5 and 3.5%. I think that is unambiguously good. The key
questions are whether it can carry on, and if it does, what does it mean for the trajectory of inflation and the
appropriate monetary policy.

3. The sustainability of a recovery and monetary policy

I think there are good reasons to believe that for an economy that has been in a deep recession there can be
multiple equilibrium paths forward. By which I mean that for a given stance of policy there can be different
paths for output. On some of them people are more optimistic in a way that is self-confirming. On others,
low confidence about activity also becomes self-confirming. I think it is pretty clear that the higher growth,
more-optimistic path is better, and indeed much of the academic literature on multiple equilibria in the
aggregate economy shows that some paths are unambiguously better than others (they are Pareto superior).

This idea that there are multiple paths for the aggregate economy each of which could be an equilibrium has
4

a long tradition in economics. It is probably the central message of Keynesian economics. Keynes argued
that expectations over future returns are volatile and crucial in shaping investment and consumption plans.

5

Swings in households’ and firms’ expectations can move the economy from a good to a bad equilibrium, and
vice versa.
But Keynes’ central message – that there can be multiple equilibria – has been lost in the standard models
most economists have used over the past 10 to 15 years. These are models that get labelled New
Keynesian, but in which assumptions are usually made to ensure that the model has a unique equilibrium for
output and employment. Such models also have the property that the real economy tends to be
self-correcting – shocks will take the level of output, investment and employment away from its steady path
for a while but there are strong forces which attract them back towards the path they were on in the absence
of shocks.
I have much sympathy with the idea that the central message from Keynes – that there can be multiple
equilibria – has been lost in the standard models most economists, and central banks, have used in recent
6

years. Roger Farmer and Lawrence Summers – amongst others – have made this point and some of the
ideas in Robert Hall’s recent Jackson Hole paper chime with it.

For much of the time a view of the world that sees it as having strong self-correcting characteristics that
generates a path for output which fluctuates around a fairly smooth expansion path may be a reasonable
approximation. But when shocks are really big the forces drawing real output and employment back towards
the path they had been on – a path that in some sense remains a feasible one despite the shock – can be
very weak. So weak in fact that the economy may get stuck on a different trajectory for activity for so long
that for practical purposes it might as well be considered as a new equilibrium path that does not converge
back to the old one. One might – somewhat loosely – think of this view of the world as one with multiple
equilibria.
8

Let me sketch one version of the multiple equilibria story which seems relevant to the UK economy and to
the sustainability of a path forwards from here along which there is much higher growth. It seems sensible to
start by considering where we start from.

The financial crisis hit the UK economy hard. In 2008 and 2009 a dramatic rise in uncertainty and a rational
fear that future incomes might be much lower sharply reduced the value of assets. That reinforced the
pessimistic assessment of people’s own finances and of the general economic situation taking their
expectations to new lows (Chart 7). Unsurprisingly, consumption spending declined sharply (Chart 8).

This is very much a sketch – and is not a formal model. But there are formal models consistent with this sketch. For formal models of
the link between multiple equilbria and policy see, eg, Cooper (2002), ‘Financial Collapse: Lessons from the Great Depression’, Journal
of Economic Theory 107, pages 159-190, and Morris, Stephen and Shin, Hyun Song (2000), ‘Rethinking Multiple Equilibria in

Investment fell even more sharply than consumption. The decline in real interest rates on safe assets was
not reflected in a fall in the cost of finance to companies so there was no offset to the joint effects of lower
demand and falling confidence (Chart 9).

Aggregate measures of business expectations from the BCC, CBI and Markit/CIPS surveys have been produced by weighting
together sectoral surveys using nominal shares in value added. The surveys used are: BCC turnover confidence
(non-services and services), CBI business optimism (manufacturing, financial services, business/consumer services and
distributive trades) and Markit/CIPS orders (manufacturing) and business expectations (services). The BCC data are
non-seasonally adjusted. The aggregate measures have been adjusted to have the same mean and variance as quarterly
GDP growth over the period 1999–2013 Q2. Survey indicators have been moved forward one quarter.
Chained-volume measure. Business investment data have been adjusted by Bank staff to take account of the transfer of
nuclear reactors from the public corporation sector to central government in 2005 Q2. Data are to 2013 Q1.

Employment declined, but by less than anticipated, in part because employers were mindful of the costs of
rebuilding a workforce later and workers accepted pay freezes to preserve their jobs (Chart 10).

With activity falling faster than employment, labour productivity declined. Real wages fell, in line with weak
productivity (Chart 11). But unit labour costs rose, pushing up inflation (Chart 12).

Starting from such a situation and after a series of such large negative shocks one can envisage how an
economy might evolve along two very different paths. One is a ‘low confidence, weak growth’ path.
Investment would remain weak, labour productivity would not pick up, and real wages would stagnate to
match poor productivity. Because of weak productivity, unit labour cost growth might continue to be positive,
so cost and inflation pressures would not look unusually weak even though the economy is in a deep
recession. Falling real wages would not bring forth a return to full employment because demand for labour
would not rise enough in an environment where firms expect demand for their goods to continue to be weak.
I think this is roughly the path the UK has been on for much of the period since the financial train wreck.
But an alternative, self-fulfilling upswing may also be possible. On this path productivity growth is faster, real
wages can rise, and rising real incomes can justify greater spending. In this case greater optimism is
self-confirming and greater activity generates a sustainable upswing during which productivity is stronger and
higher incomes make the expectation of higher demand consistent with household plans.

Inflation pressures generated within the economy may be quite similar along both paths, but for different
reasons. In the first, inflation pressures do not fall much because unit labour cost growth is not unusually
low; in the second, inflation pressures do not rise since stronger growth itself helps hold down unit costs of
production because endogenous productivity growth creates flat costs of production.

This story – where different paths of output and slack generate rather similar paths for costs and inflation –
would mean that the link between spare capacity and inflation would be quite weak. In other words, the
Phillips curve would be quite flat. The evidence from a range of countries in recent years is consistent with
that. A recent IMF study found that inflation increases almost one for one with longer-term inflation
expectations but that a 1pp increase in cyclical unemployment would only lead to a 0.1pp reduction in
contemporaneous inflation. Chart 13 shows the distribution of their time-varying estimates of the slope of the
Phillips curve for 21 advanced economies. The slopes seem to have fallen to exceptionally low levels.

Country sample includes Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.

But there is considerable uncertainty around the slope of the Phillips curve. Empirical estimates appear to
depend on the precise specification of the equation, the estimation procedure, and the sample period.

10

Multiplicity of equilibria may be one reason behind these difficulties in pinning down the form of the Phillips
curve.

In theory there is a very big difference between being in a world in which there are multiple equilibria or in
one where the pull back towards a unique equilibrium level of real activity is very weak. But the practical
difference may actually be rather small over a horizon of several years rather than several decades. That is
important because the relevant horizon for monetary policy decisions is more likely to be several years than
several decades.

4. Policy implications

What implications does the possibility of multiple equilibria have for monetary policy in the UK? Initially, the
main distinction between the paths that I sketched above appears to be one of confidence: in the first,
households and firms are pessimistic about their future earnings, whereas they are optimistic in the second.
In both cases, beliefs are self-confirming.

I believe that monetary policy can help to kick the economy onto the better output path. In part this could be
done by changing people’s expectations about the future. Another possibility is to improve the fundamental
conditions under which the economy operates. Lowering interest rates would encourage consumption and

investment spending to be brought forward. Those effects can work even if the economy has a unique long
run equilibrium because it can accelerate the transition back to it. Whether or not there are multiple equilibria,
expectations and confidence can become more positive with a more expansionary monetary policy.
The recent rise in activity and confidence in the UK could be – I believe – sustainable and self-confirming.
Until quite recently it seemed to me that we remained on a path much more likely to be a low-confidence,
weak –activity equilibrium. I favoured a more expansionary monetary policy to help shift the economy onto a
better trajectory. There are some signs that we may now be on such a trajectory – and that is the reason I
think keeping Bank Rate and the stock of asset purchases at their current levels is the right policy for now.

I expect stronger growth to be consistent with inflation getting back to target through the course of next year
because any impact faster growth might have on some input costs to firms will be offset by stronger – and
cost reducing – growth in productivity. What the self-confirming and stronger path for output and confidence
does not need right now is tighter monetary policy. That is why I think the guidance that has been given on
monetary policy is helpful. It says that we will not raise interest rates until unemployment falls to 7%,
provided inflation is under control and there are no risks to financial stability.

5. Current policy
Let me come back to the current position in the UK and the policy issues. I would like to make 4 simple –
indeed obvious – points:
1. Signs of stronger activity and confidence are very welcome – there is absolutely no double edge
aspect to this that somehow comes from a tension with our forward guidance.

2. Whether stronger activity means we get to a 7% unemployment rate much faster depends on the
evolution of labour supply, and on how productivity responds to stronger demand. For any given
path of output the change in unemployment is very sensitive to any change in productivity. If
productivity responds positively there may be only a shallow fall in unemployment, despite stronger
output growth. The table below illustrates this sensitivity.

3. The 7% unemployment figure should be seen as a sign post, and not a preferred measure of slack; it
is not a level of unemployment such that once you move below it slack is gone. One very powerful
reason for stressing this is that I believe the unemployment numbers mean something rather
different to what has been typical in recent decades. This is because so many people are now on
part time work and an unusually high proportion of them want to work more. David Bell and David
Blanchflower investigated the implications in a recent paper.

situation in which someone is either unemployed, or is employed but would like to increase hours
worked at the going wage rate. (They subtract the hours those in employment would like to work
less from their underemployment measure.) Bell and Blanchflower note that unlike unemployment,
their measure of underemployment has continued to rise during most of the recession. Chart 14
illustrates this. Before the recession, those wishing to reduce their hours were balanced by those
wishing to increase their hours, so the underemployment rate tracked the unemployment rate
closely. But since the financial crisis, on a net basis, those working would have liked to work more
hours. So the underemployment rate exceeded the unemployment rate. This means that there is
likely to be more slack in the labour market than the unemployment rate suggests.

(a) Unemployment rate is a percentage of the economically active 16+ population. GDP is chained-volume measure at market
prices. Productivity is whole economy output per hour. This highly stylised table gives a mapping between changes in
output and changes in the unemployment rate, highlighting the sensitivity of that mapping to the response of productivity per
hour. These numbers are only illustrative and are based on a number of simplifying assumptions about the elasticity of labour
demand with respect to output, the extent to which increases in labour demand are met by increases in average hours worked
rather than in the number of employees, and the participation rate.

4. The absence of rising inflation pressures alongside the better news on activity gives a compelling
case for not normalising policy until recovery has been sustained and a meaningful reduction in
unemployment has been achieved.

6. Conclusion
I think there are good reasons to believe that for an economy that has been in a deep recession there are
likely to be multiple equilibrium paths forward. On some of them people are more optimistic in a way that is
self-confirming. On others, low confidence about activity also becomes self-confirming. It seems plausible
that you can have quite different paths for activity with very similar paths for inflation – on the low activity
paths unit labour costs may be very similar to the high activity paths. Low growth in nominal wages can be
offset by low growth in productivity on the low growth path, while higher wages are offset by higher
productivity growth on the high growth path. This is a powerful reason why an inflation targeting central bank
should do all it can to get the economy onto the higher growth path. I view the main way in which forward
guidance can help in the UK now is to raise the chances of staying on that more favourable path. I believe
we may be able to achieve that with the current setting for policy. That is a more optimistic position than I
took a few months ago when I believed that resuming asset purchases was warranted. The recent rise in
activity and confidence has the potential – I believe – to be sustainable and self-confirming. This is not
guaranteed. But I am now more confident that we are on path to recovery than at any time since I joined the
MPC in the first part of 2009. What a potentially self-confirming and stronger path for output and confidence
does not need right now is tighter monetary policy. That is what the guidance that has been given by the
MPC is designed to avoid.
Of course we could well have a slide in activity and in confidence for other reasons – there is no shortage of
things that could make that happen. But if that is how things play out we can and should do something about
it.
