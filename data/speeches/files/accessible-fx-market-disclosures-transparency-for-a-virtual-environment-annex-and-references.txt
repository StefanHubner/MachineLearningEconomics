Figure 1: Summary of Key Issues in the Disclosure and Transparency Landscape

-

Some disclosures have room for enhancement in light of the guidance
set out in the Code and other published GFXC materials. In particular,
there is heightened focus on a small set of key topics – e.g. last look,
pre-hedging, and agent vs principal – which have been identified as
requiring the most attention.

-

Whilst there can be a role for compliance and Legal areas in holding
the pen on disclosure documents, often being an effective conduit
between different market areas, market participants can overly rely on
Legal and compliance for producing disclosures with a lack of input
from relevant business areas. This can, at times, lead to unhelpful use
of legalese and a lack of “Plain English”.

-

Reject codes have developed as a way for Market Participants to
inform their Clients on how orders have been handled and transacted.
Reject codes can vary in detail and type from Market Participant to
Market Participant, creating issues for Clients in comparing order
handling across price makers. Increased guidance on the format
and/or nature of reject codes have therefore been identified as an
initiative that could improve clarity for Clients.

-

Disclosures are not provided to Market Participants in a consistent
manner and there is no repository/library of firms’ disclosures made
readily available to all Market Participants.

-

Disclosures are inconsistent in their structure, making it difficult to
identify within disclosure documents which Principles of the Code are
being referred to, and for Market Participants to compare across
different firms’ disclosures.

-

It is not clear what role platforms and prime brokerage providers can
play in facilitating disclosures on anonymous trading venues.

-

Linked to accessibility there is no central repository outlining when
disclosures have been reviewed or updated. This makes it challenging
for Market Participants to keep an up to date record of disclosures
from counterparties.
