The changing nature of risks
1 Spurred by rapid innovation, we are currently witnessing a period of major
structural change in financial intermediation and the global financial system.
Financial market activity is growing at a tremendous pace. For example, over the past
five years, the credit derivatives market has grown spectacularly from around
$1 trillion notional amount outstanding in 2001 to around $20 trillion in 2006
(Chart 1) and the issuance of leveraged loans has increased almost three-fold (Chart
2). The balance sheets of the major global financial institutions (the so-called large
complex financial institutions or LCFIs) have more than doubled since 2000, fuelled
by an increase in trading assets (Chart 3). Turnover in the UK and US foreign
exchange markets has risen by around 50% in only the last couple of years. And
capital market integration is rising rapidly as barriers to cross border flows have come
down. Taking a longer sweep, over the past 35 years cross border asset holdings
having risen more than six-fold in terms of world GDP (Chart 4).
2 Financial innovation has delivered considerable benefits. New products have
improved the ability to hedge and share risks and to tailor financial products more
precisely to user demand. That has enabled financial intermediaries and users of
financial services to manage financial risks more effectively, and has lowered the
costs of financial intermediation. And innovation and capital market integration have
facilitated the wider dispersal of risks, which may have increased the resilience of the
financial system to weather small to medium-sized shocks.
3 Innovation has also delivered new challenges and vulnerabilities. Dependence on
capital markets and on sustained market liquidity has increased, as banks and other
intermediaries place greater reliance on their ability to ‘originate and distribute’ loans
and other financial products, and to manage their risk positions dynamically as
economic and financial conditions alter. In turn that places additional pressure on the
robustness of financial market infrastructure to handle large changes in trading

2

volumes and to cope with periods of strain. And the greater integration of capital
markets means that if a major problem does arise it is more likely to spread quickly
across borders. So as highlighted by a number of academics and authorities,3 the flip
side to increased resilience of the financial system to small and medium-sized shocks
may be a greater vulnerability to less frequent but potentially larger financial crises.
4 Benign economic and financial conditions in recent years have kept credit losses at
low levels. Combined with buoyant returns from capital market activity, the
profitability of major financial institutions has been strong. And capital levels are
high. But as highlighted in Financial Stability Reports by the Bank of England and
others, this benign environment has encouraged an increase in risk-taking and a
‘search for yield’ which has lowered the compensation for bearing credit risk and
market risk to very low levels. The vulnerability of the system as a whole to an
abrupt change in conditions has consequently increased.
5 Against this background, I would like to focus my comments today on some of the
implications for the management and reduction of risks to the financial system as a
whole. More specifically, how can the public policy goal of promoting systemic
financial stability be best achieved? I will not provide a fully comprehensive answer
to this question but will touch briefly on four aspects; improving the assessment of
vulnerabilities that might threaten stability; developing appropriate buffers for capital
and liquidity within the financial system that take due account of the changing nature
of risks; strengthening the core market infrastructure; and lowering legal uncertainty.
Systemic stress-testing
6 As financial markets evolve and new vulnerabilities are exposed, it becomes
increasingly important that both market participants and the public authorities
improve their understanding and assessment of threats to financial stability, and take
steps, where appropriate, to contain and lower them.

7 The Bank of England has been active in the development of models to identify and
assess potential sources of major vulnerability to the UK financial system4 and is,
with the Financial Services Authority, engaged in a dialogue with practitioners, both
to understand better current approaches to measuring risks under stressed conditions
and to encourage improvements and the sharing of best practice in stress testing
techniques.
8 Recent distress in the US sub-prime lending market, and the collapse of the hedge
fund, Amaranth, have exposed weaknesses in risk management, including in the
management of contingent, or off-balance sheet, exposures. Although developments
in the sub-prime market of course continue to unfold, the impact on conditions in
broader financial markets has to date been relatively contained. But, in a more severe
stress scenario, perhaps in a more significant market such as corporate credit, or one
in which several areas of vulnerability were exposed in combination, the impact could
have more serious consequences for the financial system.
9

This highlights the potential value of a more rigorous assessment of tail-end risks.

In particular, stress-tests by financial institutions should attempt to incorporate the
behavioural responses of other firms which may have a substantial impact on market
conditions. For instance, scenarios should take account of the extent to which many
firms might respond to a common shock in a similar way, with potential implications
for market prices or market liquidity. The likely amplification of price moves as
financial institutions attempt to exit ‘crowded’ trades and liquidity dries up is an
important example.
10 Indeed, given the importance of market liquidity for the efficient execution of
banks’ dynamic hedging strategies and for their activities in the wholesale funding
and credit risk transfer (CRT) and securitisation markets, it is essential that stress tests
factor in extreme, yet plausible, scenarios for liquidity conditions in these markets,
recognising that market liquidity can evaporate very quickly, particularly for complex
structured financial instruments. And it is also essential to factor in increased

liquidity needs linked to contingent calls, associated, for instance, with funding
margin payments.
Capital and liquidity buffers
11 A sizeable buffer of capital and liquidity can help a bank to withstand a shock that
threatens its solvency or would otherwise leave it with insufficient liquidity to meet
its obligations as they fall due. But a bank’s private choice as to the size of its capital
or liquidity buffer may not be aligned with the socially optimal choice, as firms will
not naturally take account of (or ‘internalise’) the implications of their distress or
failure on the financial system more broadly – for example through the possibility of
contagion to other firms and impairment of the financial intermediation system. That
provides the justification for prudential regulation.
12 I will not dwell here on the value and importance of capital adequacy standards in
containing systemic risks – enough has been written on the Basel Accord and Basel II,
such that this is well understood.
13 However, consistent with my earlier comments on stress-testing and the
importance of modelling behavioural responses, it is crucial the authorities understand
banks’ likely responses to changes in minimum capital requirements over the business
cycle. In this regard, the Bank and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) have
recently developed a framework for monitoring the potential for pro-cyclicality in
credit conditions. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee
of European Banking Supervisors are working on similar frameworks internationally.
14 Capital adequacy standards are usefully complemented by ‘large exposures’ rules.
In particular, the application of such rules recognises the importance of addressing the
risks from an unforeseen event that could cause a bank to incur serious loss, and that
major problems could spill over from one bank to another given the network of
interconnections. A European Union-wide review of the Large Exposures Directive is
underway, offering the opportunity to improve the resilience of the financial system to
such spill overs, including in the inter-bank market.

5

15 Rather less has been written about liquidity buffers and prudential liquidity
standards. Given their balance-sheet structure, funding liquidity is a key risk for
banks: the transformation of short-term liabilities into long-term assets leaves them
structurally vulnerable to liquidity pressures. Banks therefore need to position
themselves so as to be able to withstand extraordinary demands on their liquidity.
If capital markets work efficiently, a solvent bank in need of liquidity should, in
principle, always be able to rely on the market to obtain funds. However, in practice,
the interbank market may not always work perfectly; asymmetric information and
coordination failures are among the most severe potential frictions. Banks may,
therefore, find themselves unable to access normal sources of funding liquidity. The
measures to which a bank in this situation would have to resort, such as large scale
asset sales, could have major adverse spill over effects through the system, as could
the most extreme case of an outright failure to meet obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity buffers may help in this regard: a bank holding a buffer of assets that is
reliably liquid under conditions of stress, perhaps with a core component that is
eligible as collateral at the central bank, should always be able to access liquidity in a
way that avoids precipitating severe market disruption.
16 The trends described at the outset are also important here. First, a shift to greater
reliance on wholesale funding and greater involvement in capital market activity more
broadly perhaps makes banks more exposed to funding liquidity pressures than in the
past: they are at the mercy of nimble wholesale lenders. And with internationally
active banks managing multi-currency balance sheets, a local approach to liquidity
regulation is becoming less relevant. It is for this reason that the Basel Committee for
Banking Supervision decided to convene a Liquidity Working Group to take stock of
prudential approaches internationally and to explore whether there is a case for greater
consistency.
The critical role of infrastructure
17 The financial market infrastructure – exchanges and the systems used to clear and
settle market trades or cash obligations – also plays a critical role here. Market
participants rely on such infrastructure to implement their desired portfolio allocation;

6

to execute risk management strategies; to raise liquidity, both in normal course and in
times of stress; and to manage contingent exposures and cash-flows. It is therefore
important for financial stability that these systems function efficiently and
continuously, and do not introduce unnecessary costs, risks or frictions to trading and
post-trade processes. Frequent interruptions to pre- or post-trade processing, or
excessive costs in accessing core components of the market infrastructure, can impose
significant welfare costs. Under such circumstances, agents may be forced to deviate
from their desired portfolio allocations and risk exposures, or indeed may be
prevented from meeting their obligations as they fall due. With markets for credit risk
transfer (CRT) growing rapidly, there has been an expansion in the range of
transactions for which robust, resilient and well-designed infrastructure is essential.
Market failures in infrastructure provision and single points of failure
18 It is instructive to consider why providers of the market infrastructure and their
members might, left to their own devices, invest too little in resilience and riskmitigation. The answer lies in the microeconomics of infrastructure provision, and, in
particular, the presence of market characteristics such as network externalities,
increasing returns to scale and coordination failures.
19 By network externality, I refer to the incremental benefit derived by existing
owners of a particular good or service when another party purchases that good or
service. For instance, the broader the participation in a particular exchange or trading
facility, the more extensive the trading opportunities and the deeper the liquidity; as a
result, the greater the potential benefits from membership of that exchange. Equally,
in the case of post-trade infrastructure – clearing and settlement systems – the greater
the volume of transactions cleared or settled, the greater the potential for netting
exposures and/or cash-flows (or in gross payment and settlement systems, the more
efficiently liquidity can be recycled).
20 Increasing returns to scale reflect the fact that infrastructure provision is, by and
large, a fixed-cost business: once an investment has been made in the information
technology supporting the trade, clearing or settlement of a given volume of

7

transactions, the marginal cost of each transaction up to the capacity of the system is
very low.
21 But the market characteristics imply a tendency towards natural monopoly in the
provision of infrastructural services and hence dependence on a single, nonsubstitutable provider: often termed a ‘single point of failure.’ A monopolist provider
of infrastructure services may face insufficient incentive to innovate – including in
risk-reduction – and, importantly, may not fully internalise the potential effects of a
disruption to its services on the financial system as a whole, thereby undervaluing
system resilience from a public policy perspective.
22 But couldn’t the users of the infrastructure ensure that the monopoly provider
invested more heavily in risk mitigation? And with many infrastructures being userowned cooperatives, would there not be a natural mechanism for this?
23 Perhaps – and indeed there is evidence of effective risk-mitigation among userowned providers, for example the throughput guidelines on payment flows to lower
liquidity risk in CHAPS, the UK high value RTGS payment system, was led by
member initiative. But such risk mitigation may still not be enough to meet social
welfare goals fully.
24 First, the effects of a disruption are likely to be felt beyond what may be a narrow
group of direct users of the infrastructure. That is, the effects may be systemic; for
instance, there may be an interruption to the flow of liquidity via dependent markets
or systems, or among participants relying on the system indirectly, for example
through a correspondent banking relationship.
25 Second, users may place insufficient value on systemic stability because material
operational failures are low-probability events and difficult to anticipate. Their
assessment horizon may also be shorter than the social optimum.
26 And, crucially, coordination failures may be a factor: users of a particular
infrastructure, many of whom may compete in underlying markets, need to coordinate
their actions if they are to influence decisions on the future strategy of the

8

infrastructure provider. Investment in the reduction of operational risk will be one
such decision. Difficulties in organising effective bargaining among users may leave
them unable to coordinate, particularly in the face of differences in their information,
expectations or preferences. Potential welfare-increasing actions may, therefore, not
be carried out.
27 These market failures may justify intervention by the public authorities: either via
a continuous oversight or regulatory regime; via targeted intervention; or maybe even
via public ownership, as is often the case in respect of large-value payment systems
and sometimes with securities settlement systems. An alternative strategy when faced
with a monopoly provider might be to promote (or even set up) alternative, competing
suppliers, to improve market contestability while ensuring adequate interoperability
and substitutability across systems. Of course, given the existence of network
externalities and increasing returns to scale, the cost of this form of risk mitigation
may well be higher than the cost of regulating a natural monopoly on an ongoing
basis.
28 Most typically, public intervention would seek to address the vulnerability
stemming from single points of failure by the imposition of minimum standards of
resilience on monopoly (or near-monopoly) systems, either to reduce the probability
of operational failure; or to mitigate the impact of such failure by improving
contingency arrangements – for instance, via increased investment in back-up
facilities. Steps might also be taken to improve general risk management practices
and mitigate the risk of exit of a key infrastructure; financial resilience and business
risk is an important consideration here.
29 A regulator or overseer might also (or alternatively) seek to narrow the gap
between the choices of a monopoly provider and the social optimum by encouraging
more effective and inclusive governance arrangements. User- as opposed to externalownership might be promoted, though, as previously noted, this might not be enough.
Other measures might include steps to clarify the scope of the system’s activities,
admissions criteria, voting rights, transparency, and the role of external stakeholders.

9

30 For instance, in the UK, overall governance of payment systems is carried out via
the newly-formed Payments Council. This body is headed by a governing board
comprising a (non-voting) independent Chair, four independent directors, and eleven
directors from the payments sector. The board is expected to consult with key
stakeholders before determining strategy, and before making important decisions.
Transparency is also enhanced via the publication of an annual report, with a separate
contribution by the independent directors, and the publication of board minutes.
31 Finally, we should not underestimate the importance of users themselves building
resilience within their own operations to single points of failure in infrastructures. For
the very same reasons that monopoly infrastructure providers may tend to underinvest in resilience from a public policy perspective, even where run as user-owned
cooperatives, financial institutions might also need supervisory encouragement to
invest in work-around measures to deal with disruptions at the level of the core
infrastructure.
Other sources of systemic risk
32 The existence of single points of failure is not the only manifestation of systemic
risk in infrastructures, as the behaviour of agents within the systems can lead to
problems spilling over to other participants given the interconnections and strategic
interactions. For example, if a large net provider of liquidity to a real-time gross
settlement payment system were to face severe operational difficulties which left it
unable to make payments, other banks within the system might find themselves short
of liquidity, and, in extremis, some might be unable to meet their own payment
obligations. Behavioural responses, such as payment delays and liquidity-hoarding,
might then exacerbate the problem within the payment system, potentially also
spilling over to activity in other systems and financial markets. And, where a system
is integral to the implementation of monetary policy, a disruption could directly affect
a central bank’s ability to set overnight rates and maintain confidence in the currency.
33 Although this variant of systemic risk does not originate directly in infrastructures,
system design can, nonetheless, help mitigate the impact. Features of the design and
operation of an infrastructure can help to lower risks of this type – for example, by

10

introducing collateralisation and loss-sharing rules, net sender limits and throughput
guidelines to promote efficient liquidity recycling – so that failures do not give rise to
financial contagion. Again, left to their own devices, users will lack an incentive to
take into account fully the costs imposed outside of the system and they again face
acoordination challenge in effectively implementing system design or rule changes to
reduce such effects.
Infrastructure robustness and the changing nature of risks
34 Some of the financial market trends identified earlier have placed additional
pressure on potential shortcomings in the financial infrastructure, attracting the
interest of the public authorities and, in some cases, prompting targeted intervention.
I would like to discuss two of these: financial market innovation; and the global
linkages and system interdependencies that arise from the emergence of large crossborder banking groups.
Financial market innovation
35 Taking the first of these, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets have grown
rapidly in recent years, particularly in the credit sector, driven in part by the shift
towards an ‘originate and distribute’ model of banking finance and by greater
recourse to credit risk transfer to manage and hedge risks, as well as increasing
activity by insurance companies, hedge funds and institutional investors in this sector.
The infrastructure for OTC derivatives has, however, lagged behind.
36 Notwithstanding the emergence of new automated vendor services in recent years,
OTC derivatives trades continue to be cleared and settled on a predominantly bilateral
basis. Hence, a party to such a transaction is dependent upon the ongoing creditworthiness, liquidity and operational robustness of its counterparty over the life of the
contract. A sound legal basis for the trade is, of course, also critical. Rising volumes
(and values) and the development of new, and often more complex, products have
placed a strain on existing arrangements, exposing capacity constraints in existing
procedures. Questions have also been raised over the risk implications of deficiencies
in post-trade processes, most notably in the assignment of credit derivatives contracts.

11

37 Progress towards addressing these deficiencies was initially relatively slow, held
back by coordination failures in the dealer community, until the regulatory
community took an interest in 2005. The issue was noted in the Bank of England
Financial Stability Review and the UK’s Financial Services Authority helped to bring
the issue to public attention. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) later
convened a group of 14 dealers and their regulators, encouraging them to set targets
for the reduction of processing backlogs in credit derivatives and to put in place
mechanisms for speedier post-trade processing going forward. The dealers were
encouraged to embrace existing automated services for the delivery and matching of
confirmations, and the industry was propelled rapidly towards the adoption of a
Protocol for communicating trade assignments. The group was also encouraged to
work with vendors, notably the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC),
to implement solutions providing a framework for ongoing processing efficiency and
data integrity. The result was the launch, in November 2006, of DTCC’s Trade
Information Warehouse.
38 In parallel, the Basel Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems has been
investigating developments in the OTC derivatives space more generally, updating
work carried out in 1998 to map the landscape and identify risk issues. The
Committee published a report in March 2007.
39 The report recognises that the clearing and settlement infrastructure has been
strengthened significantly in recent years, noting, in particular, the progress in
automating and centralising key post-trade functions. But the report also highlights
that there is more to be done. For instance, while processing backlogs in credit
derivatives have been reduced substantially, they remain sizeable in other product
lines. Recognising that the group convened by the FRBNY has been effective in
resolving co-ordination problems, the report argues that momentum from the credit
initiative should be carried across to other products. An initiative is already under
way in this regard, with the FRBNY group having been expanded to 17 firms and a
broader range of products. Firms are working towards targets for backlog reduction.
Automation is a key element of this initiative, although it is recognised that there

12

needs to be interoperability between core vendor services if the benefits are to be
realised.
40 One implication is that further public intervention might be required should
coordination problems undermine the incentives to deliver such interoperability. And,
as the OTC derivatives market becomes more dependent upon centralised providers of
post-trade services, public authorities will need to consider whether established
international standards for operational reliability of infrastructures should be applied
to emerging new systems.
Global linkages and system interdependencies
41 The rapid growth of capital market integration and of large cross-border banking
groups (often termed large complex financial institutions or LCFIs) and the increased
international linkage between infrastructure providers also has significant implications
for the assessment and reduction of systemic risk arising in or from the financial
infrastructure. Specifically in an Anglo-Swiss context, for instance, we have seen
Switzerland's SWX Group establish in London back in 2001 the recognised
investment exchange, virt-x, as a cross-border trading platform, which offers central
counterparty (CCP) clearing with both LCH.Clearnet Ltd and SIS x-clear AG, and
settlement through CrestCo Ltd, Euroclear Bank and SIS SegaInterSettle AG. The
Swiss CCP, x-clear, also plans to join LCH.Clearnet Ltd in clearing the London Stock
Exchange.
42 Infrastructure providers have responded positively to the demands of an
increasingly internationally oriented customer base by offering settlement links –
which facilitate cross-border collateral and liquidity management – and clearing links
– which allow margin offset with respect to positions held in related assets in different
centres.
43 Cross-border mergers between infrastructures are also becoming more common.
For example, in recent years, the UK’s central counterparty for derivatives, London
Clearing House (LCH) Limited merged with Clearnet SA, while the Euroclear Group
acquired CREST, the securities settlement system for the UK and Ireland. The

13

Euroclear Group currently provides domestic securities settlement services in 5
European countries as well as international settlement services. Such tie-ups are of
course an international extension of the microeconomics of infrastructure provision
outlined above, exploiting economies of scale and network externalities. But, at the
same time, they introduce common business risks and cross-border dependence on
core systems, thus providing another channel for problems to spill across borders.
Such cross-border linkages consequently add a layer of complexity to supervisory
arrangements, making international coordination among the public authorities
essential.
44 Linkages arising at the user level are again important here. As banks operate in
multiple markets, there is increasing scope for shocks to propagate across borders.
That may arise from the increased centralisation of banks’ liquidity risk management.
To the extent that banks use the foreign exchange markets to recycle surplus liquidity
in one system to meet a shortfall in another, or else take advantage of settlement links
between securities settlement systems to transfer collateral across borders, liquidity
risk may be reduced. But, to the extent that banks respond to the availability of
mechanisms for reallocating liquidity between systems by reducing their aggregate
holdings, a bank may be more vulnerable to simultaneous liquidity demands across
markets or to operational disruption to such mechanisms.
45 The Basel Committee for Payment and Settlement Systems has again been
looking closely at issues arising from international integration of banks and
infrastructures. In recent years, the Committee has published a report exploring
mechanisms for the cross-border use of collateral, and in the context of a broader
report on central bank oversight of payment and settlement systems, has established a
set of principles for international cooperative oversight. Work is also continuing to
map more formally the nature of international interdependencies between systems,
and thus of cross-border risks.

14

Legal certainty
46 No matter how safe and resilient the market infrastructure, a sound legal basis for
transactions is essential if the financial markets are to fulfil their role in effectively
allocating scarce capital.
47 Financial markets operate within legal systems that not only regulate the
behaviour of participants for the good of the markets as a whole, but also safeguard
the property and contractual rights of those participants. Prospective market
participants will have greater confidence to invest or to seek finance if they feel
confident, first, that the regulatory obligations and sanctions imposed upon them are
predictable and, second, that the contractual rights/obligations which they
acquire/undertake can be identified with certainty.
48 Furthermore, market discipline is likely to be enhanced if participants’
legal/contractual rights and obligations are precisely defined; the introduction of an
ambiguity into the law can unsettle financial markets or exacerbate existing
instabilities. Legal/contractual uncertainty is therefore a potential source of systemic
risk. Two aspects of legal certainty are particularly crucial:
Contractual certainty
49 One key element of a stable legal framework is contractual certainty. Systems of
contract law that show respect for formal agreements help to drive down commercial
risk and therefore to promote the efficient allocation of capital. And uncertainty as to
the enforceability of contracts is likely to be particularly damaging to financial
markets. Against this background, contracts are becoming longer and more complex
as financial innovation continues apace: the documentation for a structured finance
product can often run into several hundred pages, thus raising the important issue of
‘documentation’ risk.
Legal and regulatory stability
50 Another key element is legal and regulatory stability. This is very important to
the financial markets, where the ability to form complex plans with a degree of

15

confidence as to the stability over time of external influences (such as legal rules)
impacts directly on risk, price and, ultimately, the efficient allocation of capital. A
stable planning environment is conducive to investment and, therefore, market
growth. Examples of harmful consequences of ambiguities in legal/regulatory
frameworks include uncertainty as to the extent and scope of regulatory obligations or
sanctions, and uncertainty as to how old laws will apply to dynamic and fast-changing
market practices.
The Financial Markets Law Committee (FMLC)
51 In recognition of this, a number of countries have established groups of experts to
promote greater legal certainty in financial markets. In the UK, the Financial Markets
Law Committee was established in 2002. Its objective was to identify issues of legal
uncertainty which might give rise to material risks, and to consider how such issues
might best be addressed. The Committee seeks to meet this objective, first, via liaison
with industry and market participants to identify those areas of legal uncertainty with
potentially adverse impacts, and, second, by working with market experts to propose
solutions.
52 One area in which the FMLC has been active in recent years is in encouraging the
development of a smoothly functioning legal framework for cross-border transfers of
intermediated securities. In 2005, the Committee undertook a thorough analysis of
the advantages and disadvantages of harmonisation of the private international law in
this area, as reflected in the Hague Convention. It was, and still is, widely accepted
that such harmonisation would contribute to legal certainty by facilitating a clear
identification of the law governing the holding and transfer of indirectly-held
securities. This is particularly important in the context of the cross-border use of
collateral: a key element of banks’ global liquidity management strategies. Early
in2006, the FMLC published a paper that undertook a full analysis of the Convention
and expressed strong support for its central propositions.
53 The FMLC’s work in this (and other) areas has been well received and has
contributed to the decision-making process for government at the national and supra-

16

national level. Indeed, overall, the Committee has had some notable successes in
addressing and ameliorating legal uncertainty in the financial markets context.
Concluding remarks
54 To conclude, the rapid structural change in global financial markets is providing
considerable benefits to users of financial services, by lowering the costs of financial
intermediation and improving the ability to manage and hedge financial risks and
tailor financial products. But recent developments also provide new challenges and
sources of vulnerability as financial markets become increasingly integrated, and as
participants place increased reliance on sustained market liquidity to manage their
risks. While financial institutions are in a strong financial position, risk taking has
increased and the vulnerability of the financial system as a whole to a sharp change in
conditions has risen. Against this background, and given the considerable uncertainty
regarding how many new complex financial products would perform in more strained
market conditions, it is important to improve the analysis and understanding of tail
risks through systemic stress tests and thereby strengthen risk management, to ensure
that financial institutions retain strong buffers of capital and liquidity, and that
investment in the financial and legal infrastructure keeps pace with market
developments and thus ensures that it remains robust and resilient.
