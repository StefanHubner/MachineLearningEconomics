The soft tyranny of inflation expectations
Speech given by
Adam Posen, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England
At Oxonia Distinguished Lecture, Oxford
22 February 2011

Even more than usual, I have benefitted from the input of colleagues at the Bank of England in
formulating my views and in interpreting the available data in preparation of this lecture. I would like to
thank - without implicating - the members of the MPC, as well as Alex Brazier, Matt Corder, Danny
Eckloff, Phil Evans, Neal Hatch, Tomas Hellebrandt, Jake Horwood, Brunello Rosa, Chris Salmon,
Tom Smith, Tim Taylor, Matt Trott, and Kenny Turnbull. Tomas Hellebrandt also provided excellent
research assistance and marshaled a wide range of materials. The views expressed here and any
remaining errors of fact or interpretation are solely my own, and not those of the MPC, the Bank, or of
PIIE.

Walter Bagehot
–

I am delighted to be speaking here tonight as part of the Oxford Institute for Economic Policy’s series of talks
aiming to bring insights from academic research into the broader public policy discussion. I am grateful to
Domenico Lombardi for thinking of me for this forum, to Oxford Economics for its support of this series, and
to my esteemed predecessor on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee [MPC], Professor
Stephen Nickell, for chairing tonight’s event. I am a little daunted, not just by Steve’s presence but also by
our location and especially by this sophisticated audience, to presume that I could bring academic insights
here. So what I would like to offer tonight as, I hope, a contribution to both future economic research and
policymaking is a discussion of how I think influential academic models meet up with real-time data in the UK
at present, and what guidance I take from that exchange when forecasting UK inflation over the mediumterm.
My specific topic tonight is the role of inflation expectations, and how and when monetary policymakers
should respond to observed movements (or lack of movements) in them. Of course, the broad subject of
expectations and inflation has been one of the core issues of macroeconomics since Friedman and Phelps
predicted the instability of the Phillips curve if exploited. This centrality carried through the development of
rational expectations and time-inconsistency models to become the focus of most monetary policy models
today. At the core of most theoretical understandings of what credible monetary commitments do is to
anchor inflation expectations around a known low level. (Bernanke, et al (1999); Svensson (2011)). In
empirical research as well as policy analysis, a vast literature of econometric techniques and results has
accumulated assessing the behavior of inflation expectations through changes in monetary regimes and
economic conditions.1 The message of all this work is that the successful maintenance of price stability
requires keeping long-run inflation expectations at the desired level, as economic shocks and policy mistakes
come and go.
So far, so good, and during the so-called ‘Great Moderation’ it seemed pretty easy for central banks to
maintain those expectations of low inflation. Perhaps the ease in so doing was due to good monetary
policies, or perhaps to the absence of large economic shocks, or to the liberalization of labor and other
markets, or to reduced importance of energy prices to growth, but probably due to some combination thereof.
(Blanchard and Gali (2007)) Inflation targeting was rightly seen as a framework conducive to attaining this
result of anchored long-run inflation expectations. There was theory and evidence for a positive feedback in
which the anchoring of inflation expectations through targets enabled central banks to respond more flexibly
to shocks than under less credible monetary regimes, and that resulted in less persistence in the economy of
any deviations of inflation from its expected long-term level. (Kuttner and Posen (1998))

Now, the British economy has been beset by a series of significant shocks in a relatively short period of time
– the global financial crisis, domestic real estate and banking failures, a step depreciation of Sterling, a leap
in energy and food prices, and a fiscal consolidation (including VAT increases that raise measured inflation).
As shown in Figure 1, CPI inflation has been meaningfully above the MPC’s mandated target of 2% at an
annual rate for the last three years or more. Should members of the MPC be worried that long-term inflation
expectations will come unanchored? Should the MPC take action to tighten policy out of regard for inflation
expectations even though the committee’s just published forecast (Bank of England (2011a)) is that inflation
is as likely to be below as above target in two years’ time? Putting the issue in more general terms, is deanchoring of inflation expectations a realistic risk to inflation outcomes when the medium-term forecast
based on information available to all economic agents is that inflation will be at (or evenly distributed around)
target, absent an exogenous rise inflation expectations contrary to the forecast? Do all movements in
inflation expectations always get fully transmitted into inflation outcomes? Should monetary policy respond
to the chance of inflation expectations rising as a distinct risk?
I will argue tonight that long-term UK inflation expectations in financial markets are far better anchored than
some commentators appreciate. I also will present analysis suggesting that observed recent movements in
short-term household inflation expectations will not affect wage bargaining, and so will not push up inflation
outcomes. While all market determined interest rates and exchange rates are subject to sudden changes in
sentiment, I believe that the MPC should not set policy in fear of such potential changes, given the solid longterm fundamentals of the UK economy. All indications to date are that British and global investors broadly
share the correct interpretation that recent above target UK inflation will not necessarily lead to future above
target inflation and that the MPC will do what is necessary to return inflation to target over the medium-term.
Therefore, it is my contention that the MPC should set policy based on a forecast that does assume longterm inflation expectations are anchored at the target level. Certainly, I believe that the MPC should not build
into its forecasts an arbitrary rise in inflation due to an expectations shift that is not there, and should not
tighten policy solely in response to such supposed expectations.
I do not take for granted that anchoring of long-term inflation expectations in the UK just because we (or I)
say that people should be reassured – rather, I believe that there is strong empirical precedent as well as
logic that such anchoring will be undiminished by recent inflation outcomes, given the causes and context of
those overshoots. Markets and more slowly but painfully households are coming to recognize that we are
living in a world today of greater economic volatility than was seen in the Great Moderation. That change in
economic conditions is not due to erosion of central bank credibility. If anything, the justified downgrading of
monetary policy’s importance as a determinant of past good outcomes implies a greater recognition of the
role that the infrequency of non-policy shocks played in generating the past stability. And we are less lucky
than we were.
The importance of inflation expectations does not mean that widely held and expressed expectations are
always right, let alone are self-fulfilling in outcomes. That is one key way in which monetary policy in practice

has to differ from the simple models of time-inconsistency and inflation targeting where there is no distinction
between types of agents holding expectations and there is immediate transmission from expectations to
inflation outcomes. More recent academic research has usefully begun to unpack these assumptions and to
confront them with data.2 It is in this sense that I invoke de Tocqueville’s spirit and Bagehot’s quote
regarding democratic despotism. Monetary policymakers must not be tyrannized by popular opinion,
especially if the public is to be well-served.

Starting With a Reasonable Forecast for UK Inflation –
The issue that I have identified for policy depends upon the assumption that the central bank makes a good
unbiased forecast for inflation, and that it is not tricking people about its intentions.3 For understandable
reasons, that assumption is being questioned with regard to the MPC’s forecasting track record of late. As
some MPC colleagues and I have argued, we do need to learn from our mistakes, but the mistakes should
not be exaggerated and must not be misunderstood.4 A year ago, the MPC forecast a rate of inflation nearly
3% points lower than what we have today. Part of that gap was due to the VAT rise, which by legitimate
convention we could not put into our forecasts until whoever won the election (in May) announced what they
would do with fiscal policy. Part of that gap was due to the rise in commodity prices, which by sensible
convention we use futures market prices to forecast (see Bank of England (2011a), p. 43), and a year ago
were set to remain flat. And part of that gap between forecast and outcome was due to our getting wrong
the pass through effect on UK inflation from the 25% depreciation of Sterling in 2007-08 – that being the
primary error which we need to learn from and take responsibility for, as I have publicly stated (Posen (2010d
and e)).5
Figure 2 presents a version of core inflation for UK, one that takes CPI-Y (which removes the impact of
indirect taxes) and adjusts for the direct impact of energy prices. The remaining amount that this measure of
core inflation is above its long-run average of 1.5% is roughly our forecast error that we should try to improve
upon. Two things become apparent looking at this chart: one, that the period of high inflation beyond the
direct or first-round impact of VAT and energy prices has ended, and the timing of the surge adds
reasonability to ascribing our error to the depreciation of Sterling (given that the rough forecast error reached
a high of 2.5% in early 2009 roughly a year after the fall began); two, that in the absence of any ex post
sensible estimate of impact of the exchange rate movement, core inflation would have been below its long-

2

I have in mind here particularly the work of Greg Mankiw and Ricardo Reis and their co-authors on ‘sticky information’
and ‘inattentive’ economic agents, though there are several approaches to this issue in play. See the empirical analysis
as well as critical literature review in Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2010).
3
In the case of the MPC, that would be each member individually making their own forecast. The goal of all MPC
members is to meet our mandated inflation target.
4
See, among others, Bank of England (2011b); Fisher (2010); King (2011); Posen (2010e).
5
I am glossing over some technical issues, and more importantly assessments of the degree to which VAT and energy
prices are passed through. I would assert that the range of reasonable estimates of those do not have first order effects
on inflation outcomes, and that in a time when companies’ margins were compressed by labor hoarding and declining
productivity, high pass through of price shocks was reasonable to expect.

run trend (that assumed consistent with meeting target headline CPI inflation in the future). This core
inflation measure is again below that trend at present.
This is consistent with the fundamental starting point of the MPC’s February forecast – as well as with the
results of mainstream empirical economics (Meier (2010); Posen (2010e); Stock and Watson (2010)) - that in
the aftermath of the recession and financial crisis there is still an output gap in the UK, and that the output
gap is pushing down on inflation. Economists, including members of the MPC, can have different estimates
over some range for the size of the current UK output gap and what the trend rate of productivity will be
when that output gap closes, but do agree on this starting point that the gap is greater than zero and that
most of trend productivity growth will return. (Bean (2010), Dale (2010), King (2011), Posen (2010a,b,c),
Weale (2010)) Obviously, there is more to generating a specific forecast distribution of inflation than just
that, including estimating parameters, respecting adding up relationships, considering the transmission of
current monetary policy settings to credit markets, and making judgments about investor and consumer
behavior. On those aspects of the forecast, however, there is little reason to doubt that the MPC makes
sensible robust estimates, with the benefit of analyses by the Bank’s staff and by outside analysts. Again,
we got one big thing wrong, the impact of Sterling’s past depreciation, which we have to learn from. But
Sterling has been stable since January 2009, and should not be a source of new errors over the inflation
forecast horizon.
My own personal forecast for inflation differs from the forecast in the February Inflation Report [IR] in two
significant ways. First, as I set out in Posen (2010e), I believe that private consumption growth will be lower
because of increased savings by households and of the impact of fiscal consolidation, and that will push
inflation below target. Second, as I will set out tonight, I do not believe that there will be upwards pressure
on wages due to increased inflation expectations, so inflation will be lower than it is in a forecast which
assumes non-negligible ‘real wage resistance,’ as the current forecast presented in the IR does. (Bank of
England (2011a,b) This means, however, that I believe that the current MPC forecast for UK inflation in
2013-14 is too high, not too low, and that I am not challenging the fundamental basis of the forecast, just
differing on the estimate of two parameters (albeit admittedly important ones). As a result, I am perfectly
comfortable stating that the MPC forecast is a far more reasonable basis for making policy than forecasts
which presume that the distribution of likely inflation outcomes is mostly above target in two years’ time.
That allows me to turn now to the question of assessing inflation expectations, their anchoring, and their
impact in the UK economy today.

Taking Short-Term Inflation Expectations Less Seriously –
The Bank of England has long been at the forefront, even among inflation targeting central banks, of tracking
and publishing measures of inflation expectations. Table 1 presents a summary of the major ones the Bank
publicly tracks in the IR and elsewhere. To give a sense of whether inflation expectations have moved
upwards, the right two columns show the difference between latest readings on a given measure and the

average for that measure over 1997-2007 (from start of the MPC to the crisis) and over 2002-2007 (the
height of the Great Moderation).6 There are two measures that do show increases of over 1% in inflation
expectations versus their long-run averages, both surveys of one-year ahead expectations by households,
and I have highlighted these on the table. The other directly comparable survey of consumers, Barclays
Basix one-year, has risen by less than 0.4% versus each average, within the range of normal variation.
Neither the surveys of longer-term consumer inflation expectations, nor of professional forecasters’ views,
nor the inflation expectations extracted from gilt market instruments have increased beyond normal variation
in the series. (See Figures 4-9; I will return to these in more detail) This development is largely consistent
with households forming their short-term inflation expectations either in an adaptive backwards looking
manner, using (a moving average) of latest inflation outcomes to predict inflation. (Posen (2010b))
What about households potentially beginning to doubt the MPC’s (or so-labelled ‘dovish’ members’ like me)
commitment to the 2% inflation target? That would require a pretty strenuous over-interpretation of this data,
with some very specific assumptions. Consider Figure 3, which plots the cumulative change in UK CPI since
1997, when the MPC was formed, as compared to a path if inflation had been steady at the mandated 2% a
year.7 The picture shows clearly that the MPC undershot the inflation target for most of the time since 1997.8
We saw no sustained movements in household short-term inflation expectations downwards below the
mandate target as a result of this repeated undershooting. Why should that suddenly occur now, especially
when most households do understand that much (not all) of the declining real income they are suffering with
is due to VAT and energy price increases, which will not persist?
Of course, the average consumer can decide to focus on only more recent data when formulating
expectations, but that would take us back to where I started: that recent data determines short-term
consumer inflation expectations, and there is no sign of a memory effect beyond that. If that is the case,
then there is no reason to think that consumer inflation expectations will remain elevated once inflation
outturns begin to decline, as both the February forecast and I personally believe they will (and as Figure 2
suggests they already are ex-VAT and energy). Similarly as shown in Figure 6, the CBI survey of nonfinancial firms’ own one-year ahead pricing intentions (and only recently of inflation expectations) also has
returned to its long-run average, rather than displaying a cumulative memory of past overshoots (and
undershoots). There are more sophisticated models of more sophisticated learning by household agents – I
particularly favor those building on the approach of Carroll (2003) – but even these suggest that inflation
expectations are transmitted from revisions of more expert expectations, and are only updated at intervals or
after large shocks.

6

The right reference is the series average, which has been consistent with on average target inflation outcomes over the
1997-2007 period (not versus 2%), because of variations in series construction.
7
Yes, I know the target was defined in terms of RPIX for part of that period. This is an illustration.
8
No, this does not mean that I or any other MPC member is targeting the price level. Again, this is just an illustration
(and anyway, it should be clear from this picture that we are not doing so).

We have had large shocks, but if they led to revisions in households’ assessment of the overall monetary
regime – that the actual inflation target had risen or that the MPC’s commitment to it had fallen - that should
show up in upward revisions of long-run inflation expectations as well if not more so than in the short-term
expectations. And it has not. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 5, there is no sign of sustained or meaningful
increase in long-term inflation expectations by households, at least according to those survey measures we
have available. It is outcomes for British citizens that we care about, and that is the reason for the MPC’s
commitment to the inflation target and to price stability. But putting the welfare of British citizens foremost
does not imply taking them seriously as macroeconomic forecasters. If fact, pursuing the interest of the
average citizen requires central banks to properly discount fluctuations in those citizens short-term inflation
expectations.

Financial Markets Indicate Greater Economic (Not Monetary) Uncertainty –
I will now turn to financial market indicators of inflation expectations. These merit a bit more discussion,
because they can offer more dimensions of analysis than whether or not they have risen versus their longrun averages. But first, it is worth repeating that financial market measures of longer-term inflation
expectations have not risen of late. Figure 8 looks at inflation expectations computed from swaps and from
the inflation indexed gilt market, five years ahead, and there is no sign of any trend increase in inflation
expectations since Sterling depreciated, we made our forecasting error in that regard, and inflation overshot
target.9 This is sensible – one need not believe in extreme versions of the efficient markets hypothesis (and I
certainly do not) to think that traders with money at stake in the deepest most transparent Sterlingdenominated markets, i.e., gilts and related instruments, will get forecasts right on average. Today that
means understanding the economics of temporary shocks moving inflation, as set out in King (2011) or Bank
of England (2011b), and consistent with my discussion Figure 2 above.
This conclusion might be somewhat too reassuring. The MPC has long focused on publishing in the IR
computations of inflation expectations five-years ahead due to availability of data, depth of market, and
simply wanting to stick with the same measure over time. Yet, it is possible that even if the longer-term
inflation expectations remain anchored, there might be doubts emerging about the willingness of the current
MPC to bring inflation back to target within the current horizon, or at least so some City commentators claim.
To try to get at this possibility, we have analyzed in a similar manner the two-year, three-year forward swaps
and indexed gilts, presented in Figure 9. While this part of the market is thinner, so the assessment should
not be considered as robust as that with the five-year, five-year, this chart seems to be pretty clear: no trend
rise in inflation expectations at the three-year horizon either.
It is worth pointing out that in a standard model of inflation targeting, there can be differing degrees of
gradualism in returning inflation to any given target when shocks hit the economy. (Svensson (2011)) In
9

Descriptions of how these measures are computed are available in Bank of England (2011a). As with the survey
measures, in terms of levels, what matters is changes versus the average of the series.

these models, there is nothing inherently corrosive to credibility about adopting a more gradualist approach,
depending upon the nature and size of the shock the monetary policymaker faces. Normatively, I and other
MPC members have already implicitly adopted case for a gradual return of inflation to target over the
medium-term (which has been explained more explicitly now in Bank of England (2011b) and King (2011) as
also consistent with the MPC’s remit). If I agreed fully with the forecast in the February IR, I could still
support keeping the current policy stance unchanged for that reason. The important point for tonight’s
discussion of expectations, however, is positive, not normative. There is evidence that financial markets can
update their estimates of Svensson’s lambda (the degree of gradualism) when central banks which adopt a
gradual approach in returning inflation to target after a major shock without inflation expectations becoming
de-anchored.
The quintessential example is the Deutsche Bundesbank’s response to the oil-shock and global recession of
1979-80.10 The Bundesbank made public that it would take several years to bring inflation back to its target
long-run inflation level, even though it would partially offset the shock immediately and inflation would rise. In
fact, it took six years for German inflation to be brought back to 2%, and both the Deutsche Mark and the
Bundesbank retained their counter-inflationary credibility. If financial markets were to right now be updating
their estimates of the MPC’s composite lambda, especially given the absence of large supply shocks during
the first decade of the MPC’s existence on which to base those estimates, this would strike me as rational
not worrisome. So it makes sense to me that financial market measures of long-term inflation expectations
for our economy have remained stable as information has come in.
I believe, though, we can learn more from examination of these financial market measures. Figure 10 shows
estimated gilt market beliefs about UK inflation uncertainty and the probability of high inflation outcomes
derived from option prices. Again, one would not want to rely solely on this pair of estimated measures to
justify an assessment of policy, but the figure certainly has some information to offer us. The four- to fiveyear ahead weight on RPI inflation (what these trade) being >5% has come off its highs of late 2009, and has
stayed at a lower level for the last six months than any time since the start of 2009 (though justifiably is
elevated versus the pre-crisis estimates). Meanwhile, the measure of four- to five-year ahead option implied
inflation uncertainty has continued to rise, albeit at a diminishing rate. Similarly, as shown in figure 7, the
Bank’s survey of professional forecasters’ estimates of the chances that inflation may be more than 1%
above or below target is well above its pre-crisis levels, though off its highs of last year.11 Figure 11 presents
another assessment of inflation uncertainty versus inflation expectations from financial instruments. Breakeven inflation rates (i.e., expected rates of inflation implicit in the market prices of the given inflation indexed
gilts and swaps) have fluctuated around a steady level since late 2007, meaning they have not risen after the
inflation target overshoots. Meanwhile, swaption volatility for these products, that is the market price implied
estimate of UK inflation volatility going forward, has risen quite a lot between late 2008 and early 2009, and
stayed at that elevated level. Usually, measures of inflation level and volatility are positively correlated, for
10

This episode is analyzed in detail in Laubach and Posen (1997).
This is not to imply that these forecasters think at the moment that the likelihood of being >1% above target is the
same as that of being >1% below target, although for four or five years ahead that is probably true.

both macroeconomic and technical reasons. So the rise in swaption volatility without a rise in break-even
inflation rates would if anything be a clearer than usual signal that estimated volatility has increased without
any increase in uncertainty about the inflation target over the medium-term.
I find the idea that financial markets are pricing in greater inflation uncertainty going forward for the UK
versus that perceived during the Great Moderation period perfectly reasonable. I find the fact that a number
of different survey and financial measures of inflation expectations and of volatility, not just one set of market
prices, indicate that this update to greater volatility has not been accompanied by a rise in long-term inflation
expectations very reassuring. It would seem that markets correctly perceive a rise in economic uncertainty
while also correctly maintaining their perception of the MPC’s solid commitment to the inflation target. It
seems to me, therefore, that it is reasonable to base our inflation forecasts and thus our policymaking on the
assumption that long-run inflation expectations in the UK remain well-anchored.

The Influence of Inflation Expectations on UK Wages is Over-rated –
I began my study of the British economy in a course on modern UK economic history in 1983, and went on to
write my undergraduate senior thesis on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s policies.12 As the people in this
audience need no reminding, in the mid-1980s, the memory of the Winter of Discontent of 1978-79, of the
National Union of Mineworkers’ strike of 1984-85, and for economists of the wage-price spiral feeding British
inflation were very raw and real. It is indisputable that the bargaining power of British workers, and of
workers in the West more generally, has declined significantly since that time.13 This is partly a matter of
labor market liberalization, started in many ways with Thatcher’s facing down the NUM, and partly a matter of
increased competition from the expanded global labor force following the integration of Emerging Asia and
formerly Communist Eastern Europe into world markets. Whatever the reasons for this development, which
lie way outside of my area of expertise, there is legitimate reason to question how much British workers’
short-term inflation expectations influence wage settlements today.
Table 2 presents a set of simple regressions relating British wage growth to long-run inflation expectations
(proxied by 10 year inflation break-evens from index linked bonds), productivity growth, cyclical
unemployment (based on an OECD estimate of the NAIRU) and to previous deviation of real product wages
from productivity, and then adding various measures of consumer (and thus presumably worker) short-term
inflation expectations. In essence, this is a wage Phillips curve. The baseline model is estimated over
1985:Q1 to latest available data, 104 quarterly observations. This very simple model of wages fits the data
quite well, with an adjusted R2 of 0.72, as can be seen when plotted in Figure 12. There is no statistically
significant structural break in the model using standard diagnostics.

12

No, it is not published, and I do not recommend that anyone go to the Harvard archives and read it.
Blanchard and Gali (2007) and Posen and Popov-Gould (2007) offer some cross-national evidence that real wage
shocks in excess of productivity, and their transmission to inflation, have diminished over the last 30 years for the major
Western economies (including the UK).

The message is simple. Long-run inflation expectations, the unemployment gap, and deviations of wages
from productivity are all significant determinants of British wages – the latter in an error correcting way,
meaning when past wages are out of line with productivity, the adjustment goes in the other direction. No
measure of workers’ short-term inflation expectations, whether from surveys or proxied by averages of recent
past inflation, nor changes in those expectations (say as seen in the last year) shows up as a significant
factor for wage growth (see specifications (2) – (7) in Table 2). Thus, consistent with what we would think
institutionally and with the cross-national evidence, British wages do not exhibit much ‘real wage resistance,’
meaning much push back for higher wages when past inflation or when inflation expectations are higher.
Meanwhile, on this estimate, cyclical unemployment pushes down on wage growth, and wages are
restrained to be in line with productivity growth. All this suggests that British wage growth should be rather
modest over the next couple of years, and the forecast projection in Figure 12 is for roughly 2% nominal
wage growth annually over the inflation forecast horizon.
Some might object to such a simple model, even though it fits the facts well and the explanatory variables
have plausibly signed and sized effects, because it explains a nominal variable (wage growth) primarily
though real variables (like unemployment and productivity). This objection strikes me as misguided, even
beyond and above my strong personal preference for simple empiricism. If we live in a world of relatively
liberalized labor markets, with flexible nominal wages and workforces – and certainly the response of UK
hours and wages in 2008-2010 to the crisis is consistent with such a world – then one would expect real
forces to dominate in wage setting. Also, these equations are anchored by the stable long-term inflation
expectations that are since 1997 the constant nominal trend set by the Bank of England’s inflation target.
Interestingly, the recent survey by the Bank’s Agents of private-sector employers, the results of which are
published in the latest IR (reproduced in Figure 13 here), is consistent with the forecast of this model for
wage growth. The survey asks respondents: ‘How does your likely average pay settlement in the next pay
round compare with your average settlement last year?’. A little higher (lower) is defined as 0.1% to 1%
higher (lower) than in 2010. Significantly higher (lower) is defined as more than 1% higher (lower).
Responses are weighted by respondents’ number of employees. These results are based on 360 company
responses (covering nearly 900,000 employees) gathered during December 2010 and January 2011. 83%
of responding employers (weighted by number of employees) say that the wage increase in 2011 for their
workers will be less than 1% above 2010, 62% say that it will be the same or lower than the 2010 increase.
In 2010, the average wage increase was 1.7%.
Furthermore, it seems rather dubious to me to suggest that British workers’ concerns over near-term inflation
would not only motivate them to action, but somehow translate that action into effective bargaining power
with their employers, when all the other forces that have pushed down on labor share in the economy and on
wage growth (let alone worker power) over the last 30 years have not resulted in such effective resistance.
In particular, unemployment remains high, and some significant number of public sector workers and
employees at public sector contractors will be made redundant over the next two years as part of fiscal

consolidation efforts. I am not advocating anything here with regard to labor laws or wages, let alone fiscal
policy. I am making the empirical case for why concerns about inflation expectations translating into wages
is to me overblown, and as a result I would forecast no wage-price spiral and no sustained inflation in the UK
for the next few of years, despite inflation likely to be above target for most of 2011. This low wage and
inflation pressure is especially likely if unit labor costs are growing below their long-term average (and thus
below the rate of productivity growth), as Figure 14 indicates they are doing – if, in line with my simple model
of wage setting, the extreme divergence between wages and productivity during the crisis (seen in the spike
in ULC growth rates in 2008-09) puts further restraint on coming wage settlements.

Confidence in the Inflation Forecast and in Expectations Consistent with It –
As my previous speeches since joining the MPC I hope have made clear, I am not a triumphalist for the
power of central banks’ commitments to affect outcomes, and I certainly take my share of the responsibility
for the MPC’s error in forecasting inflation due to the past fall in Sterling. So my offering tonight empirical
evidence of the anchoring of long-term UK inflation expectations across a wide variety of measures, financial
and survey based, of the realistic adjustment upwards of inflation uncertainty without increased uncertainty
about the commitment to the inflation target, and of the limited likelihood of past inflation being transmitted
into wage settlements, is an attempt to get the inflation forecast right by looking at data and underlying
forces. I am not taking for granted that just because I know that all the members of the MPC are committed
to meeting the inflation target, everyone will believe that is the case. It is one of the virtues of the inflation
targeting regime, especially as constituted at the Bank of England, that we have to document transparently in
detail our forecasts and economic assessments, and how they match up with the outcomes. It is our ability
to convincingly explain why inflation deviations from target occur, and our inability to hide the results, that is
the basis of our credibility.14 And by all indications, long-term inflation expectations do remain anchored in
the UK. Starting there, I am lead to my forecast for (the bulk of the probability mass of expected) inflation to
be below the inflation target at the policy relevant horizon of two- to three-years hence.15
Two concerns might be raised at this point to challenge my assessment of inflation expectations, my
resulting forecast and the policy implications from it. The first would be the challenge that inflation
expectations are actually a latent variable – they exist and affect economic decisions, but the various
measures I examine here are just proxies for the underlying directly unobservable inflation expectation. I
supposed this could be true, but I am untroubled by this concern. We have to deal with latent variables in
monetary policymaking quite often, starting with the output gap itself, and while we can never be sure we
have it right, we have methods to try to approximate developments in such latent variables. We can do top
down statistical approaches of trends that meet certain criteria, we can do factor analyses where we take
many different related observable proxies and try to get at the underlying common component, and we can
14

This is the interpretation of inflation targeting my co-authors and I offered in Bernanke, et al (1999) and Laubach and
Posen (1997), and I remain convinced of its validity.
15
For the reasons discussed here regarding wages, and regarding consumption in Posen (2010e). See also Posen
(2010a,c) for discussions of what I think are the economic forces at work in the UK today.

build bottom up measures of what is sensible based on theory. That is essentially what I have done in
summary form here tonight, and more broadly the Bank of England does in monitoring and analyzing all of
these inflation expectation measures. It seems to me a stretch beyond reasonability that there could be an
underlying ‘true’ inflation expectation variable that would be rising at present but not showing up in any of the
indicators we have looked at - especially given the core inflation outcome, which combined with the inflation
target that can explain them remaining stable.
A second challenge could be that markets are subject to sudden swings in sentiment, not necessarily
unjustifiably, and the current readings on inflation expectations should not give us any reassurance.
Advocates of this view would argue that it is so important to keep inflation expectations anchored that we
must act now to prevent this risk from crystalizing. I have a number of problems with this view as a guide to
policy. The events of 2007-09 do demonstrate once again that markets can shift suddenly. Yet, that to me
just says that preparing against their shift is a matter of transparency and monitoring, not of pre-emption. In
terms of transparency, if we are already on a fundamentally sound path, in this case have a monetary policy
consistent with inflation being at (or in my opinion below) target over the medium-term, and have explained it,
why would pursuing an incorrect policy inconsistent with the target make us more credible? As the game
theory literature on ‘cheap talk’ as applied to monetary policy tells us, there is no costless way to
demonstrate toughness. Central banks have to actually move policy sufficient to move the economy to prove
one’s preferences are different from those consistent with prevailing conditions.16 Under present conditions
in the UK, such a policy tightening would in my opinion lead rapidly to inflation outcomes that would require a
reversal of that policy towards greater ease.
This kind of mistaken pre-emptive move was undertaken by the Bank of Japan to tighten policy in 2000,
despite the absence of any indicators showing inflation expectations had risen. It came instead from an
excessive desire to ‘normalize interest rates from historically loose conditions’ (roughly translated), an
outlandish fear of asset price bubbles emerging following a financial crisis, and a disregard for cyclical
economic conditions. This decision led to bad macroeconomic outcomes, a rapid reversal of policy back to
ease, and a significant blow in my opinion to those policymakers’ then in charge credibility that further deanchored inflation expectations toward inflation. (Posen (2010a)) Similar mistakes were made by the
Federal Reserve and European central banks in the early 1930s. I am not forecasting that a tightening of
policy now by the MPC would lead to deflation in UK, though I would not rule that out – I am arguing that it
would be a similar mistake for the MPC to try to prove its counter-inflationary toughness just for the sake of
chatter about rising inflation expectations that is not there in the data nor likely to influence the actual
inflation outcome for the reasons I have covered. We must make policy based on the best available
forecast, learning from our past mistakes, and not be tyrannized by popular fears or spectres of expectations.

16

In this sense, I strongly agree with the remarks of Governor King (in Bank of England (2011b)) regarding the
pointlessness of ‘futile gestures’ with monetary policy at this juncture.

The survey asks respondents: ‘How does your likely average pay settlement in the next pay round compare
with your average settlement last year?’. A little higher (lower) is defined as 0.1% to 1% higher (lower) than
in 2010. Significantly higher (lower) is defined as more than 1% higher (lower). Responses are weighted by
respondents’ number of employees. Based on 360 company responses (covering nearly 900,000
employees) to a survey of companies by the Bank’s Agents carried out during December 2010 and January
2011.
Note: The average pay settlement in 2010 was 1.7% for the economy as a whole.

(a) The questions ask about expected changes in prices, but do not reference a specific price index. All
measures are based on the median estimated price change.
(b) The number in brackets shows the window in years over which respondents are asked to report their
expectations.
(c) The questions specifically refer to CPI inflation. Based on the mean estimated price change.
