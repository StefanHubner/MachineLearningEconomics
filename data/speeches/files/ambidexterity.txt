For most of the post-war period, central banks have executed macro-economic policy with, at most,
one hand – the monetary policy hand. It is generally felt that their dexterity improved steadily over that
period. This culminated in a long period of low and stable rates of inflation and a steadily growing economy
between the mid-1990s and 2007 – the “Great Moderation” [Goodfriend, 2007]. Central banks had
becalmed both inflation and the business cycle – and had done so single-handedly. Or so it appeared.

But even while the economies of major advanced countries were an ocean of pre-crisis calm, a storm was
brewing out in the credit market seas. When this storm hit in 2008, it caused a contraction in global output
only rivalled by the Great Depression. Great Moderation turned abruptly to Great Recession. In response,
questions began to be asked about whether monetary policy, while necessary, was sufficient to stabilise
simultaneously the macro-economy and the financial system [Bank of England, 2009].

Unlike the Great Depression, central banks’ response to the Great Recession was swift and sizable. Central
bank interest rates in most advanced economies quickly fell to close to their floor, while central bank balance
sheets rose to new heights. Relative to money spending, central bank money supply is at its highest levels
in the 15-year history of the European Central Bank, the 100-year history of the US Federal Reserve, the
131-year history of the Bank of Japan and the 319-year history of the Bank of England.

Accompanying these monetary policy changes has been a marked shift in regulatory philosophy. Since the
crisis, financial regulation has become explicitly macro-prudential [Morris and Shin, 2008; Bank of England,
2011; Hanson et al, 2011]. This is an expression much-used, but generally little-understood. In a nutshell, it
means that policymakers have begun using prudential means to meet macro-economic ends.

Those macro-economic ends include tempering swings in credit and leverage – the classic credit cycle. The
credit cycle is a long-established feature of the financial landscape [Aikman et al, 2014]. Chart 1 shows its
pattern in the UK over the past 130 years or so. The credit cycle is every bit as regular as the business
cycle. But it differs from the business cycle in two critical respects: its amplitude is at least twice as large
and its duration at least twice as long. Both are important for the design of macro-prudential policy regimes.

The larger amplitude of the credit cycle is one reason why credit booms have, more often than not
historically, resulted in banking crises (Table 1). Because financial crises cause large and long-lived
disruption to the economy, this suggests a strong empirical link between credit cycles and macroeconomic
destabilisation. Or, put differently, curbing the credit cycle appears to be an important ingredient of
broadly-based macro-economic stability.

In principle, monetary policy could be used to curb the credit cycle. In practice, the differing duration and
synchronicity of the credit and business cycles means this is unlikely to work well. Pre-crisis experience
illustrates well just that point. At the same time as the wider economy was operating in cruise control, credit

markets were in overdrive. Hitting these two birds – one flying high, the other low - with one (monetary
policy) stone would have defied even the most astute marksman [King, 2013].

What is needed, in these instances, is a second instrument. In the language of Tinbergen [Tinbergen, 1952],
two cycles and two objectives call for two instruments. This is where macro-prudential policy comes in. One
of the aims of macro-prudential policy is to act counter-cyclically on the credit cycle, constraining credit
booms and cushioning busts [Aikman et al, 2014]. In this role, macro-prudential policy is complementing
monetary policy in its role of stabilising the macro-economy. Macro-economic policy then becomes, in effect,
two-handed or ambidextrous.

Since the crisis, this two-handed approach to policy has been taken up actively by a number of countries
internationally [IMF, 2013]. For example, counter-cyclical prudential policy is now baked into new
international regulatory rules. The so-called Basel III reforms introduced for the first time a “Counter-cyclical
Capital Buffer” (CCB) to be adjusted to counteract the credit cycle [BCBS, 2010]. While a small step for
mankind, this is a giant one for bank regulators.

It is also, inevitably, something of a step into the unknown. What will be the impact of changes to the CCB
on credit and growth? Will the two arms of policy (monetary and macro-prudential) be better than one? And,
if so, what institutional arrangements best deliver those benefits? Policy experience from the recent past and
the present can shed light on these questions.

The US Dotcom Bubble

As a first case study, consider the behaviour of the US economy after the bursting of the dotcom bubble in
2001. Chart 2 plots US official interest rates in the period just before and after this event. Interest rates fell
sharply, from 6.5% at the beginning of 2001 to 1% by the middle of 2003, to cushion the effects of the
financial headwinds created by the dotcom bubble popping.

Consider now what interest rate path would have been predicted had policy been responding mechanically
to deviations of inflation from target and output from potential – in other words, following a standard
“Taylor rule” [Taylor, 1993]. As Chart 2 shows, this would have implied a less dramatic fall in interest rates in
the US. After the dotcom crash, a gap opened up between actual and Taylor-rule implied US interest rates.
This was both sizable (on average, one or two percentage points) and persistent (lasting from early 2001
right up until summer 2008). Over that period, the Taylor rule suggested US monetary policy was looser
than could be explained by inflation and output alone.

Whether by coincidence or causality, what happened next in US credit markets was dramatic. Chart 3 plots
the ratio of US credit-to-GDP, relative to its long run trend, over the same period – the “credit gap”. This
indicator has a special significance from a regulatory perspective because it will act as a guideline path for

the setting of the CCB once Basel III comes into effect. The US credit gap rose steadily from around 2001
up until 2008. Relative to its long-run trend, credit-to-GDP reached a peak of over 10 percentage points. By
historical standards, this is a huge credit boom.

We can now ask ourselves the counter-factual question, how different might the world have looked had
macro-prudential policy been available to assist monetary policy? Answering this question rigorously would
require that we re-run the paths of policy, the economy and the financial system over this period – a full
counter-factual simulation. That is beyond the scope of this paper.

As a shorthand, we can still do something simple but nevertheless informative about the way the world might
have looked. This is done by simply redrawing the path of US banks’ capital ratios on the assumption that
the CCB had been in place. In particular, we can use the Basel III calibration of the link between the CCB
and the credit gap to simulate a hypothetical path for US banks’ capital ratios. Such an exercise is
essentially identical to the common practice of constructing Taylor rules for monetary policy, as in Chart 2.

Chart 4 draws the macro-prudential policy-implied path of US bank capital ratios. In deference to the
architect of modern theories of credit-induced instability, let us call this the “Minsky rule” [Minsky, 1986]. The
path of the Minsky rule is, in many respects, the mirror-image of the Taylor rule. It suggests that hypothetical
US banks’ capital ratios would have been systemically and significantly tighter than their actual path between
2000 and 2009. In other words, a tight macro-prudential stance would have counteracted the effects of a
loose monetary policy stance.

Although it is impossible to know for certain, it seems plausible that having this extra degree of policy
freedom would have helped stabilise the US economy and financial system. A tighter bank capital regime
would have tended to slow pre-crisis credit growth, thus constraining the boom. And more capital in the US
banking system would have helped protect the wider economy from the credit crunch that followed the bust.
In short, the boom-bust cycles in US credit and GDP would have plausibly been somewhat less severe had
US policy been ambidextrous.

The Euro-zone crisis

As a second historical example, consider the behaviour of some euro-zone crisis countries. In the run-up to
monetary union, monetary policy was loosened significantly in a number of the peripheral European
countries whose interest rates converged on core euro-area countries. As Chart 5 illustrates, between 1995
and 1999 interest rates fell by between 3 and 6 percentage points in Ireland, Spain and Portugal. And in
Greece between 1995 and 2001, interest rates fell by a remarkable 16 percentage points.

Whether by coincidence or causality, what happened next in credit markets in these countries was dramatic.
The credit gaps in each of Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece widened significantly and continued widening

through the early part of this century (Chart 6). By 2008, these credit gaps stood at over 25 percentage
points in Greece and Portugal, almost 40 percentage points in Spain and over 50 percentage points in
Ireland. It is unlikely that any of these countries have previously seen credit booms on this scale.

It is useful again to rerun history and ask how macro-prudential policy might have looked over this period.
Charts 7 and 8 give the “Minsky rule” paths for bank capital ratios in Spain and Ireland relative to their actual
paths. As in the US, they show macro-prudential policy-implied capital ratios lying significantly above their
actual paths, by progressively larger amounts. At their peak, Minsky rule paths for bank capital are more
than twice their actual levels in Spain and three times their actual level in Ireland. Macro-prudential
stringency would have counteracted the loosening of monetary policy.

For those peripheral European economies that experienced a credit boom, it is plausible to think a tighter
macro-prudential stance would have helped reduce the severity of the global crisis of 2008 and the
euro-area crisis of 2010. Tighter capital standards would have slowed pre-crisis credit growth, tempering the
boom. And the extra capital built up in the European banking system would have helped contain some of the
collateral damage from the resulting credit bust. In short, as in the US, the boom-bust cycles in credit and
GDP in the euro-area would plausibly have been much less severe had policy been ambidextrous.

The Current Conjuncture

The third example is from the present. In response to the crisis, short-term interest rates in major advanced
economies fell rapidly to their floor and have remained there (Chart 9). Aided and abetted by programmes of
quantitative easing, real long-term rates have followed suit, falling to historically unprecedentedly low levels
(Chart 10). These responses from monetary policy were a natural reaction to the opening-up of sizable
output gaps in many advanced economies. Extraordinary times called for extraordinary measures.

Whether by coincide or causality, what has happened since in financial markets has been striking. The
risk-taking cycle in some advanced economies has decisively turned. For example, issuance in the US
high-yield market reached a record high in 2013, with half coming in a “covenant-lite” form (Chart 11). This is
evidence of a renewed “hunt for yield” among investors [Stein, 2013].

We do not need to run a counter-factual experiment to determine the macro-prudential responses to these
emerging pressures. A number of countries have already taken preventative macro-prudential action to
forestall excessive risk-taking (Table 2). These measures are intended to forestall too rapid an accumulation
of credit. In short, macro-prudential stringency is seeking to counteract any adverse risk-taking
consequences of loose monetary policy.

In the UK, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been pursuing a policy of
extra-ordinary monetary accommodation. Recently, there have been signs of renewed risk-taking in some

asset markets, including the housing market. The MPC’s macro-prudential sister committee, the
Financial Policy Committee (FPC), has been tasked with countering these risks. Through this dual
committee structure, the joint needs of the economy and financial system are hopefully being satisfied.

Some have suggested that having monetary and macro-prudential policy act in opposite directions – one
loose, the other tight – somehow puts the two in conflict [De Paoli and Paustian, 2013]. That is odd. The
right mix of monetary and macro-prudential measures depends on the state of the economy and the financial
system. In the current environment in many advanced economies – sluggish growth but advancing
risk-taking - it seems like precisely the right mix. And, of course, it is a mix that is only possible if policy is
ambidextrous.

To underscore this point, Chart 12 plots a scatter of counter-factual Taylor and Minsky rules in the UK over
the period 1964 to 2011. Points in the upper right and lower left quadrants signal monetary and
macro-prudential policy operating in the same direction; points in the upper left and lower right, these
policies operating in opposite directions. The points are fairly evenly scattered across all four quadrants.
This tells us that the right macro-prudential/monetary policy mix depends critically on the relative needs of
the economy and the financial system. But two arms beat one, hands-down.

Institutional Arrangements and Macro-Prudential Policy

Finally, if macro-prudential policy is a useful addition to the policy toolkit, who should have control over it?
Here, a comparison with monetary policy experience is illustrative.

Macro-prudential policy faces many of the same dilemmas as monetary policy. The most serious of these is
the time-consistency dilemma [Kydland and Prescott, 1979; Chari and Kehoe, 2013]. In the monetary policy
sphere, this manifests as a desire to loosen policy today to support the economy when tightening to control
inflation tomorrow would be more appropriate. In the macro-prudential sphere, it manifests as a desire to
loosen regulation to support today’s growth when tightening to counter tomorrow’s crisis would be more
appropriate. In both cases, policy faces an inter-temporal trade-off in its objectives – a myopia trap.

The time-consistency dilemma is likely, if anything, to be even more acute when fighting crises than when
fighting inflation [Haldane, 2013]. The reason is that credit cycles last at least twice as long as business
cycles. The myopia trap for macro-prudential policy is even more painful than for monetary policy. That is
why “This Time is Different” has so often in the past been the pre-crisis refrain [Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008].

In the monetary policy sphere, an institutional solution has been applied to this myopia problem. Specifically,
in most countries these days monetary policy decision-making has been delegated to a long-sighted,
arms-length agency – typically, an independent central bank. This is now accepted best practice globally
[Goodfriend, 2007]. Because it faces a time-consistency dilemma every bit as acute, the self-same logic

applies to macro-prudential policy. In other words, one safeguard against financial crisis myopia comes from
placing the levers of macro-prudential policy in the hands of an arms-length, independent central bank
[Haldane, 2013].

There is a second reason for doing so. Experience from the past and the present suggests that using the
monetary and macro-prudential arms in tandem may have helped stabilise simultaneously the financial
sector and wider economy. That calls for monetary/macro-prudential co-ordination. Such co-ordination is
more likely to be happen if these two arms are attached to a single body and head. Monetary and
macro-prudential policy then represent two halves of the same central bank brain.

In practice, these arguments have not, so far at least, entirely won the day internationally. A significant
number of new macro-prudential frameworks have emerged internationally in the past few years. In some
cases, including in the UK, central banks have been handed macro-prudential responsibilities. This has
enabled explicit co-ordination between the monetary and macro-prudential arms when tackling the joint
needs of the economy and financial system – for example, in the UK through joint meetings of the Bank’s
MPC and FPC.

But in a number of other countries, responsibility for macro-prudential policy has been located outside of
central banks [IMF, 2013]. We have a mixed model. In this institutional respect, macro-prudential policy
today resembles monetary policy perhaps a generation ago.

It is, of course, still early days for

macroprudential regimes. Monetary policy took a generation, if not two, of trial and error to find its feet. For
policymakers finding their feet today, doing so will be far easier using two arms than one.
