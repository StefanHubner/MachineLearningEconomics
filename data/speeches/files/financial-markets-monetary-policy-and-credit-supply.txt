Thank you for having me back at Richmond University. In this lecture today, I aim to review the behaviour
and development of financial markets over the past year, including the period of heightened volatility since
May and the introduction by the Monetary Policy Committee of explicit forward-looking monetary policy
guidance in August. I will also assess the working and impact of the Funding for Lending Scheme over its
first year of operation.

Developments in financial markets

When I spoke to you a year ago, financial markets were still scarred by the crisis years and there remained a
number of significant downside tail risks to the global economy. Contacts were citing: the risks of a breakup
of the euro-area; the possibility of a ‘fiscal cliff’ in the US; a slowing in China, alongside already weak growth
in the advanced economies; and tensions in the Middle East – especially around the Straits of Hormuz. But
those tail risks were seen to be offset in large part by the commitment of central banks to respond. The ECB
had announced its Outright Monetary Transactions programme and had been interpreted as publicly
committing to do whatever it takes to keep the euro-area together. The FOMC similarly committed to keep
the US economy growing, with state-contingent forward guidance being issued in December 2012. The
MPC had voted to increase its stock of asset purchases to £375 billion in July 2012 and introduced the
Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS). Taken together these factors were generating a growing ‘hunt for yield’,
initially cautious and focussed on relatively simple, liquid financial instruments but gradually expanding,
especially in terms of credit risk – for example ‘high yield’ bonds were in particularly high demand, leading to
historically compressed spreads.

Since then, we have seen a game of two halves. If I move on to around April this year, the picture had
changed substantively relative to the autumn. The previously perceived tail risks were fading from
discussions. Europe was making progress on a number of structural reforms, including moving towards a
banking union. A mini-crisis in Cyprus had been dealt with, without too many spillovers. Spreads over
bunds for sovereign debt of the larger vulnerable euro-area economies had narrowed considerably. The US
‘fiscal cliff’ at end-2012 had passed by with some relief (although concerns about the processes associated
with the US fiscal deficit have now resurfaced). While fiscal consolidation might have slowed US growth
somewhat, the process of adjustment around the turn of the year had been smoother than feared and the
macroeconomic repercussions rather less. China had injected some renewed stimulus and Japan had
introduced a far reaching new economic framework of quantitative and qualitative easing to improve the
outlook there. At that time, Middle East tensions had not induced further Western military intervention and
the oil price had been relatively stable, falling to around the $100pb mark. One could argue that central
banks – and other authorities – had validated expectations.

Chart 2 shows a ‘heat map’ constructed by colleagues in the Bank’s Financial Stability Directorate, showing
how market functioning has changed over time based on issuance levels and spreads. It tracks how most
markets have continued to improve towards normal levels (on these indicators at least). An interesting
exception is markets for bank funding instruments in Europe, which have became subdued as commercial
banks have de-levered and central bank operations have provided cheap medium-term funding in large
scale. Perhaps the worst functioning is the market for CMBS which has still not really returned in the UK (in
contrast to CLOs which have made a comeback this year).

Given such benign conditions it seemed natural to ask whether firms were prepared for the risk of a sudden
change in conditions – in particular the possibility of a snap back in interest rates at some point. In early
April, such questions to contacts usually evoked a blank response! Those who had been betting on rates
rising had consistently lost money and such positions generally had been cut. There were few visible signs
of any increase in hedging activity other than reports that some investors preferred floating rate rather than
fixed rate products at the margin. A lot of faith seemed to be enshrined in the ability to anticipate the FOMC:
that it would signal clearly and early what its strategy would be, leading to a smooth exit from its policy
stance. Altogether the market was ripe for some volatility consequent to a change in the policy outlook. That
volatility duly arrived.

The initial catalyst was the strong US non-farm payrolls data on May 3rd after which longer term yields
started to rise. But there was not a wider market reaction at that point. It was Bernanke’s comments on
May 22nd that the FOMC could begin tapering its asset purchases “in the next few meetings” which caused a
widespread reassessment of risk positions. What followed was a good illustration of what can happen when
there is a general sell-off. Initially asset price correlation increased and liquidity became poor across
markets. Because the news related to a prospective policy tightening, risk-free yields generally rose
(Chart 3), although at least some of this was a change in term premia rather than rate expectations. Equity
markets fell. Some contacts described conditions as highly volatile. EME assets in particular were badly
affected as leveraged investors cut their risk positions quickly in those markets (Chart 4). Eventually, as
conditions settled, there was more discrimination between and within asset classes. For example, there has
been much more distinction between those EMEs whose fundamentals were seen to be relatively sound and
those who were seen to have challenges – in this latter group were especially those with both a large
external deficit and high inflation.

Although the sell-off has been wide ranging and left several EMEs with difficult policy challenges, I don’t
sense any long-lived market dysfunction. Market infrastructures worked and prices adjusted to the revised
policy outlook. Yes, volatility rose, but not to levels which are particularly unusual for such episodes
(Chart 1). The most highly leveraged positions – such as in mortgage REITs1 – were reported to have
liquidated quickly, and some ETF2s, primarily fixed-income, came under liquidity pressure. Those institutions
with short trading horizons and leveraged positions may have found conditions very difficult at times to adjust
portfolios. Although it is clear that a number of firms must have made substantial losses on the positions
they had, there have not been many visible signs of severe financial distress. For most longer-term investors
the stress has been seen as rather limited. Credit spreads have not particularly blown out with rising
‘risk-free’ rates. For example, yields on Italian and Spanish bonds were remarkably stable for most of this
period; advanced economy equity prices largely recovered; and ‘cov-lite’ loans have continued to be issued
at a record pace. Overall the system seems to have survived in reasonable shape and for many market
participants the ‘shock’ is seen as a healthy correction to what had become a complacent outlook.

As reported in the record of the recent FPC meeting published yesterday, staff from the FCA, PRA and Bank
have carried out some analysis of the sensitivity of borrowers and financial institutions to upward movements
in long-term interest rates and credit spreads.3 That preliminary work suggested that ‘a moderate rise in
long-term interest rates did not pose an immediate threat to major banks and insurance companies. But
borrowers would become more exposed to an increase in interest rates were debt levels to rise. And
counterparty classes with higher leverage or exposures to market liquidity risk or credit spreads were more
affected...’. The Committee did not draw too much comfort from this assessment and has asked that more
detailed work be done to assess the risks.

What have we learned from this episode? I will pick out a few of the highlights for discussion. First let me
note that the ‘stress’ so far has not involved any actual exit from accommodative policies in the advanced
economies. The change in the outlook was initiated by speculation about the possibility that the FOMC
might start to slightly reduce the rate at which it is adding stimulus! It would have been a more severe stress
if policy rates had actually been changed. Many firms for whom maturity transformation is a major part of
their business model will actually be better off if the short-term rates at which they fund themselves are
relatively unchanged while longer-term rates rise.

Have markets got it wrong? If so then in my view that was not obviously in the price reactions since May
(although the extent of the fixed-income sell-off may turn out to have been over-done, especially for the UK) rather it was the expectations that had become embedded prior to May which had become overly certain
even if, at that time, it supported the intent of monetary policy in both the US and Europe.

It is important to remember that monetary policy is about decision making under uncertainty. Considerable
uncertainty. Policy makers get surprised by economic developments just like everyone else, and that news
is often visible to the market before the authorities can even think about the right responses, let alone
respond to them. If I, as a policy maker, am uncertain about how policy will evolve, how can the market be
so much more certain? I am continually struck by the degree of certainty some market participants seem to
have about prospective monetary policy decisions, particularly those of the FOMC. In general,
communication from monetary policy setters aims to convey details of our reaction functions – how policy
might change in reaction to future data or other news – it is not aimed to convey the outcome of a decision
that has yet to be made! The best we can usually do is to set out how we are thinking about the outlook so
that market participants and others might be able dynamically to gauge our response as the data and events
reveal themselves. Forward guidance, on which more shortly, can add to that understanding but the actual
outcome for policy will always be dependent on how the economy, and hence the outlook, evolves.

Can we learn anything about the impact of large scale asset purchases – or quantitative easing – from this
recent episode? More work will have to be done on this as a case study but, at face value, the fact that US
Treasury yields could move by over 100bps just on speculation of a small reduction in the rate of purchases,
confirms that asset purchases in the US must have been having a very sizable effect on market prices, at
least as large as the quantitative estimates that have previously been made.4 And the degree of reaction in
UK gilt yields makes it clear that there have been large international spillovers - a point which some previous
research has also noted5. The degree of correlation since May has been striking and for shorter-term rates,
it is possible that it has been exacerbated by poor liquidity in money markets and hence over-done. Given
how the recoveries have differed in scale and nature – the US economy has grown much more than the UK
since the recession, and has not suffered the same collapse in productivity - one would surely expect the
prospects for monetary policy to be quite different in the two jurisdictions.

A final issue I want to raise is whether market behaviour has been affected by regulatory changes. Over the
past year or so many of the reforms being introduced internationally have been implemented or anticipated.
In particular the future rules on capital and liquidity have become clearer, and proprietary trading has largely
relocated away from the traditional intermediaries as a result of the ‘Volcker Rule’. The past five months has
been the first stressful period since those changes. Many market contacts have suggested that liquidity
during the recent sell-off has been worse than it would have been because the dealers are no longer willing
or able to absorb volatility by taking client positions onto their balance sheet. They argue that the dealers’
ability and willingness to make markets has been much reduced. This is a subject of ongoing consideration
in the official community. But we have to bear in mind that in a rapidly moving market, regardless of the
regulations, no one has ever really wanted to ‘catch the falling knife’. And investors have always needed to
4

For example, Gagnon, Raskin, Remache and Sack (2010) estimated that the Fed’s first round of Large Scale Asset Purchases
reduced 10-year term premium by somewhere between 30 and 100 basis points, with most estimates in the lower and middle thirds of
this range.
5
For instance, Neely (2010) finds evidence of significant spillovers from the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs to other advanced economy
sovereign bond markets, with yields falling on average by around half the associated fall in US 10-year yields, while Moore, Nam, Suh
and Tepper (2013) find that emerging economy government bond yields fell by around a sixth.

be aware that crowded trades will hit a bottleneck if everyone tries to exit at the same time. On EME assets
for example, liquidity during a ‘risk off’ period has always been limited. In my view, we can’t draw any hard
conclusions on this topic yet and more evidence is needed.
Forward guidance
It was in an environment of increased volatility that the MPC decided at its August policy meeting to provide
some explicit guidance regarding the future path of our monetary policy instruments. Since our
announcement it has been suggested that this policy is overly complicated. I disagree. The policy was
summarised in a single sentence in our explanatory document6:
‘In essence, the MPC judges that, until the margin of slack within the economy has narrowed significantly, it
will be appropriate to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy, provided that
such an approach remains consistent with its primary objective of price stability and does not endanger
financial stability’.
In case that’s not sufficiently simple, let me put it the other way round: we remain committed to returning CPI
inflation to its 2% target in line with our remit but, in doing so, we will not act in a way which would risk
choking off the recovery prematurely, given the potential for a substantial amount of spare capacity in the
economy.

The technical details of the policy are needed to make this precise so that it can be implemented and
monitored: the MPC intends not to raise Bank Rate from its current level of 0.5% at least until the Labour
Force Survey headline measure of the unemployment rate has fallen to a threshold of 7%. The MPC stands
ready to undertake further asset purchases while the unemployment rate remains above 7% if it judges that
additional monetary stimulus is warranted but will otherwise maintain the stock of asset purchases and will
reinvest the cash flows associated with all maturing gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility.

This guidance linking Bank Rate and asset sales to the unemployment threshold would cease to hold if any
of the following three ‘knockouts’ were breached:


if, in the MPC’s view, it is more likely than not, that CPI inflation 18 to 24 months ahead will be 0.5
percentage points or more above the 2% target;



if medium-term inflation expectations no longer remain sufficiently well anchored;



if the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant
threat to financial stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of mitigating policy
actions available to the FPC, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority
in a way consistent with their objectives.

Explicit forward policy guidance can enhance the effectiveness of monetary stimulus in three ways. First, it
provides greater clarity regarding the MPC’s view of the appropriate trade-off between the speed with which
inflation is returned to the target and the support given to the recovery. Second, it can reduce uncertainty
about the future path of monetary policy as the economy recovers. And third, it delivers a robust framework
within which the MPC can explore the scope for economic expansion without putting price stability and
financial stability at risk.

This latter point is especially important to grasp in order to understand the intent of the policy. Since 2008,
aggregate productivity in the UK – measured as output per hour worked - has behaved unlike any previous
recession/recovery. The level of productivity in the economy as a whole today is around 15% below where it
would have been on an unchanged long-term trend. We don’t know how much of this productivity gap can
be reclaimed. But if even only a small part could be recovered then output should be able to grow strongly
for some years without generating much inflationary pressure. In particular, firms should collectively be
carrying enough spare labour to expand output without putting pressure on the labour market.
Unemployment would consequently fall slowly relative to normal experience, for a given rate of output
growth.

It is important to stress that forward guidance is not a guarantee to hold rates where they are for a set period
of time, as has been widely mis-reported. The guidance is given in the form it is precisely because the
outlook is uncertain – it allows us to explore how much spare capacity there really is in the economy before
raising Bank Rate.

Much has been made of the market reaction to forward guidance since its launch, with market prices
currently implying that Bank Rate will rise by 25 basis points by the middle of 2015, around six months earlier
than at the time of our August meeting. I think there are a range of reasons for that and it does not
necessarily imply that forward guidance “isn’t working”. First, gauging the ‘market reaction’ depends who
you ask. Surveys of economists by Thompson Reuters and by Bloomberg have indicated that the median
expected timing of the first increase in Bank Rate has been pushed later since our announcement (Chart 5).
Second, there has been UK specific news which might have justifiably caused UK rates to have risen
somewhat: the positive flow of economic data since the start of August has been consistently stronger than
market expectations. Third, UK rates have clearly been pushed up by international developments. The
correlation in short rates between the UK and US is unhelpful given the relatively subdued recovery in the
UK and, as I have already noted, somewhat puzzling. It probably, in part, reflects continuing poor liquidity in
sterling money markets over this period. It may well be the case that these rates decouple in future as
liquidity improves and the outlook for each economy develops further.

expect the Bank of England to change rates next?'

Whatever the explanation for the recent rise in interest rates, we do not intend to maintain a running
commentary on whether the market has got it right or wrong in relation to when Bank Rate will rise.
Monetary policy is a medium-term game, and its success or failure cannot be judged over a matter of weeks
or by volatile price movements. If market expectations are in the wrong place then market participants will
realise that in due course and rates will adjust. In any case, in my personal view, the biggest impact from
forward guidance was never going to be from trying to shift the sterling market curve around – it is still pretty
flat for 2 years ahead. The important thing is to get the message across to businesses and households
about what the outlook for monetary policy really is. Concern that interest rates will rise as soon as growth
returns may well have been a factor already holding back the recovery.

It’s a case of so far, so good, on that front. The early reactions we are getting from individuals or groups of
business people generally suggest that they have got the message and that will be adding to confidence.
For example, the Bank’s latest public survey shows a marked reduction in the proportion of people expecting
a rise in interest rates over the next year – it’s currently the lowest reading since Bank Rate was cut sharply
in late 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. So in terms of supporting the real economy, I think the policy
is working.

Forward guidance is an important part of the broader mixed strategy the Bank is employing, using many of
its tools to secure the recovery while not taking risks with inflation or financial stability. For example, the FPC
and PRA have been working to ensure UK banks and building societies have sufficient capital to help
support and sustain the recovery. And they will remain vigilant to make sure that macroeconomic stimulus

does not translate into imprudent lending behaviour. Another strand of policy is the Funding for Lending
Scheme, which is where I would like to turn now.

The Funding for Lending Scheme: one year on

It was on the day of this lecture last year that the Bank of England announced the first 13 banks and building
societies to have signed up to the FLS. There are now over 40 firms participating, representing over 80% of
the stock of lending to the UK economy. The total amount of outstanding drawings under the Scheme is
over £17bn and rising. The MPC has been using a wide range of indicators at various stages of the
transmission mechanism to help assess the extent to which credit conditions have improved since its launch.
Let me run through those.

Stage 1: bank funding costs

Our first objective was to reduce bank funding costs – and this phase has been remarkably successful. Over
the past year, those costs have fallen sharply (Chart 6). Of course, they are likely to have been affected by
developments internationally, including Mario Draghi’s “do whatever it takes” remarks in July 2012. But
usually sterling funding markets would react by less than euro-denominated markets to European
developments. In fact, UK unsecured bond spreads fell further in the UK than in core euro-area countries –
indicative of an additional boost from the FLS over and above general market developments.

Indeed, funding conditions have improved so much (not just in prices but in terms of quantities) that it is safe
to say that bank funding is no longer a constraint on lending for most UK banks – the larger banks tell us that
they are “awash” with liquidity. If you were to go back around two years, tightening funding conditions for the
banking system was one of the big issues policy makers and banks were discussing, and it’s striking to see
how conditions have changed completely since then. Costs have come down so much that some banks
have been able to get funding in the market as cheaply, or cheaper, than we are providing in the Scheme.
This is important to understand – it means the scale of FLS draw downs is not a measure of success. In fact
the more stressed market conditions are, and the higher market funding costs rise, the more we would
expect banks to draw from the Scheme. Going forward, the FLS should help to keep funding costs down by
serving as a backstop marginal funding source if market funding costs were to rise.

Stage 2: Quoted terms and credit availability

The second stage in achieving our objective was a reduction in lending rates to the economy and an
improvement in credit availability. This has happened, albeit more slowly than initially anticipated. On
average we’ve seen rates on two-year fixed rate mortgage products come down by around 110bps since the
FLS was announced, and floating rate mortgages by a bit less (around 60bps) (Chart 6). The availability of

secondary market bond spreads and the swap rate corresponding to the
term of the mortgage. For floating-rate mortgages, three-month Libor is
used in place of a swap rate. For more details see Chart 1.8 of the August
2013 Inflation Report.

It’s harder to measure what has happened to lending rates to businesses as the borrowers and loan
products available are less homogenous than in the household sector. Lenders report that loan spreads
have fallen for companies of all sizes, and that credit availability has increased, but the improvement has
been less marked for small and medium-sized businesses. We have seen banks take different approaches
to SME loans: one bank has scrapped some of its arrangement fees, another is offering guaranteed
discounted borrowing costs and another offers a cash back scheme. So one can’t capture the impact of the
FLS on the cost of borrowing for businesses in a single simple, headline, interest rate measure. Survey
evidence from the Federation of Small Businesses suggests that the pricing of loans for small businesses
was more favourable in 2013 Q2 than in mid-2012 – but availability was reportedly poor. So it’s a mixed
picture overall for SMEs. Going forward, SME credit conditions should be supported by the extension to the
FLS announced in April, which provides additional incentives for participants to increase lending to SMEs
both this year and in 2014. A large proportion of FLS participants have indicated their intention to participate
in the extended Scheme.

It is likely that any person or business who has borrowed from a bank since the middle of last year will have
done so at a cheaper rate than they would have done in the absence of the Scheme. If so then the FLS will
have had a monetary impulse on the economy. We think that the FLS will continue to bear down on lending
rates to households and businesses in the rest of this year and beyond.

Stage 3: Loan applications and approvals

The next stage is for the reduction in rates to induce an increase in the demand for credit. A key parameter
for the response in quantities is the price elasticity of demand for credit. We have been hearing lots of
positive comments about the state of demand in the housing market since early in the year: from builders,
estate agents, lenders and contacts of our regional network of Agents, and this has recently reflected into an
improvement in the data.

Let me note that although the housing market is clearly gathering momentum, and house prices have started
to hit the headlines, I must say that don’t see any evidence of bubble behaviour as yet, with mortgage
lending still subdued relative to what is likely to be normal levels of activity. The housing market is
recovering from a number of years of very low transactions, with house prices having risen well below the
inflation rate. It is not surprising if we see an adjustment of relative prices when the market recovers and of
course London has special demand pressures which are not present elsewhere in the UK, especially for
high-end housing. But we may well see a response in new housing supply in due course, limiting the effects
of demand on house prices. Let me assure you that the Bank will not be complacent about allowing financial
stability risks to build through an over-expansion of the housing market. Both borrowers and lenders need to
be careful not to over-stretch themselves. In line with the recent FPC statement, we will be keeping a very
close eye on developments, and the Bank has a range of tools that can be used in mitigation of those risks.

Stage 4: The flow of credit

Annual growth in the stock of lending to households and businesses has remained close to zero since
mid-2012, similar to rates seen in the run-up to the launch of the FLS. But it is important to bear in mind that
prior to the announcement of the FLS, the Bank judged that UK bank lending was more likely to decline than
increase over the following eighteen months. The profile of lending seen to date has been broadly in line
with our original expectations: the trend in household net lending has been somewhat stronger than
expected before the launch of the FLS and net lending to businesses has been perhaps a little weaker.

We were also conscious that the stock of credit depends on both supply and demand. We were sure that the
FLS would shift supply but the demand effects were always less certain. The price elasticity for firms in
particular is likely to be low. It is possible at the margin that some firms will be better able to repay or
refinance loans if their borrowing costs are a bit lower, but this effect is probably small relative to the
importance of expected demand for a firm’s products. So the scale of response in the overall flow of credit to
businesses depends in part on a wider confidence effect shifting the demand curve. We may finally be
seeing that restoration of business confidence in which case the flow of credit to businesses should pick up.

Beneath that aggregate narrative, there are some revealing stories in the details. The data we publish each
quarter reveal material differences in net lending volumes across participants in the Scheme.

The main lenders are in quite different places (Chart 7). For example, 30 out of 41 participating groups have
had positive net lending since the launch of the scheme, despite the slight contraction in the aggregate
numbers. Together, these groups lent a net £25bn to the UK real economy, while the eleven groups that
contracted their net lending did so by a combined £28bn. That in part reflects a desire by several major UK
lenders to reduce the scale of their so-called ‘non-core’ loan portfolios following the financial crisis, or a need
to comply with State Aid conditions. So these banks may not see material increases in their total lending,
even if they use the FLS to the full to support their core activities.

There are other factors at play. For example, nearly half of bank and building society lending to businesses
is to the commercial property sector and a good part of the rest will be secured on property. Pre-crisis,
banks lent too much money, too cheaply, to too many borrowers, especially in this sector. Many of those
assets remain impaired and are being run off or sold off where possible, negatively impacting banks’ lending
figures. And given the losses suffered by most banks on these portfolios, there is a natural reluctance to
increase lending to that sector again. One reason we’ve not yet seen a significant expansion in total lending
is that banks have tightened their credit assessment criteria since the crisis and have not changed them
following the launch of the FLS. Some borrowers will find that frustrating. But from the banks’ point of view it
is a prudent thing to have done, so they don’t get back into the troubles they were in before.

When considering the corporate lending numbers, it is important to remember that many companies
(particularly large firms) are making increased use of capital markets to raise finance. Bond issuance by UK
businesses remained strong in 2013 Q2, following a Q1 figure which was the highest since 2009 Q2. And
the Bank’s Agents have heard reports of some smaller businesses preferring to seek out non-bank
alternatives for finance, including peer-to-peer lending, insurance companies and investment funds to

diversify their funding sources. So when assessing trends in credit supply, it is important to consider flows of
lending from all sources, not just the banks. The extension to the FLS to include lending related to non-bank
credit providers (including finance leasing corporations and factoring companies) recognises the importance
of some of these forms of lending to SMEs.

Finally, there are a number of small ‘challenger’ banks who are successfully using the FLS to help expand
and take market share from the more traditional lenders.

You sometimes see the phrase ‘the banks are not lending to SMEs’. That is simply not true when you look
into the details. The data on SME lending is not fully comprehensive nor of the best quality. But the data we
do have suggest that since the launch of the Scheme, gross lending to SMEs has been around £40bn,
although repayments have been slightly higher, so the overall picture of slightly negative net lending is the
difference between two much larger numbers. Within that aggregate picture there are many individual banks
which have expanded their net lending to SMEs whilst others have contracted. That is partly why I have
been advising business contacts to ‘shop around’ for credit if they can.

Overall, I believe the FLS has successfully shifted the supply of credit to households and businesses over
the past year, and is achieving its policy objectives. Loans have been available at lower cost than previously
and a range of indicators suggest that credit conditions are steadily improving for households and firms.
How much more borrowing there is in total will depend in part on what happens to the demand for credit, and
also (crucially) on banks’ assessment of the creditworthiness of borrowers. Bank staff projections for net
lending to the real economy, consistent with the MPC’s outlook for growth in the August Inflation Report and
with recent improvements in indicators of credit conditions, suggest that overall credit growth is likely to pick
up, becoming modestly positive overall during the second half of the year. This is also consistent with the
collective views of the FLS participants.
Conclusion

In conclusion, we have seen some very significant developments over the past year. Financial markets have
become less stressed about tail risks in the global economy and more stressed about the outlook for
monetary policy, particularly in the US. In the UK we appear to have seen an abrupt resurgence in business
and consumer confidence associated with renewed growth, albeit only at around trend rates so far. The
MPC remains committed to achieving its 2% inflation target but subject to that, and to continuing financial
stability, Bank Rate will not be raised until we have seen unemployment fall to at least 7% so we can explore
just how much spare capacity there is in the economy. Meanwhile the Funding for Lending Scheme
continues to support the supply of credit in the UK and has become more focussed on encouraging lending
to SMEs. The outlook – as always – remains very uncertain. But it is certainly a brighter picture than it was
a year ago, and with policy set to be supportive, there are good reasons for expecting that improvement to
continue.
