Operational risk and resilience
“Operational risk is the risk of disruption from systems and
processes, from human errors and management failures
and from external events and external actors.”

“ Operational resilience on the other hand, is the ability of
firms and the system as a whole to prevent, respond to,
recover and learn from operational disruptions.”

Figure 2: Impact of operational resilience on the objectives of the
authorities

Figure 2 illustrates the objectives which are most likely to be affected by operational resilience issues. It also illustrates that the consumer protection
objective is likely to be affected more often, and by more firms, than the market integrity, the safety and soundness, and financial stability objectives
