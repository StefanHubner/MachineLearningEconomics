The financial crisis revealed fundamental weaknesses in pre-crisis bank regulation. The regulatory response
internationally has been broad and deep. Whereas before the crisis, regulators struggled to keep up with
financial markets innovation, since the crisis banks have struggled to keep up with regulatory innovation.
That may continue for another year or so as reforms are finalised and implemented. But the broad shape of
the new bank regulatory regime is now clear.
And, as regulators, we should prepare for a period in which market innovation is likely to increase again –
both the good kind that improves services for customers and the more ambiguous kind in which firms adjust
their activities in response to regulatory constraints. We need to follow these adjustments closely in order to
understand the overall effect of regulatory change on banks and financial stability, and to identify, and where
appropriate address, any unintended consequences. I would like to use this time to explore some of the
possible effects, and focus on securities financing transactions as one area where tougher regulation is both
needed but might have wider consequences.

The new structure of bank capital regulation will comprise three core elements:

First, a foundation of loss absorbing capacity, designed to absorb losses when banks fail so that resolution
can take place without taxpayer support or huge damage to financial systems and the wider economy.

Second, a central structure of going concern capital requirements, with significant reforms to improve quality
and quantity.

And third, capital buffers forming a protective roof against rainy days, with higher buffers for
systemically-important firms, whose distress would do the most damage, and macroprudential authorities
able to increase buffers counter-cyclically when they see storm clouds gathering.

In the UK, as in other jurisdictions, we will also use more than one approach to assess the robustness of this
structure – with different approaches likely to bind on different firms, depending on their business models, at
different times.

First, the internationally-harmonised Basel risk-weighted ratio, intended to be risk sensitive and, in our view,
with some continuing role for firms’ internal models where we can be confident that they make use of firms’
internal information to improve risk sensitivity in a robust way. That debate continues internationally.

Second, the leverage ratio, which weights assets equally as a safeguard against errors in ex ante estimates
of risk and prevents excessive balance sheet stretch. In the UK, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has
recently announced its plans for leverage ratio requirements and buffers.

And third stress testing, to assess capital against the impact of macro-economic scenarios of current concern
to policymakers, in the UK modelled partly using firms’ internal models and partly our models. The results of
our first concurrent stress tests of major UK banks and building societies will be announced next month.

The new bank capital framework will cause banks to hold significantly more capital than the pre-crisis
regime. Major UK bank capital requirements and buffers have increased around seven-fold once you take
account of tougher definitions of capital, regulatory adjustments to asset valuations and higher risk weights
as well as the more obvious increases in headline ratio requirements and buffers.
But, to use the language of micro-economics, this significant change in regulatory capital requirements – the
‘relative prices’ of different risks – will lead to substitution as well as income effects. Over time, banks will
adjust their portfolios to changed capital requirements. The overall extent to which banks are better
capitalised and the financial system is more stable will depend on the scale and nature of these adjustments.
Any substitution effects are likely to be stronger if regulation is introduced inconsistently across countries. It
is important that we continue to seek consistency in implementing internationally-agreed standards.

One adjustment may be a shift in activity from banks to non-banks. That could be beneficial for financial
stability: for example, where long-term market-based finance provides an alternative to bank credit. But we
must be alert to the development of new forms of shadow banking, meaning substantial maturity
transformation and leverage outside the banking system.

The balance of activities may also shift between banks. The post-crisis reforms include additional capital
buffers for globally-systemically important banks (G-SIBs), and, as the Governor has said, the FSB is on
track to present a proposal for an international standard on total loss-absorbing capacity for these banks, to
2

the Brisbane G20 summit this month. These changes are intended to move G-SIBs further away from
distress and to make orderly resolution possible if, nonetheless, they do fail. But it is possible that tougher
regulation of G-SIBs might also encourage them to become less systemically-important over time, perhaps
with some shift of activity to smaller banks. At this stage, it is too early to tell. And, in the other direction,
there are some signs that higher regulatory requirements might be leading to greater concentration of activity
amongst the largest firms in certain markets: for example long-term derivatives. That might be consistent
with micro-economic theory, which suggests that, in oligopolistic markets with high fixed costs, an increase in
marginal costs due to higher regulatory capital requirements may tend to lead to a higher concentration of
activity amongst the biggest players (Chart 1). Authorities will need to monitor these trends closely.

Within the scope of their business models, individual banks are also likely to change their mix of activities in
response to changing regulatory requirements. Regulators will need to be alert for pure regulatory arbitrage
– seeking to change the form but not the economic substance of transactions in order to lower regulatory

requirements. We have already seen, for example, transactions seeking to take credit risk in the form of
derivatives rather than loans in order to lower the leverage exposure measure.

More legitimately, banks might switch from activities for which risk weights have increased to activities which
carry lower risk weights (Chart 2). The leverage ratio will, however, set an effective floor on the ability of
banks to improve their capital position by shifting into low risk-weighted assets, providing a safeguard against
uncertainties around our estimates of risk. Conversely, banks for which the leverage ratio is a binding
requirement may have incentives to move into higher risk-weighted activities (Chart 3) but the risk-weighted
ratio should limit the extent of any such risk shifting. In this way, the risk-weighted and leverage ratios
should complement one another. It will be interesting to see how banks allocate capital in a world where
they are subject to multiple capital constraints – risk-weighted, leverage and stress-test-based. In principle,
banks should allocate capital to individual business units based on the marginal capital requirements of
those activities to the bank as a whole – so if a bank overall is constrained by risk-weighted capital
requirements, it will allocate capital based on risk-weighted assets even to business units for which the
leverage ratio or stress test is binding on an individual basis. But as banks move closer to the critical point
at which the leverage ratio rather than the risk-weighted ratio becomes binding – an average risk weight of
35% based on a Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 3% and risk-weighted requirements and buffers of
3

8.5% – they will need to be increasingly mindful of both constraints.

The banking system will be substantially better capitalised in future than it was pre-crisis. But regulators will
need to follow closely how banks are adapting to tougher bank capital standards and identify any adverse
unintended consequences. Those might take the form, for example, of loopholes that provide an opportunity
for regulatory arbitrage, an unexpectedly significant impact on financial markets or a conflict with other
regulatory priorities, such as shifting derivatives markets towards central clearing. Where appropriate, we
will need a snagging process to review and adjust through the international regulatory bodies.

Securities financing transactions

One example of a market where tougher regulation was both needed but might have wider consequences is
securities financing.
Dealers run large securities financing ‘matched books’ in which they borrow cash against securities, lend
cash against securities, borrow securities against cash, lend securities against cash and borrow securities
against other securities. At first hearing, that sounds like a rather pointless daisy chain. But securities
financing markets are important (Chart 4). First, reverse repo transactions (short-term cash loans against
high-quality bonds) provide money-like assets for risk-averse wholesale investors, like money funds and
sovereign reserves managers. As Zoltan Poszar has shown, their demand for money, particularly in

3

8.5% is the sum of the 6% minimum Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer under Basel III.

US dollars, far outstrips traditional supply in the form of insured bank deposits or Treasury bills
(Poszar 2014). Securities financing markets fill the gap. Second, acting as prime brokers, dealers finance
the long and short positions of leveraged investors such as hedge funds. Third, securities financing markets
facilitate the flow of high-quality securities from their underlying beneficial owners, such as pension funds
and insurance companies, to banks and dealers which increasingly need to use and reuse them in order to
meet regulatory requirements to collateralise their obligations: for example, to other banks and dealers and
to central counterparty clearing houses.

Securities financing markets may be important but the financial crisis demonstrated that they can also be
fragile. Securities thought to be ‘safe’ collateral, such as AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities and
peripheral European sovereign bonds, became ‘risky’ collateral. Haircuts on lending against those securities
increased (Chart 5). Both the risk-averse money-seeking investors and the leveraged risk-seeking investors
on either side of the dealers’ balance sheets questioned the liquidity and solvency of many of those dealers.
Maturities shortened dramatically until most transactions were at overnight maturities, rolling daily
(Gorton et al, 2014). Some dealers experienced ‘runs’. Financing terms for leveraged investors tightened
sharply, causing some to fire sale assets and adding to market instability. In the US, the market
infrastructure was flawed, with the daily unwind of tri-party repo transactions relying on massive intra-day
financing from private sector clearing banks.

Since the crisis, regulators have addressed many of the underlying problems of excessive leverage and
maturity transformation:
a. Securities financing transactions are included in the internationally-agreed leverage exposure
4

measure adopted by the Basel Committee . Leverage ratio requirements will put prudent limits
on the size of dealers’ matched books.
b. They are also included in the Basel Committee’s measures to address liquidity risks. The
5

recently-announced Net Stable Funding Ratio will require short-term secured loans to financial
and non-financial borrowers to be backed by at least 10% stable funding. And supervisors can
6

use the Liquidity Coverage Ratio , as we have been doing for some time in the UK, to require
dealers to hold liquid assets against prime brokerage risks such as withdrawal of cash margin by
hedge fund clients.

The Financial Stability Board has agreed minimum haircuts in order to limit the leverage that
non-banks can obtain through borrowing cash against private sector securities. These haircut
floors have deliberately been set at ‘backstop’ levels designed to prevent excess in times of
market exuberance while allowing room for prudent firms to do their own risk management.

d. The US authorities have taken steps to strengthen the tri-party infrastructure.

The reforms are not yet complete. One important missing ingredient is data collection to monitor market
trends more closely. For example, the authorities need to understand the composition of the collateral being
used across key financial markets in order to identify concentrations. The financial crisis showed the risks
associated with a market-wide margin call when widely-used collateral is subject to an unexpected common
price shock. Data is also needed to track the terms of transactions, including maturity and haircuts. One
interesting idea is for regulators to run exercises in which they ask prime brokers to calculate portfolio
haircuts against archetypal leveraged portfolios. The aims would be both to track any loosening in
market-wide standards over time and to spot outlier dealers that require lower haircuts than their
competitors.

These significant regulatory reforms will have consequences for the behaviour of dealers and investors in
securities financing markets. Some market participants may seek ways around the new regulations: for
example, there has been talking about dealers ‘renting’ balance sheet from other market participants or
establishing off-balance sheet financing vehicles. The flipsides of more resilient dealers and markets in
periods of stress may well be less leverage, less maturity transformation and lower dealer inventories in
more normal periods. The balance is not easy to strike; we may need to readjust our approach as we learn.

But the goal of these reforms is clear: to make securities financing markets resilient. Robust securities
financing markets should help to stabilise rather than destabilise the financial system in the face of shocks.
The reduction in dealer inventories has attracted a lot of comment, with questions about whether they will be
willing and able to provide liquidity as market makers in falling markets on the same scale as in the past.
But the role of dealers in providing stable financing to leveraged investors may be equally important. Those
investors may be the most likely to see a market crash as a buying opportunity - but only if they are not
over-leveraged and have access to borrowing from financially-sound dealers. Put another way, we want
dealers and leveraged investors to be providers not demanders of liquidity in a crisis.

Chart 1: Higher capital requirements and market concentration

(a)

In an oligopolistic market, assume banks that invested first have a higher market share and are more
profitable for a given level of costs than the banks that invested second. Higher capital requirements
push the profits of the banks with smaller market shares below the fixed cost, causing them to exit,
while the profits of banks with larger market shares remain above the fixed cost and they remain in
the market. The market becomes more concentrated.

Chart 2: A bank substitutes investment in a lower-risk-weighted asset for investment in a
higher-risk-weighted asset when the risk weight for the higher-risk-weighted asset increases

A bank chooses a portfolio of assets where its indifference curve is tangent to its risk-based capital
constraint. An increase in the risk weight on the higher-risk-weighted assets relative to the risk weight
on the lower-risk-weighted assets induces a bank to decrease its investment in the higher-riskweighted assets and increase its investment in the lower-risk-weighted assets.

Chart 3: A bank invests more in a higher-risk-weighted asset when facing a binding leverage
ratio constraint as well as a risk-weighted capital ratio constraint

A bank that faces only a risk-weighted capital constraint chooses a more highly leveraged portfolio
consisting mainly of the lower-risk-weight asset. The introduction of the leverage constraint means
this portfolio choice is no longer available. Faced with both constraints, the bank switches to a
portfolio with more investment in the higher-risk-weighted asset and less in the low-risk-weighted
asset. But the risk-weighted capital constraint limits the extent of that switch.
