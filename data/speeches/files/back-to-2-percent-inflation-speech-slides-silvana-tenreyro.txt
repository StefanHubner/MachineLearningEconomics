Back to 2% Inflation?
The Credibility of Government Policies:
Conference in Honor of Guillermo Calvo,
Columbia University, New York

Silvana Tenreyro
External member of the Monetary Policy Committee

Key Points
• Rise in energy prices was a large terms-of-trade shock.
• Large cross country differences in effects and required responses.

• Policymakers, including in the UK, tightened policy sharply.
• Shape of the shock + policy lags:
• Limits to how much could be offset.
• Suggests risks of overtightening (undershooting 2% target in medium term).

• Scaling up to reach 2%
inflation in 2022 would imply
policy rate above 30%.
• Implied medium-term
inflation would be extremely
far below 2%.
