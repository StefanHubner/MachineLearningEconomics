‘Financial Crisis and G20 Financial Regulatory Reform: An Overview’

At the FSB and Korean G20 Presidential Committee Conference, Korea

3 September 2010

Session 2: Financial Crisis and G20 Financial Regulatory Reform: An Overview

Speaker: Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, Bank of England

Being a Western financial official, one comes to Asia with some humility in truth. This has been a
financial crisis born and bred in the Western world, but inflicted throughout the world.

That makes it all the more important that Korea and the other countries in Asia and elsewhere in
the emerging market world are involved in the reform efforts. The reforms are not simply going to
be cooked up in the West where the problems were bred. In Korea, you have to play a really
important leadership role, especially in steering us through the next couple of months.

Much of the work towards the Leaders summit is being handled in the Financial Stability Board.
And here is a very brief overview of what is going on in the FSB contribution to the G20 effort,
under the following headings: 1) surveillance; 2) bank capital and liquidity; 3) too big to fail; 4)
capital markets; 5) incentives; and finally the regulatory perimeter.

1. Surveillance of the system

Very obviously this was a crisis that was not spotted – in the most important sense of being
prevented – ahead of time.

People did issue warnings about developing leverage in the system and accumulating
macroeconomic imbalances. But no one acted to make the financial system more resilient to those
vulnerabilities. This was not just an intellectual failure, as is widely discussed and recognized
now. It was also partly a failure of machinery.

The FSB has been encouraging new machinery to survey and head off risks. The FSB itself has
created a vulnerabilities group. It is probably the least prominent part of the Financial Stability
Board’s effort to date, but it could have enduring significance over the years and decades. It is
paralleled in various regions.

2

Europe is setting up a Systemic Risk Board, which will be supported by the ECB but involve all
of the EU. The USA is setting up a Systemic Oversight Council; and in the UK, the government is
establishing a macroprudential Financial Policy Committee in the Bank of England. Maybe
something is needed in Asia, too. Martin [Wolf] talked about complacency; for the machinery I
have described to make any difference, people will have to stick to it year in and year out.

2. Supervision of Individual firms

One of the things that should not be neglected is that the severity of this crisis was as great as it
was partly because a large handful of individual massive firms failed due to poor management
and weak balance sheets.

Part of the solution lies, therefore, in much better microprudential supervision and regulation of
individual firms. The Basel Committee has had Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision
for some considerable time now. But, going beyond that, the FSB has encouraged and is
sponsoring an exercise on effective supervision of SIFIs, Significantly Important Financial
Institutions.

A remarkable fact is that although the style of banking supervision varies enormously across the
world, almost nothing seems to have been done to get to the bottom of the question of which
approaches are the more effective – having an army of on-site examiners, such as for example in
the United States; or relying on offsite analysis, which tends to be the pattern in much of Europe.

An exercise led by Julie Dickson for the Financial Stability Board is producing an evaluation of
what is needed to supervise the largest firms in the world effectively. The idea is that that will
either get encapsulated in an FSB code or in a re-draft of the Basel Core Principles for Effective
Supervision.

3. Capital and Liquidity

The third element is capital and liquidity. Virtually all crises have at their root over leverage in
the financial sector and excessive maturity mismatch. We need to overhaul the corresponding
policy instruments –capital and liquidity requirements.

3

On liquidity, Basel is introducing an accord for minimum liquidity requirements for the first time;
this is about a quarter of a century after it was first contemplated and so rather overdue, but
therefore very welcome. There is an awful lot of debate around this still. Many in the industry – in
the banking industry – have been resisting it. But this will happen. It will lay down minimum
standards for banks to hold some resiliently liquid assets and about the funding of illiquid assets.

To date, much more prominent has been the work on capital. Although there has been some
dilution of the proposals from a few months ago, real substantive progress is being made in
reforming the minimum standards and in introducing various buffers, taking into account credit
cycle conditions and the circumstances of SIFIs. The key element of the overall package is that
‘capital’ will mean capital. The world of hybrid instruments – pretending to be so-called capital
instruments but which in fact cannot truly absorb losses in a going concern – should become more
or less a thing of the past. The Bank of England would like it to be completely consigned to the
past. Only equity can absorb losses.

For that reason, in calculating regulatory capital, deductions from capital should really be from
equity. As part of the emerging compromise, there will be some derogations from that, but the
derogations should be transparent. Markets should learn to evaluate bank’s capital adequacy on
the basis of what is made transparent about the makeup of that capital.

The other really key change will come in stages – partly in the package this autumn and partly
during next year and beyond – which is reducing the pernicious regulatory arbitrage that has
existed between ‘banking book’ capital requirements and ‘trading book’ capital requirements. Far
too many instruments that were held in the trading book were subject to low capital requirements
but actually could not be traded, leaving values exposed to big swings in liquidity premia. This
was a fatal design flaw in the existing regime, and it is one which I hope should be fixed over the
next year or so though the Basel Committee’s ‘fundamental review of the trading book’.

4. Too Big To Fail

At the centre of the reform effort in the FSB work is ‘Too Big To Fail.’ If one of the largest firms
in the world got into trouble right now, in almost every country in the world we would not be able
to cope with its demise other than through fiscal support.

This is completely unacceptable.
4

If there is one thing that I think unites the members of the G20—at the political level and at the
official level – it is that this will be consigned to the past. We will re-introduce market discipline
back into the financial system, which really means re-introducing capitalism back into the heart of
capitalism. The acid test has to be whether, for every financial institution in the world, it could be
resolved if it faces distress in a way that does not disrupt the flow of essential financial services to
the economy and without state solvency support. That is the single goal in this area. When
achieved, it can transform the global financial system more than anything else.

It’s not for me to set out the ideas today (Svein will do so later), but there are ideas developing
that I believe will, in at least some key centres, become concrete policies for putting losses in the
largest firms in the world not just onto shareholders but onto their unsecured, uninsured creditors
rather than onto taxpayers. I would expect that over time to lead to adjustments in the business
models and organization of the most significant firms in the world. What’s more, on the whole, I
think they will welcome that.

5. Capital Markets

The next element of the reform programme is capital markets. Too much of the reform debate has
probably revolved around banks, both in response to this crisis and in response to earlier crises.
We live in a world where financial intermediation does not just go via banks and insurance
companies, but it goes via capital markets and the vast array of institutions, investors and issuers
that the capital markets encourage into existence.

I will highlight just two key changes on this front. One, there is a determination that a lot more
OTC (over- the-counter) derivative activity will go through central counterparties, rather than
being settled bi-laterally. This can have enormous benefits in terms of laying down standards for
collateralisation, valuations, and ensuring transparency of what is going on in those markets.
There is a residual question about how much of that activity should go via exchanges or via other
trading platforms. That’s something which I doubt will be completely resolved this year. I think it
will remain part of the G20 and the FSB agenda going into next year. But it is a very important
part.

Another key element of changing capital markets is much greater transparency around, and much
reduced reliance on, credit rating agency ratings. One of the problems in global capital markets
5

has been that too many investors and banks have given up on reaching their own view on
borrowers and on instruments, but have effectively subordinated their own judgment to the
judgment of credit rating agencies. The FSB is sponsoring and leading work in order to reduce the
extent to which credit rating agency ratings are inscribed into, or embedded in the regulatory
fabric of our capital markets.

6. Incentives

The sixth thing is incentives. The issue that gets most attention here is compensation or pay, on
which the FSB issued a code. The essence of that is that more pay should be deferred. I would add
that perhaps part of deferred compensation should be in the form of a debt contract, so that the
managers and workers in large firms eventually become creditors of the firm and so they
themselves have the same risks as other debt holders. That works only if we can develop
resolution regimes leaving debt holders taking risks in our largest firms. So that comes back to
whether or not we can resolve the largest firms in an effective way and so can re-introduce market
discipline through that route.

7. Concluding Remarks

Let me conclude with something on shadow banking.

Martin [Wolf] talked about the grave problems that are present in the global financial system
through global imbalances. I completely agree. To the extent that we do not solve the global
imbalances problem, our financial system will need to be more resilient than otherwise. That must
be understood.

Global capital flows are one of the givens of the world that we will continue to live in. The other
given, in my view, is regulatory arbitrage. The biggest misjudgment that our predecessors made in
the 1980’s and 1990’s was to underestimate the ferocious ability of capitalism to arbitrage
regulatory rules. That will not change. Therefore, whatever rules we put in place now, capitalism
will find ways around them.

An important element of the reforms therefore has to be a much greater consciousness of
regulatory arbitrage and a willingness to do something about it. This must not mean charging after
windmills. It means identifying where something is happening that could threaten stability from
6

outside the regulated sector, and being prepared to move the perimeter of regulation in those
circumstances. The authorities must be more interested in shadow banking. That is something that
the FSB, I believe, should focus on next year.

I hope that brief overview of the FSB’s work can help our deliberations and exchanges today.
Thank you.
