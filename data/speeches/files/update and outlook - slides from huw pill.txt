GDP broadly flat but PMIs have picked up of late

Activity in the UK remains subdued, as the level of GDP was flat over the month in
February. Bank staff continue to expect GDP to decline by 0.1% in 2023 Q1, as had
been projected in the February MPR.

•

PMIs have picked up notably of late, suggesting there is scope for modest growth in
output and employment.

•

Composite output expectations PMI continued to strengthen (and was revised up
from the flash estimate), pointing to much stronger prospective growth than any of
the other business survey indicators that we track.

•

But there are mixed signals from other surveys, suggesting the collective steer from
business surveys continues to point towards uncertain growth expectations.

We have observed financial tensions in recent weeks, reflected in developments in US
and European banking markets. The impact on UK financial conditions and credit
markets so far appears to be contained.

•

Bank funding costs and corporate bond spreads rose in the immediate aftermath of
the distress but have fallen from recent highs, marking a stabilisation risk sentiment.

•

Overall borrowing costs, taking into account the impact of a rising Bank Rate, are
higher as monetary policy tightening transmits through the financial system.

•

MPC remains vigilant to signs of tightening financial conditions and will be prepared
to respond to the macro implications of any dislocation to credit markets to the
extent that they influence the outlook for inflation.

•

Thus far, aggregate lending measures have slowed only slightly and lenders have
adjusted lending conditions to changes in the risk environment, but not re-trenched
beyond this.

•

The continued weakness of net mortgage lending to households in February, which
declined for the sixth consecutive months, consistent with weaker demand and
tighter lending conditions.

•

Meanwhile, sterling broad money flow (M4ex) decreased sharply in February, driven
mainly driven by negative NIOFCs’ M4 net flows. This followed an all time high in
December and all time low in September of last year. In annual growth rate terms
M4ex decreased to 3.0% in February, falling below it’s previous six month average.

Unemployment rate has stabilised at low levels as expected

•

Consistent with MPC expectations of a tight labour market, the unemployment rate
has remained near low levels.

•

Stronger employment growth in the data had been the counterpart to a fall in the
inactivity rate of the 16+ population. LFS data for 2022 Q4 suggested that the flow into
inactivity from employment and unemployment had fallen to around pre-Covid
levels, alongside a decline in the share of the inactive aged 50-64 who did not expect
to work again.

I shared some reflections on drivers of bargaining power and inflation persistence in
Geneva a few weeks ago (Inﬂa on persistence and monetary policy − speech by Huw Pill | Bank
of England). As the impact of higher energy prices on UK real incomes and spending
power unwinds, the scope for intrinsic inflation persistence will determine appropriate
monetary policy choices.

•

Whilst monetary policymakers don’t have a mandate to make distributional
judgements, their decisions do have implications for aggregate demand which in turn
influence the power and position of participants in the bargaining process between
households and firms.

•

Labour market indicators of bargaining power include the evolution of
unemployment, the extent of mismatch in the labour market and the pace of churn
in the market. The latter two of these measures have eased of late, from historically
high levels that characterise the current tightness in the labour market.

•

Pay growth has eased, evidenced by indicators of earnings across the whole
economy and private sector. Moreover, high frequency indicators of momentum in
wage developments appear to be easing. Three-month-on-three-month annualised
private sector regular pay growth is 5.5%, its lowest level since December 21, and is
now below the annualised rate.

•

Sample variability could explain these developments, but forward-looking indicators
such as the REC have been pointing to a deceleration for some time. That may partly
reflect lower actual and expected inflation, with Agency intelligence suggesting that
some companies expect pay settlements to ease over the course of the year, as
inflation recedes.

•

CPI inflation rose to 10.4% in February, from 10.1% in January. This was a material
upside surprise to our February MPR projection. Core inflation rose to 6.2 and services
inflation at 6.6% was largely isolated to catering services.

•

Higher-than-expected food price inflation accounted for two-fifths of the upside news
to our latest nowcast on inflation. The ONS noted that food shortages might have
been at play.

•

We still expect CPI inflation to fall in Q2, as large rises in energy prices from last year
drop out of the annual comparison, and to a lower rate than in the MPR projection
following the announcements in the latest Government Budget to freeze the EPG and
fuel duties

•

Recent releases serve as a reminder that the precise path of inflation may be
bumpier than we expect.
