Introduction

Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.

Few would disagree that we are living through possibly the most turbulent and difficult economic period for
over 80 years. Looking back from where we stand today, output in the United Kingdom has been broadly flat
for almost two years following a very deep recession, and the outlook for 2013 is more subdued than we
would have thought some six months ago. This has inevitably led to criticism that monetary policy has had
little traction and that we are condemned to a “lost decade” of economic stagnation and declining living
standards. Today, I would like to set out the reasons why I do not share such a pessimistic view of the
economic outlook and the role of monetary policy.

Let me first explain why I think economic performance in the United Kingdom has been so weak and what
has been the impact of policy to date. I will then turn to the outlook for the economy and the role for
monetary policy, particularly in light of the recent discussion around the MPC’s inflation targeting remit and
the update to the Monetary Policy Framework announced by the Chancellor. Overall, and perhaps most
importantly, I would like to leave you with a few reasons why I have some hope for the UK economy in 2013
and beyond.

Why has UK economic growth been so disappointing?

This has been a lethargic recovery, on the heels of a deep and prolonged recession. Real output is still
some 20% below its pre-crisis trend, assuming that the average rate of growth prior to the crisis had
remained unchanged (Charts 1 and 2). Let me set out the reasons why I think growth has been so
disappointing, which I suspect are more diverse and complex than sometimes portrayed.

History suggests that financial crises are usually associated with a number of legacies which generate
substantial headwinds to the subsequent recovery.1 There is evidence to believe that three have been an
important determinant of recent UK performance.

First, the shock to the UK banking system revealed that some banks at least were undercapitalised and
needed to reduce the substantial amount of leverage that had been built up prior to the crisis. This has led to
significant constraints on lending to households and businesses. But the banks are not alone in seeking to
get their house in order. Consumers have also focused on saving more and limiting their indebtedness,
illustrated by the fall in the household debt-to-income ratio of 27 percentage points from its peak in early
2009 (Chart 3), and this has constrained the pace of consumer spending. Third, the impact on public

finances of the shrinkage of the economy, the fiscal support through the recession and the direct cost of
bank rescue means that some form of fiscal austerity became inevitable. These three factors together act as
significant headwinds to growth, and dictate that any recovery was always going to be slow and difficult,
compared with more normal economic cycles.

But over the past couple of years, growth has turned out even weaker than the Bank (and others) forecast in
2010.2 This may have been due to some underestimation of the scale and duration of these legacy
headwinds from the financial crisis. But more importantly it also reflects a number of other shocks to the
system.


In addition to dealing with their debt levels, consumers have had to contend with a period of elevated
inflation, reflecting the rise in import prices following the 25% depreciation of sterling from 2007 to
2009; the surge in energy prices driven by increased political uncertainty following the Arab spring; a
rise in food prices caused by unfavourable weather conditions; and the rise in value added tax. And
more recently, increases in administered and regulated prices have also added to inflation. As a
result, consumers have been faced with a dramatic squeeze in their real incomes, which have fallen
by around 5% over four years.



The United Kingdom has also been at the mercy of a global slowdown. Throughout 2011 and into
2012, the slowing of many emerging market economies, notably China, as well as the supply chain
disruption emanating from the tsunami in Japan made it more difficult for the UK to source imports
and sell its exports. World trade grew just 2% in 2012, down from 5.2% in 2011. And, closer to
home, over the past year the recession in the euro area, our main trading partner, has had an even
more direct impact on the United Kingdom, depriving our economy of much-needed external
demand.



Compounding these factors has been the uncertainty arising from the ongoing crisis in the
euro-area. Surveys of large UK businesses show that concerns over the euro-area crisis continue to
have a large negative impact on business investment. And this uncertainty has also made it more
expensive for banks, including those in the UK, to obtain funding, adding to the constraints on credit
growth.

So where does that leave us? UK growth over the past two years can be characterised as weak, at best.
Headline GDP growth in 2012 was only 0.3%. But I feel that the picture has been made worse in popular
consciousness by a number of features which have made it all the more difficult to assess the underlying
health of the economy. First, quarterly growth has been very erratic: the additional Diamond Jubilee bank
2

This is also true for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In November 2010, the OBR forecast annual growth to be 2.1% and
2.6% in 2011 and 2012 respectively, higher than the realised growth rates of 0.8% and 0.3% in these two years.

holiday no doubt contributed to the 0.5% contraction in Q2, while the Olympics delivered a temporary boost
in Q3 which then reversed in the last quarter of 2012. Second, the weakness in total GDP was heavily
affected by the weakness in two particular sectors. If we adjust overall GDP growth for the sharp falls in
construction and North Sea oil output, the rest of the economy – over 90% of GDP – grew by 1.2% last year.
I do not wish to sound complacent; growth of even 1.2% across much of the economy is still at best a slow
and difficult recovery. But it is also somewhat removed from the reports of semi-permanent, triple dip,
recession.

What has been the impact of policy?

Let me start by briefly outlining the current, extraordinary, policy landscape. Following the provision of
emergency liquidity to commercial banks as the financial crisis took hold, the MPC rapidly reduced Bank
Rate to 0.5% (Chart 4) – its lowest level ever. The introduction of the Bank’s Asset Purchase Facility,
popularly known as Quantitative Easing (QE), has helped to provide further monetary stimulus over the last
four years (Chart 5) by lowering long-term interest rates and supporting asset prices and spending by firms
and households.

There has been much debate about the effectiveness of QE, but it would be wrong to conclude that the
sluggish performance of the economy is, by itself, evidence that it hasn’t worked. One would need to start by
answering the question: what would have happened in the absence of policy action? In my view, the UK
economy would have fared significantly worse if the Bank had not responded to the deteriorating economic
environment with unconventional policy easing.

One area where QE has had limited impact is on bank lending. It is a common misconception that the policy
was designed to support banks, and bank lending, directly. In fact, most of our asset purchases have been
from non-bank investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. By increasing the amount of
reserves in the economy, QE may have helped to improve the liquidity position of banks, thereby indirectly
encouraging more lending. But the headwinds facing the banking sector have meant that this impact on
bank lending has been limited. And over the past couple of years, stress from the euro area has meant that
UK banks have had to pay more to borrow in wholesale markets. It is in light of this that the Funding for
Lending Scheme (FLS) was introduced in 2012 to help reduce the funding costs of UK banks and encourage
them to lend more to the real economy.

Since its introduction last summer, the FLS has helped to reduce the cost of funding for UK banks, which in
turn is starting to have an impact on bank lending rates. So far, the main impact has been seen in the
mortgage market, where availability has risen and loan rates have come down, across a number of LTV
mortgages (Chart 6). As yet, the impact on lending criteria for the SME sector has been less marked,
though it was always expected that changes in lending to this sector would take longer than in the mortgage

market. However, the cost of loans to companies has also fallen slightly since the middle of 2012, and some
lenders are using cashback deals or fee reductions to pass on the benefits of lower funding costs. The
impact of the FLS is likely to be more marked in coming months; the Bank’s latest Credit Conditions Survey
shows that the recent improvement in the availability of credit, particularly in the household mortgage sector,
is expected to continue (Chart 7).

While these are encouraging signs, we have yet to see a pickup in the levels of lending to the real economy
(Chart 8). Aggregate net lending to households and businesses by those banks participating in the FLS fell
by around £2.5bn in the last quarter of 2012. But I do not agree with some commentators that this is
evidence that the FLS is not working. The small reduction in net lending at the end of last year likely
reflected normal seasonal factors and a bank-by-bank analysis showed that the weakness was largely
confined to those banks undergoing significant balance sheet restructuring, much of which reflected plans
agreed with the authorities to reduce non-core business. And, given that it will take time for lower bank
funding costs (and the extra incentives to lend provided by the FLS) to be reflected in increased lending, I
think it is too early to judge the full effects of the FLS on bank lending volumes.

What is the outlook for the UK economy?

A number of factors make me hopeful for the UK economy through 2013 and into 2014.

First, credit conditions are improving, in part due to the impact of the FLS, with some signs that lending to
households will pick up in the coming quarters. An improvement in the housing market, combined with
resilient employment should help to support modest growth in consumption, albeit that low nominal wage
growth and persistent above-target inflation will continue to squeeze real purchasing power.

Second, business investment, which was concentrated in utility and energy sectors over the last year, may
start to show some recovery in other sectors over the next 18 months. I have been struck, on recent regional
visits, by the improvement in business sentiment relative to last summer and autumn, much of which has
been due to the perceived reduction in the tail risk of a disruptive and sudden unravelling of the euro area.
Larger firms are also benefiting from an active corporate bond market which places them in a strong position
to invest. However, confidence is still fragile, so any pickup in investment is likely to be gradual, particularly
as many companies are also struggling with the impact of rising pension liabilities, which may divert cash
away from investment spending.

Third, the international outlook is improving – there are some encouraging signs that the slowdown in China
is ending and the recovery in the US is gaining momentum – benefitting UK exports. And there is growing
evidence – from conversations with Bank agents as well as the detail of the trade statistics – that UK

businesses are now starting to succeed in re-orienting their exports into the faster-growing emerging
markets, reducing our dependence on the slow-growth markets closer to home.

Overall, I am hopeful for a modest pickup in growth as some of the negative factors that have made the last
couple of years so difficult start to fade, and as levels of confidence, so badly battered by the impact of the
euro crisis, start to heal.

The outlook for inflation is more concerning. Inflation has been persistently above the 2% target for the past
five years (Chart 9). Late last year, inflation picked up rather sharply, reflecting increases in university tuition
fees and domestic energy bills. Very recently, inflation has edged up higher. It now stands just shy of 3%,
uncomfortably close to the letter-writing threshold, and is expected to remain elevated for much of the next
two years.

A flexible inflation targeting framework

The combination of at best a slow recovery in activity with persistent above-target inflation poses a real
challenge to the MPC, of a degree that is more acute now than at any time since the MPC’s inception
15 years ago. Faced with this trade-off, how should the MPC set monetary policy?

At the February MPC meeting, the Committee judged that inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target
for the next two years, returning to the target only by the end of the third year of our forecast. This prompted
an outcry from some commentators who took this as evidence that the MPC had “gone soft on inflation”. Let
me stress that we have not “gone soft”. We remain committed to delivering price stability in the medium
term.

Let me further explain why I believe it is appropriate in the current environment to tolerate above-target
inflation over the next two years and why this is entirely consistent with the MPC’s remit.

Most importantly, the decision to accommodate current above-target inflation is based on a careful analysis
of the particular reasons behind the upward pressure on prices.

Much of the upward pressure comes from two sources. First, administered and regulated prices, such as
university tuition fees and network charges for energy utilities. The contribution from these prices to CPI is
particularly high at present (Chart 10), adding around 1 percentage point to inflation in each of the next
couple of years. They are determined by regulatory decisions, rather than the balance of domestic supply
and demand, so are relatively insensitive to monetary policy. But while their impact is expected to be felt for
the next couple of years, it is effectively a shift in relative prices, and should not have a permanent effect on
the rate of CPI inflation.

The second shock to inflation has been the recent depreciation of sterling, and the effect on the prices of
imports. How policy should respond to this is a more complex question. To the extent that a fall in the
currency reflects real factors, such as a need to rebalance the economy towards exports or an unwinding of
haven flows, it would not be sensible to prevent the real adjustment by tightening monetary policy. If,
however, the weakness in sterling were deemed to reflect concerns regarding the Bank’s anti-inflation
credibility, leading to an increase in inflation expectations, then I strongly believe that the case for
accommodation is much weaker. So far, there is little evidence that inflation expectations have become
de-anchored, while domestic inflationary pressures, in particular wage growth, remain very subdued.
The current shocks to inflation are therefore such that, in my view, it remains appropriate to look through
them. Indeed, in these circumstances, we would only be able to bring inflation back to the target more quickly
by depressing domestic activity and hence possibly derailing the recovery.

Our current policy stance, I would argue, is fully consistent with the MPC’s remit. The Committee’s remit has
always embodied a flexible inflation target, with an explicit, though secondary, requirement to support the
Government’s objective of high and stable growth and employment. During the first 15 years of the MPC’s
existence, prior to the financial crisis, that auxiliary goal did not conflict with the objective of delivering low
and stable inflation. But the crisis has crystallised the need to make full use of the flexibility afforded by the
Bank’s remit – to deliver price stability in a way that avoids undesirable volatility in output. Making use of
such flexibility, as recently confirmed by the Chancellor’s decision to update the MPC’s mandate, is in no
way a departure from the inflation targeting framework in place since 1997.

Conclusion

We are still living in very uncertain times. The economic recovery over the next year or so will continue to be
slow and difficult, but I hope I have provided some reasons why the headwinds of the past may now be
starting to ease, and why I remain cautiously optimistic about the road ahead. On balance, I think the
outlook is now looking more encouraging than for some time. Of course, there remain substantial risks that
may still knock us off course, not least from the challenges facing the euro area, and if required, the MPC
stands ready to respond.
