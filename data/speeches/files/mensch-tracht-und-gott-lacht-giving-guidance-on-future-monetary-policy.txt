1. Introduction
“Mensch tracht, und Gott lacht" is a Yiddish proverb – men plan and God laughs. Woody Allen puts the
1

same thought this way: “If you want to make God laugh tell him about your plans”. Some people might see
these as a fitting epitaph for forward guidance on monetary policy. The Bank of England has certainly faced
a good deal of criticism for the guidance that it has recently been giving, as has the Federal Reserve in the
US. In both cases the nature of the guidance has evolved, though I think it is rather harsh to assume that
God has been laughing at how things have gone; anyway it is hard to know. Yet there is a real question
here that is worth thinking about and it is this: What is the most useful way for a central bank to provide
information about the way in which it will set monetary policy?
2

Consider a spectrum of choices a central bank might face about what it says about its future policies : at one
3

end of the spectrum (the minimalist end, which we might call the Montagu Norman side ) is just a statement
that the central bank will continue to do what it sees as most appropriate over time. In the absence of a
more precise statement about what constitutes “appropriate” this is probably about as vague as one can
imagine. At the other end of the spectrum is an explicit commitment that policy will be set in a specific way at
each point into the future – not just a rule that might be followed but a commitment to a particular policy
setting. If we think of policy as being about the level of an interest rate set by the central bank (Bank Rate
for the Bank of England) this second extreme end of the spectrum means a promise to set the interest rate
along a specific path into the future. Between these two are a great many intermediate points: nearer the
vague end – though meaningfully different from it – is an explicit statement of the goal of policy (e.g. an
inflation target) but with little indication of how the central bank sees the link between its policy instrument
and that goal or about what the current economic outlook is. Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum
would be a fairly precise statement of the aim of policy (the targets) along with an assessment of the state of
the economy and a (probabilistic) assessment of how the economy might evolve for a particular (fixed and
perhaps arbitrary) setting of the policy instruments. Further along again might be an assessment of how the
policy set by the central bank might evolve for different outcomes of some of the main forces driving the
economy. That would tell you something about the central bank’s reaction function and also its assessment
of the nature of the economic environment and how it might evolve.

Forward guidance can mean many things. I think it is helpful to think about forward guidance as being a
choice about which point to settle on along the spectrum I have described.

That is the question I want to address today.

1

Mike Tyson made a related - but different – point when he said “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth”.
In talking about a spectrum I am talking somewhat loosely. A spectrum suggests that there is just one dimension in which
communication about policy can be varied. In practice there is more than one dimension.

Let me start by making two simple points.

My first point is that on this issue there is not a lot of generally agreed upon and directly applicable economic
theory to help. To a large extent this is because in many standard economic models this is really a
non-question – it simply does not arise. Suppose we assume that everyone in an economy is completely
rational, has unlimited computational powers, has the same information and understands the processes
driving the economic outcomes. They all share a common understanding about the links between monetary
policy and economic outcomes and they share common (but imperfect) information about where the
economy is today and the sorts of shocks that will buffet it over time. (They do not know what those shocks
will be but understand the risks). In this idealised world then so long as the central bank can credibly commit
4

to pursue an explicit and completely specified objective then there is not much more to be said. People
outside the central bank will work out what the optimal policy the central bank will follow given how the
economy seems to be evolving. They will form the same expectations about the course of future policy as
the central bank itself because they share a common view about how the economy works and make the
same assessment about the probabilities of different future outcomes. All the central bank needs to do is
say what its aims are. If these are precise and seen as something the central bank will pursue then people
can figure out what it will do, depending on how the shocks that hit the economy play out.
There are a few wrinkles to this. Under some circumstances optimal policy might be time inconsistent – that
is a situation when the central bank plan which is optimal today is no longer optimal at some point in the
future simply because of the (entirely predictable) passage of time and not because of some news. And it
might be that such time-inconsistency could be more likely if interest rates are stuck at the zero lower bound.
5

But time inconsistency is a slightly tangential issue . The main point is that when everyone shares common
information and understanding (and that is the default assumption in many economic models) the central
bank just needs to say what its aims are, which must involve not only some medium term targets but also
how it will trade-off deviations from the targets. In the idealised world of many economic models people can
6

then just go figure out the rest. Giving guidance on future policy is generally irrelevant here . So in terms of
the spectrum of points described above there just isn’t one. When everyone has the same information –
7

including about the objectives of the central bank – there is nothing else to talk about .

4

An example of a specific objective would be to make as small as possible a weighted average of deviations of inflation and output from
specified levels over some horizon stretching into the future. An objective that was just to hit a target “over the medium term” would be
too vague to allow people to figure out what the central bank would do in various circumstances.
5
Woodford (2013) has an extensive discussion of the conditions under which the optimal monetary policy of a central bank might be
time inconsistent. This depends upon the nature of the goals of the central bank which need to be precise enough to determine a policy
path. The key condition is that “…the sequence of target criteria for different horizons are of the same form (i.e., if the target criterion is
independent of the horizon)… then the forecast-targeting procedure will be inter-temporally consistent.” I believe that the way the MPC
interprets its goals satisfies this condition.
6
Generally but not always. In cases where the central bank’s credibility over a future path of interest rates is in doubt, guidance could be
seen as a commitment device, creating costs from deviating from a pre-announced plan which can help avoid inferior outcomes that can
arise if optimal monetary policy is time inconsistent. I believe that the aims of the Bank of England make the time inconsistency problem
unlikely to be very relevant (see footnote 5).
7
This may be rather too negative a conclusion to draw about the use of theories that assume common knowledge. Idealised models
without information frictions might still have a message about guidance because they suggest that central banks should do all they can
to remove information problems by being transparent about their objectives, about possible shocks and likely policy responses to them.

Of course this is very unrealistic – it requires common understanding between the central bank and everyone
else about the structure of the economy, the current state it is in and also perfect clarity about the precise
objectives of the central bank (including how it sees trade-offs between objectives). So it is not a very good
guide to the practical policy issue about what guidance the central bank should give. Real world
complexities – differences in information and the resources to interpret it; uncertainty about what the right
model of the economy is; the possibility that information might be misinterpreted; different views amongst
policy makers within the central banks – are just that: real.

The second simple point I want to make is that much of the most vocal recent criticism of guidance given by
central banks really reflects a seeming preference to take one of the extreme ends of my spectrum. And that
extreme end is very unlikely to be a good place to be. So for example in the UK the Bank of England (and
more specifically its Monetary Policy Committee) is very often criticised for “ flip-flopping”; for giving different
signals about policy at different times; for seeming to change its mind on the right path for policy; in short for
not providing certainty about policy. I think in many cases this boils down to the criticism that while the
Bank of England now claims to be giving guidance on policy it is not saying what policy will be – it is not
giving a specific path for interest rates, and not even saying when it is going to start raising rates. The
criticism is also that what the MPC is saying seems to change over time so that the chances of interest rates
moving along different paths seem to shift. So one frequently hears that the MPC’s message is confusing,
and that it should communicate more clearly. One version of this criticism is that the Bank lacks
transparency – a criticism that is open to many interpretations, one of which is that the Bank refuses to say
what it is going to do to interest rates, even though it could.

I do not take this criticism lightly. The Bank is accountable to the public, and it needs to clearly communicate
the reasons behind its policy decisions. The MPC goes to some lengths to explain its thinking and decisions.
The minutes of the MPC meetings are published two weeks after the interest rate decision; those minutes
give a full account of the policy discussion, including differences of view. They show the votes of the
individual members of the Committee. Committee members have to explain their decisions regularly to
parliamentary committees. The evidence is transmitted live. And MPC members also speak to audiences
throughout the country, explaining the MPC's policy decisions. These speeches are available on the Bank’s
website.

In addition to the monthly MPC minutes, the Bank publishes its Inflation Report every quarter. This report
gives an analysis of the UK economy and the factors influencing policy decisions. The Inflation Report also
includes the MPC's latest forecasts for key economic variables, and shows the assumptions under which
these forecasts were made. And the Bank publishes details of the main economic models that its staff use to
help the Committee make its forecasts.

I do not think the criticism that the MPC does not give much information about how it sets policy really stacks
up. Nonetheless a case can be made that the MPC should provide additional information – for example that
4

8

it should say more about its reaction function . And indeed the forward guidance that the MPC has been
giving is, in part, a response to that. But I think a great deal of the loudest criticism is not so much that the
MPC doesn’t say much about how it sets policy, but rather that the MPC is providing less certainty than it
could about interest rates.

And it is true that the MPC could commit to a certain path for future interest rates, and stick to it whatever
economic circumstances materialise. Indeed the more uncertain the economic environment, the more
valuable might people find it to have certainty about where interest rates are heading. Yet the greater the
uncertainty the greater are the chances that the economic environment will turn out to be very different from
what the MPC expected at the time they committed to an interest rate path. And this means that sticking to
that path can be very costly. In many models sticking to a particular path for interest rates over a specific
horizon can mean that at the end of that horizon interest rate may need to move dramatically to prevent
serious instability in the economy. If the certainty about the path of rates for some near horizon comes at the
cost of far higher uncertainty a bit down the road that hardly looks ideal.

To explore this issue of the effects of committing to a specific path for interest rates I will use a simple model
of the economy which accounts for uncertainty and explores how that should affect monetary policy.

2. A model of monetary policy under uncertainty

I want to use a simple model of the economy which takes account of uncertainty about the economic
environment and makes explicit assumptions about the aims of monetary policy. My aim is to assess how
much of a difference it would make if the central bank fixed the path for policy over the next few years rather
than making it conditional upon the way the economy actually pans out.

The model is reduced to the bare minimum (see the Annex for details). It has three parts, summarised in
three equations, which describe the evolution of output, inflation and supply capacity. Demand and output
are assumed to grow faster if interest rates, adjusted for inflation (i.e. real interest rates), are below average.
This is a standard demand relation – sometimes called the IS equation. Inflation is assumed to rise when
firms produce above their long-run level of supply – in other words there is a link between slack (or spare
capacity) and inflation. Finally I assume that supply capacity (more specifically, productivity growth) may
respond positively to output growth; this is a simple way of taking account of possible hysteresis effects. I
will assume that unless the central bank has committed to a specific path for interest rates it will vary them as
it learns about how inflation and output evolve. I assume that the way in which the interest rate responds to
inflation and production will be chosen by the central bank optimally in order to achieve its goals (goals which
are described below and set out explicitly in the annex).

8

Though this assumes there is a single, simple reaction function for a Committee of 9 members each of whom is responsible for their
own decisions.

This simple model allows me to incorporate a number of uncertainties that I think are particularly relevant for
the UK right now. The first is uncertainty about the degree of spare capacity in the economy. The second is
about the impact of monetary policy: since interest rates have been at such exceptionally low levels for so
long there is unusual uncertainty about how the return towards more usual levels will affect the economy.
The third source of uncertainty is how fast the economy grows in the absence of monetary stimulus (i.e. at a
neutral setting for policy). And the fourth source of uncertainty is about the extent to which productivity
growth responds positively to output growth. I believe that uncertainty about these four factors – slack, the
transmission mechanism of monetary policy, current momentum in the economy, and the endogeneity of
productive potential – is substantial and economically significant.

I calibrate the model in a fairly crude way to reflect what I think is a plausible view of how these economic
relationships operate, and of how large the associated uncertainties are. The appendix gives details.

I specify the aim of the central bank as being to try to keep inflation close to a target and output close to its
estimate of the supply capacity of the economy. More specifically, I assume that the central bank sets policy
to minimise the expected value of the weighted sum of squared deviations from the inflation target and from
supply capacity over a horizon stretching many years into the future. (Again the annex gives details). We
can then compute an optimal policy rule showing how the interest rate should respond to the (uncertain)
evolution of actual inflation and output so as to best achieve the aims of policy. What we are doing here is
finding that interest rate rule which best achieves the aims of policy and where the rule is chosen at the
outset when there is uncertainty about the economic environment. Using this rule we can then show how
policy would evolve for any specific realisation of the uncertain parameters which affect the path that inflation
and output actually take. This yields a range of paths for output, inflation and interest rates; each path is the
outcome for a specific constellation of the uncertain factors incorporated in the model.

Figures 1-3 show the probabilities of paths for the output gap, output growth and inflation generated by the
model over a period of 4 years (16 quarters) and where the central bank follows its optimally chosen policy
rule. I assume we start from a position roughly like the UK today. The figures for growth and inflation are
conceptually similar to the so-called fan charts showing the MPC’s best collective judgement about how
output and inflation might evolve. (For comparison with figures 2 and 3 the fan charts 2b and 3b are those
from the August 2014 Inflation Report). In producing those fan charts the MPC takes into account vastly
more information than in the stylised model used here. An important difference is that the fan charts in the
Inflation Report are constructed around a central forecast that is conditioned on a specific path for interest
rates whereas the paths in figures 1 and 2a and 3a take account of how interest rates would themselves vary
over time. That is one reason why the uncertainty around the most likely path for inflation is very much lower
in 3a, in which interest rates react to different inflation and output outcomes, than in chart 3b from the
Inflation Report showing inflation outcomes based on assuming that interest rates evolve in line with market
expectations at August 2014.

Figure 4 shows probability distributions for the path of Bank Rate . Along the central path (that is the median
where 50% of the outcomes are with lower interest rates and 50% have higher rates) the level of Bank Rate
rises gradually. But it remains materially below its pre-crisis average of around 5% even after four years.
Figure 4 also shows that things may turn out quite differently from the central path. This simple model
suggests that there is a 10% chance that the appropriate level of Bank Rate increases to above 5% within
th

18 months (the line labelled “90 percentile”). It also shows that there is a 10% chance that the appropriate
level of Bank Rate is around zero for two years to come and is only just over 1% even four years ahead (the
th

line labelled “10 percentile”).

In this simple model, which path for interest rates is taken among the wide swathe shown in figure 4 depends
on the values taken by the uncertain (random) parameters of the simple model. This is not meant to be a
precise guide to the possible variability in interest rates in the UK over the next four years. While the model
allows for some uncertainty about the quantitative relationships between key economic variables, it assumes
that these relationships take a specific form – linear in this case – and that they do not change over time.
The model also misses key aspects of the economic environment, such as the state of the banking sector,
demand for British exports, commodity prices, and the stance of fiscal policy. I also assume that the
9

I generate an appropriate path of Bank Rate for each realisation of the set of uncertain parameters. There are 1000 such realisations,
or scenarios, in all. Each path is that from following an optimal interest rate rule that is derived ex-ante of the realisations (and thus
takes into account the model uncertainties). In the context of this model, this path of Bank Rate could be interpreted as a composite of
Bank Rate and asset purchases.

economy is not hit by any unpredictable events during the forecast horizon – we just get a realisation of the
random factors (on initial slack, on the strength of interest rate effects and so on) and that determines how
the economy then evolves. But in reality there is a real chance that we experience substantial changes in
the prices of, for example, oil, financial assets, or exchange rates during this period, all of which can affect
inflation and output and none of which I take account of here. So in practice outcomes may even be more
variable than what is shown in the figures.

How does a policy of fixing the interest rate for a 3 or 4 year horizon look in the light of this model? Not very
attractive I should say. Suppose that interest rates are set at the outset so that they follow the central
(median) path. On average this is an appropriate policy – but in the light of how things actually evolve it
could be very different from the interest rate that would be appropriate based on what actually happens to
inflation and output. How wrong could it be? Well 4 years ahead the interest rate to which the central bank
commits at the outset if it fixes policy at what is (ex ante) the average outcome could, with about 10%
probability, be at least 2.5 percentage points too low and with 10% probability it could be at least
2 percentage points too high. Having interest rates that far from the right level, and for an extended period,
seems to me a very high price to pay for the certainty of following a given path for interest rates. It would
probably generate outcomes that were wildly unstable. In the Annex I show some specific examples of
unstable outcomes from following a fixed interest rate path. Indeed across a wide range of economic models
it is the case that outcomes can become completely unstable if the central bank does not vary the nominal
interest rate in response to economic developments.

Suppose instead that the central bank accepts that it must respond to events as they unfold. Suppose in fact
that the central bank calculates what the appropriate response is given the uncertainties and sees that the
fan chart for interest rates is as in Figure 4 (based of course on our highly simplified model). How might it
then give guidance on policy? A natural response might be to say it should just publish figure 4. I want to
consider some practical issues with that in a moment. But setting those to one side for now, let me consider
how you might describe in everyday language the message that figure 4 conveys. (And using everyday
language is absolutely central to effective communication. The amount of training and time needed to really
understand what figure 4 means is surprisingly large). One might try the following as guidance:

Interest rates are likely to rise gradually from their current exceptionally low point, but probably to a level that
is meaningfully short of the level of around 5% that used to be thought normal. But the exact path that
interest rates should follow cannot be known for certain since how the economy will evolve is not known in
advance. There is inevitably substantial uncertainty about the precise level of interest rates that will be
suitable in the future. So this guidance is more in the way of an expectation and certainly not a commitment.
I don’t think that is a bad summary – in everyday language – of what figure 4 shows. It is also pretty much
the message on policy that the MPC have been giving for some months.

Whether or not something more precise and quantified than this broad description is useful is the issue I
want to turn to next. Before that let me just say again that the figures above are based on a highly simplified
model and that the way it is calibrated is based on some fairly subjective, though I think reasonable,
judgements. For all that, I think the central conclusion that I draw from it – which is that setting interest rates
on a pre-committed path for several years ahead does not look like a very attractive strategy – is one we can
be confident about. The key point is that things can happen in the economy that are very different from our
current best guess, and that when they do, just leaving interest rates on an unchanged path is not sensible.
This is not just a theoretical point. The scale of unexpected shocks that hit the UK – the difference between
actual outcomes and prior best guesses – really is big. To illustrate, table 1 compares the annual GDP
growth rates in the first quarters of 2008, 2009, and 2010 with predictions made in the first quarter of 2007.
The Bank of England asked a group of private sector economists what they thought the likelihood was that
the annual growth rate of GDP would be smaller than -1%, between -1% and 0%, between 0% and 1%, and
so on, in the first quarter of 2008, 2009, and 2010. The probability distribution shows the average assessed
likelihoods across all answers.

All economists interviewed thought there was only a remote possibility of a recession as deep as the one that
subsequently occurred. On average people surveyed thought it 94% likely that growth in the year to
2009 Q2 would be above -1%. The outturn was for growth of -7%. Table 2 shows results for annual inflation
forecasts as of 2007 Q1. Economists believed that the likelihood that the actual inflation rates for 2009 Q1
would be 3% or higher was around 6% and for 2010 that there was only a 10% chance that inflation would
exceed 3%. In fact inflation was at 3% or more in both years. Two- and three-year ahead forecasts of
annual inflation made in 2011 were not much better, as Table 3 shows.

What happened to the exchange rate and to oil prices between Autumn 2007 and early 2009 was also very
far away from market expectations. This is illustrated in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

The implied chance that oil prices would fall in different ranges, derived from options prices , also suggest
that what subsequently happened was thought to be extremely unlikely. Figures 5 and 6 show the outturns
along with a probability distribution implied by option prices as they were in September 2007. Outcomes as
high as they were in September 2008, or as low as they were in March 2009, were each given less than a
3% probability.

Self-evidently uncertainty around the future economic environment is very significant. This is why the MPC
meets regularly to assess the latest developments and, if necessary, to adjust the stance of monetary policy.

The commitment to a particular interest rate path is very unlikely to be the answer to the question of where
on the spectrum of giving guidance on policy one should sit.
Yet people who ask what Bank Rate will be in a few years’ time are likely to be disappointed if all they are
told is that it might be not much different from today, but it could be around 5%, or somewhere between the
two, or maybe even outside that range.
So what is the right sort of information – the right sort of guidance – to give?

3. What does economics tell us?

As I noted above, in stylised models of the economy where the central bank and the general public have
exactly the same information about the structure of the economy – and make the same assessment of the
nature of uncertainty – then everyone can work out what the central bank will do in various circumstances so
long as the central bank explains what exactly the aim of policy is, including about how trade-offs between
goals are evaluated. The central bank could specify some reaction function – that is a description (or rule)
for how it would set interest rates depending on how the economy evolves. But in a model which assumes
perfectly rational, computationally proficient and equally informed people, they could work out for themselves
the rule the central bank would follow to best achieve its objectives. If one weakened that assumption on
common knowledge then providing a monetary policy reaction function can be a useful form of guidance.
But in practice the conclusion that the central bank needs to either simply be explicit about its aims or
provide a policy reaction function is not very helpful because it ignores several very significant real world
complications:
1. Central banks will have different information about the economy than other agents – not so much in terms
of having more raw data (though that will certainly be a factor) but more in terms of the scope to analyse it in
an institution that has a small army of people trained to interpret data
2. Central banks will use various models of the economy – all of them imperfect and none used as sole
guide to policy. The use of such models in setting policy is part science and quantifiable (in the sense that
an explicit policy rule could in principle be codified and shared) and part judgement – which is much more
difficult to codify in a useful way. Coming up with a reaction function that is a good approximation to the
actual decision making procedure and can also be understood is in practice very difficult. (This is made
more complicated if people on the policy Committee don’t all agree and if those people change over time).

3. Even if models could all be codified and some policy rules specified, then if they were to be even an
approximate guide to actual decisions they would probably be complicated. They might be of the form: “if X,
Y and Z happen, and none of A, B or C happen, then policy will be set according to the following (non-linear,

16

16

dynamic, regularly re-estimated) equation….” The number of people who could understand what that
11

means and find it useful may be very small; the scope to misinterpret it is large .

So what are some other options for giving useful guidance?

One is to provide an expected path for the policy rate (for example the median path shown in figure 4 above).
But without giving some idea about how likely it is that policy will be close to this path this may not be
particularly useful. While making clear there is uncertainty around those paths is simple, quantifying that
uncertainty is tricky. One might just draw on the volatility of past interest rates (around some previously
expected path) as a guide to uncertainty in the future. Or a stochastic simulation using a monetary policy
rule could be used to derive fan charts for the policy rate. The policy rule could be (an approximation) to an
optimal rule – which is one way to interpret figure 4 above. What figure 4 showed was the probability
distribution for the path of Bank Rate if the central bank were to follow a mechanically derived optimal rule
taking into account the uncertainty of the parameters. It is worth stepping back though to consider what is
needed to construct figure 4.

You need the following elements:

1. An assessment of all the random factors (or shocks) that can impinge on the economy and their
probabilities
2. A model of how those shocks then impact on the outcome you care about – inflation, growth, output
etc.
3. A model for how monetary policy affects those outcomes and can be used to offset the impact of
shocks
11

You may think this is an exaggerated statement about what a policy rule might look like. But consider the rule that the MPC adopted in
August 2013. This is how it was described:
The Committee intends at a minimum to maintain the current highly stimulative stance of monetary policy until economic slack has been
substantially reduced, provided this does not entail material risks to either price stability or to financial stability.
In particular, the MPC intends not to raise Bank Rate from its current level of 0.5% at least until the Labour Force Survey headline
measure of the unemployment rate has fallen to a threshold of 7%, subject to the conditions below.
The MPC stands ready to undertake further asset purchases while the unemployment rate remains above 7% if it judges that additional
monetary stimulus is warranted. But until the unemployment threshold is reached, and subject to the conditions below, the MPC intends
not to reduce the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves and, consistent with that, intends to
reinvest the cash flows associated with all maturing gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility.
The guidance linking Bank Rate and asset sales to the unemployment threshold would cease to hold if any of the following three
‘knockouts’ were breached:
 in the MPC’s view, it is more likely than not, that CPI inflation 18 to 24 months ahead will be 0.5 percentage points or
more above the 2% target;
 medium-term inflation expectations no longer remain sufficiently well anchored;
 the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial
stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of mitigating policy actions available to the FPC, the
Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in a way consistent with their objectives.
The Committee will continue to set the level of Bank Rate and the size of the asset purchase programme each month, taking these
criteria into account. The action taken by the MPC if any of these knockouts were breached would depend upon its assessment at the
time as to the appropriate setting of monetary policy in order to fulfil its remit to deliver price stability. There is therefore no presumption
that breaching any of these knockouts would lead to an immediate increase in Bank Rate or sale of assets.
This policy rule runs to 360 words.

4. An assessment of what the optimal policy response to such shocks is (which means using 1-3 above
to derive a policy rule that maximises some specified target function).
5. If policy is made by a committee you need to reach an agreement on 1-4; if it is a committee with
members responsible for their own votes you somehow need to reconcile a unique path of rates (for
given realisation of shocks) with individual accountability in an environment where people will take
different views on the structure of the economy, its current state and the chances of various shocks
hitting in the future.

This is a complex task. I could construct figure 4 but only with a very simplified and stylised model (which
ignored a vast amount of information that any policy committee should certainly take account of) and where I
chose the calibrations based on my own rather subjective assessment of the environment. For example I
chose to calibrate uncertainty about slack by saying it was somewhere in the 0-4% range and that all
outcomes in that range were equally likely. The MPC currently have a best collective view that slack is most
likely to be around 1% – a rather different assessment. And the model I used to construct figure 4 had only
four sources of uncertainty – in practice at MPC meetings we discuss many dozens of sources of
uncertainty.

The MPC could nonetheless decide to use a mechanical procedure that is some sort of rough approximation
to its decision making so as to produce a fan chart for interest rates. That might involve using a model with a
similar structure to that used to construct figure 4; it would have embedded in it a policy rule for setting
interest rates for any given state of the economy. This would be a (pretty crude) approximation to the
decision making process of any one member of a Committee. Whether the resulting probability distribution
of interest rates was a useful guide to the true chances of interest rates taking on different values is hard to
judge. Whether any resulting fan chart of interest rates would be an improvement over a rougher sort of
guidance – for example a statement that interest rates are expected to only increase gently from the current
level over the next few years – is also unclear.
There is no getting around the fact that constructing fan charts of interest rates that represent the MPC’s
view of the probability of different paths present many problems. It involves, for example, the quantification
of the chances of various events happening which may go beyond what can meaningfully be done. The
12

apparent precision of probability statements in a world of uncertainty (not just risk) can be misleading .

More useful can be the assessment of different scenarios and the use of model to (in a rather mechanical
way) find a path for interest rates which in that particular scenario delivers a path for output and inflation with
particular features. This gives an indication of the sort of policy response that might be appropriate in a
12

The distinction between uncertainty and risk is one that Knight and Keynes both made. In a famous passage Keynes described what
he meant by “uncertain knowledge”:
“By ‘uncertain’ knowledge, let me explain, I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The
game of roulette is not subject, in this sense, to uncertainty...The sense in which I am using the term is that in which the prospect of a
European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence...About these matters there is no scientific
basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know.” Keynes (1937).

specific eventuality. One possibility is something along the lines of the Riksbank’s ‘four-panel graphs’ as
illustrated in their February 2012 minutes (Sveriges Riksbank 2012), or the ‘three policy paths’ used by
Yellen (Yellen 2012). (See also Svensson (2013)).
So what do some of the world’s major central banks do today?

4. Communication strategies of other central banks

At the Bank of England the MPC does produce forecasts of inflation and GDP with assessments of the
probability of different paths over a 3 year horizon. These are conditional forecasts based on specific paths
for interest rates – so do not take account of the likely response of the MPC to different outcomes. And the
13

specific interest rate paths are not a view of the MPC or its most likely (or expected) future policy ; they are
either for a constant interest rate path or the prevailing market curve. These conditioning assumptions raise
well-known problems – well described by Woodford (2013).

The Fed provides different information. The members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) each
provide their central projection of the appropriate Federal Funds rate target at the end of each of the next
several years, as well as in the longer run. (These views are represented as individual points on a ‘dot
chart’). FOMC members also provide forecasts for key economic variables – such as output growth,
unemployment and inflation – based on their own individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
The range of dots in the FOMC’s ‘dot chart’ represents the range of committee members’ central projections
for interest rates. The FOMC’s dot chart may be useful at conveying the heterogeneity of views amongst its
participants; but by focusing on only central estimates, it does not reflect the uncertainty each policy-maker
attach to their own assessments.
It might seem clear that to condition forecasts on policymakers’ views on what would be their own future
monetary policy response is a better alternative than the Bank of England approach and that if risks around
that preferred path can be quantified it provides more useful information than the FOMC dot chart. In rather
different ways The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank, and the Riksbank attempt to do just
this. If the path of interest rates used is a reasonable approximation to the true expectation based on how
the Committee will actually make decisions in the future, then this would seem a better option than using a
market implied path for interest rates and would avoid some well-known problems of consistency and
interpretation.

There is still the issue of how to provide probability assessments of interest rates being away from the
“preferred” path. The Riksbank uses uncertainty bands based on historical forecast errors for implied

14

forward rates, which are adjusted to take into account the corresponding risk premium ; the Norges Bank
15

uses fans that depend in part on model-based density forecast and in part on judgment . For the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), the fan chart represents the uncertainty around the magnitude of the
main drivers of the economy. The RBNZ fans summarise the projected path of interest rate for a collection
16

of a thousand scenarios . (It is worthwhile noting that the RBNZ’s fan chart does not need to reflect the
heterogeneity in views across policy makers, because in New Zealand the Governor is personally
17

responsible for all the monetary policy decisions taken by the Bank .) There are different ways the future
paths and uncertainty bands around them can be generated, and there is no clear right way. The precise
way to generate these fan charts, and what type of uncertainty could, or should, be incorporated is likely to
continue to be the subject of research.

5. Guidance about the future path of policy in the UK

In different ways the MPC has for a long time provided guidance about the likely future path of policy in its
publications, in speeches, interviews and evidence at the Treasury Committee. Some guidance about the
future path of policy was provided in an indirect way. The Inflation Report has for many years contained
forecasts for GDP and inflation that are derived under the assumption that Bank Rate would follow the profile
implied by market rates. If inflation was then expected to rise above target, it was an (imperfect) indication
that many on the MPC believed it would probably have to raise rates above what was implied by market
rates. And vice versa, if inflation was expected to fall below target conditional on market interest rates.

This may seem to be a roundabout way of communicating the likely future path of interest rates. And as I
said earlier, there are known problems of internal consistency with the conditioning path assumption behind
those charts, summarised clearly in Woodford (2013). But in the years preceding the financial crisis, a
period that has been described as the great moderation, it seemed to most people that the fan charts gave
them a reasonable guide to what the MPC was up to and how policy might evolve. In large part this was
because the path of Bank Rate implied by market interest rates usually generated a fan chart for inflation
whose central path was close to the target and was fairly symmetric around it. And if market interest rates
deviated materially from what the MPC thought would appropriately reflect their likely future policy stance,
MPC members had plenty of opportunities in addition to producing fan charts to influence market
expectations: there has never been a shortage of MPC speeches and interviews.

August 2013 saw the introduction of more explicit guidance about policy. Monetary policy had gone through
a phase of exceptionally low interest rates and unprecedented asset purchases. With the economy starting
to pick up speed again, uncertainty about how the MPC would respond to signs of a gradual economic
recovery appeared particularly great. So it seemed to the MPC right to give more guidance than had been

given in the past. The combination of unprecedented shocks and exceptional policy meant that past actions
might not be giving much information about how policy might be set. For me there was one specific risk in
mid-2013. This was that at the emerging signs that the growth of GDP might be returning to levels that were
closer to the long run trend for the UK, people might assume that with inflation also fairly close to target that
monetary policy might quickly be returned to something that looked more normal. “Normal” might well be
thought of as a level for Bank Rate of around 5% (which is the average Bank Rate since 1694 and also the
average in the 10 year period between the formation of the MPC and the onset of the financial crisis – a
period when inflation was close to target and growth close to the long run average for the UK).
Now the MPC is giving some qualitative judgements on most likely outcomes – saying that interest rate rises
are expected to be gradual and probably to a level lower than had been seen as normal pre-crisis.

Is this guidance too vague and imprecise (more vague than is optimal)? Is it open to misinterpretation?

The MPC could try to give more information on how it will set policy; it could give some approximation to its
future reaction function. But I have argued that an easy to understand reaction function will likely be too
crude to accurately reflect how decisions will actually be made – so runs the risk of being more misleading
than informative. It is not self-evident that some approximation to a collective reaction function (even
ignoring such issues as different members having different reaction functions) is really helpful to ordinary
people in understanding what the prospects are for interest rates. It is very likely that any reaction function
the central bank gives will at best be a rough approximation; and the more precise you make it the more
people may see it as a rule which will absolutely be followed. This is one aspect of a broader problem with
guidance which is the danger that people confuse guidance with commitment.

The MPC has been at pains to stress that the guidance it gives is more an expectation than a promise. This
has been true since we provided the assessment of the uses of guidance in August 2013. And yet it has
been very common in the media to describe guidance in the language of promises (or time-contingent
guidance):

The risks of interpreting guidance meant to convey expectations as commitments is not just hypothetical.

6. Conclusions

In an ideal world (and in idealised models) the Central Bank can just explain its objectives; maybe it would
also need to describe its reaction function. No more is needed.
But unless outsiders have as good information on the economic outlook – and can plug that into the reaction
function – then they may be left floundering in attempting to assess the prospects for interest rates.

Any reasonable approximation to a reaction function might be very complex. (Indeed it is very likely that it
is; otherwise MPC meetings would be mechanical affairs lasting 5 minutes).

In light of this I believe that the central bank directly giving some assessment of the likelihood of interest
rates following different paths is likely to be helpful, particularly in situations in which past action and
communication is not enough to describe new trade-offs in an unusual environment.
Constructing an explicit probability distribution for the central bank’s own policy rate that is based on the
realities of how policy is made and gets across a message that can be widely understood is a major
challenge.

Attempting to provide a specific central path with fans around it is a complex task, and may go beyond what
is feasible and useful. Spurious accuracy is unhelpful. So while I am open minded about whether the MPC
should provide fan charts for interest rates, I am not convinced that is clearly a step forward.

20

Currently, it might be just as useful – and probably less misleading and possibly even more accurate – to
give forms of guidance which are more qualitative, such as: “interest rate rises will probably be gradual and
likely to be to a level below the old normal”.

That says something substantive; and most people can understand it.

20

As Gilboa has stressed a probabilistic approach is quite useful in illustrating a broad sense of subjective uncertainty, but can be
counter-productive if it forces the practitioner to impose an arbitrary degree of precision to that uncertainty. In a case where we want to
communicate that interest rates are likely to rise gradually whilst also emphasising there is a significant degree of uncertainty around
this expected path, a model based fan chart forces us to address the question: ‘Exactly how uncertain are you? By 1% or 2%?’ It can
be difficult to provide an answer without imposing some spurious level of precision. The reality is that not all types of uncertainty can be
meaningfully quantified. As Gilboa says: “The Bayesian approach is quite successful at representing knowledge, but rather poor when it
comes to representing ignorance. When I try to say, within the Bayesian language, ‘I do not know’, the model asks me, ‘How much do
you not know? Do you not know to degree 0.6 or to degree 0.7?’ ” Gilboa (2014).

Annex: The Model

The model presented below is reduced to the bare minimum. It has three parts, summarised in three
equations, which describe the evolution of output, inflation and supply capacity. We aim to describe the
economic environment – and crucially the uncertainty about it – in a way that is roughly consistent with the
assessment made by the MPC in its latest Inflation Report and which allows an explicit calculation of optimal
monetary policy.
1. The growth rate of output ( ̇
(

depends on the deviation of the real interest rate from its natural level

. The real interest rate is the nominal rate, set by the central bank and denoted ( ), minus

inflation ( ). (We assume that this dependence is linear but allow both the constant and the slope
coefficient to be uncertain.
̇

2. Inflation depends on the output gap via a Phillips curve. We constrain the constant such that
inflation remains at target when the output gap is zero.
(2)
stands for the output gap in the economy in quarter t-1, defined as output (
capacity (

relative to supply

.

3. The growth of the economy’s supply capacity is a weighted average of the mean growth rate of
output and its actual growth rate: above-average demand growth stimulates supply growth, and vice
versa. We allow the extent to which supply growth responds to output growth to be uncertain.

; this is close to the optimum that an unconditional minimisation

delivers.) We solve this minimisation problem numerically by computing the evolution of the economy over
50 quarters for each of 20000 different realisations of each random variable, and then taking averages over
the associated losses. We assume that the economy is not hit by any shocks. The endogenous variables
are uncertain only because the values of some parameters and of the initial output gap are uncertain.

Scenario analysis: Commitment vs rule-based policy making
In Figure A1 and A2 below I illustrate the economic outcomes that would prevail under specific scenarios if
the central bank were to commit to the median path of Bank Rates illustrated in Figure 4. This is contrasted
with the case where the central bank can respond in each period according to the mechanically derived
optimal policy rule, taking into account the uncertainty around the parameters.
