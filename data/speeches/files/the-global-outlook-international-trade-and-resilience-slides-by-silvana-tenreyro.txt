Outline
1. The Global Outlook
 Vaccine‐driven recovery.
 But divergence across countries:
 In economic outlook
 And in virus prevalence, and risks of further lockdown‐related disruption

2. The Globalization Question
 A Protectionist Narrative
 “Self‐reliance to build resilience”

 But concentration on domestic production can be a riskier strategy
2

1. The Global Outlook
 IMF and other forecasters have been revising up global GDP growth forecasts.

 Heterogeneous outlook partly due to differences in policy response.

1. The Global Outlook
 …and partly different
speeds of vaccine
rollout.
 Continued high virus
prevalence in many
countries.
 May lead to further
lockdowns, trade and
supply chain
disruption.

2. The Globalization Question:
How does openness to trade affect volatility?
 The Policy answer:
 Seems to assume “increase”

 Our research (Caselli, Koren, Lisicky and Tenreyro, 2020):
 Studies two key mechanisms
 Sectoral specialization
 Country‐wide diversification

 Quantifies change in volatility caused by trade

8

Specialisation Mechanism
 Trade induces specialization, increasing exposure to sectoral shocks
 Implications consistent with standard view
 Trade tends to increase volatility

 Caveat: not quite so! Which sectors the economy specialises in? Var‐
cov of sectoral and country shocks.

9

Diversification Mechanism
 Trade can act as a hedge against shocks
 Implications contrary to conventional view
 Allows firms and countries to diversify suppliers as well as buyers
 By diversifying sources of supply and demand, trade tends to reduce
volatility
 Allows countries to access technologies developed abroad to combat risks

10

Quantitative Results:
change in volatility
due to changes in
trade barriers from
the 1970

11

Takeaways from our research:
 Theoretical
 Trade increases or reduces volatility depending on the variance‐
covariance structure of all countries’ and sectors’ shocks.

 Quantitative
 increased openness contributed to a decline in volatitlity in 1970‐
2007 in most countries
 sectoral specialization channel generally small
 Heterogeneity: signs and quantities vary across countries
12

Implications for today
 Call for reshoring and de‐globalisation a risky strategy
 “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” (Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote, 1605)
 “Don’t trust all goods to one ship”
 If the goal is resilience and stability, diversifying suppliers remains a good strategy.

 Of course there might be other arguments
 Some argue: “Globalization increases the size of the pie, but leads to more inequality.”
 Economic theory: international trade is “Pareto‐improving” if there is a system of transfers
that can compensate those who lose (e.g. through re‐skilling).
 Often the “if” clause got lost.
 But de‐globalization not the solution: it will create new losers and winners, with a smaller pie.
