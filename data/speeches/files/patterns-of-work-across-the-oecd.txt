Abstract
Market work per person of working age differs widely across the OECD countries and
there have been some significant changes in the last forty years. How to explain this
pattern? Taxes are part of the story but much remains to be explained. If we include all the
elements of the social security systems like early retirement benefits, sickness and
disability benefits and unemployment benefits, then we can capture some aspects of
the overall pattern but still a lot remains unexplained. The story favoured by Alesina et al.
(CEPR DP.5140, 2005) is that the nexus of strong unions, generous welfare and social
democracy implies both high taxes and pressure in favour of work-sharing in response to
adverse shocks. This story, however, falls foul of the simple fact that most Scandinavian
countries now do much more work than the French and Germans despite having stronger
unions, more generous welfare, higher taxes and more social democracy. Ultimately, we
are forced into the position that there is no simple story. Some of the broad patterns can
be explained but there remain country specific factors which are hard to identify but lead to
substantial differences from one country to another.

1. Introduction
In the early 1970s in France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and the
United States (US), more or less the same proportion of the population of
working age were actually working (65-70 per cent). And, on average,
they were working roughly the same number of hours per year (18501950). By contrast, in Sweden, more people were working (74 per cent)
but much shorter hours per year on average (around 1650 in 1973). In
Italy, many fewer people were working (55 per cent) but about the same
average hours (1868 in 1970).
Three decades later some things have changed a lot, others very little. In
France and Germany, average employment rates have fallen a little and
average hours per year have fallen dramatically to just over 1400 hours.
In the UK employment rates are much the same but average annual hours
have fallen slowly but steadily to below 1700 hours. In the US, the
employment rate has risen a little and average annual hours have fallen a
little. Interestingly, US employees now work more hours per year, on
average, than employees in any of the rich countries of the OECD1. Little
has also changed in Sweden over the last thirty years, with the
employment rate remaining high and annual hours falling only very
slightly. Italy also still has an exceptionally low employment rate but
annual hours here have fallen a fair bit (to around 1600) but not to the
levels reached in France and Germany.
Overall, as we shall see, the picture with regard to market work is quite
complicated. Generally, the Scandinavians, along with the Dutch and
Swiss have the highest employment rates. The Americans, Australians

1

and Japanese work more hours per year than the rest. The Southern
Europeans (and the Belgians) generally have the lowest employment rates
but not the lowest annual hours which may be found in Denmark, France,
Germany, the Netherlands and Norway. Adding employment and hours
together, we find that Americans, Australians and New Zealanders are the
hardest workers, on average, and the French, Italians and Belgians work
least hard2. The hardest working countries work about 40 per cent more
than the least hard working.
The fact that this number is so large has instigated a significant body of
research which has often focused on why, in particular, Americans work
so much harder than the average European. An empirical overview may
be found in Nickell (1997) (Table 2 and Table 7, col. 3) and this suggests
that employment protection, taxes and unco-ordinated unions tend to be
associated with lower labour input. On top of this, there is a great deal of
empirical evidence on the determinants of overall employment rates
including Nicoletti and Scarpetta (2002) and Nickell et al. (2003). By
and large, they come to similar conclusions, namely that unions, taxes
and employment protection are associated with lower employment rates
but if union activity is co-ordinated, the impact of unions and taxes is
moderated.

Furthermore, there is some evidence that low levels of

competition in product markets is also associated with low employment
rates.
More recently, Prescott (2004) argued that taxes are the key, explaining
more or less all the variations in labour input across countries. Davis and
Henrekson (2004) also emphasise the importance of taxes. Both these
papers echo the results of Daveri and Tabellini (2000) who find that
labour taxes can explain most of the fluctuations in unemployment in
2

those countries which do not have co-ordinated pay bargaining. This
strong emphasis on the role of labour taxes has been criticised on the
grounds that it is inconsistent with the bulk of the cross-country evidence,
basically because of omitted variable bias (Nickell, 2003), or on the
grounds that it is inconsistent with the evidence on labour supply
elasticities (Alesina et al., 2005).
Alesina et al. (2005) then go on to note that labour inputs have fallen
especially in countries characterised by strong unions, extensive welfare,
high taxation and social democratic governments. As they remark “The
bottom line is that hours worked fell in countries that can be characterised
by the Continental European model and did not fall in the countries with
the American model (with Britain and Ireland in between)” (p.23). The
basic argument is that trade unions respond to adverse shocks by trying to
protect employees, pressing for work sharing as well as employment
protection more generally, which tends ultimately to reduce overall
labour input. This is reasonably plausible although the fact that Sweden,
the home of social democracy, strong unions and the welfare state, has
seen only very modest reductions in labour input over the last thirty years
gives pause for thought. Furthermore, Australia, where over 80% of
individuals still have their pay determined by union bargaining, has seen
little or no reduction in labour input. By contrast, in the UK, where both
union membership and coverage have collapsed since 1980, annual
working hours have fallen by 250 hours (14%) since 1973, whereas hours
in Sweden fell by a mere 79 over the same period.
In the light of this, it is perhaps worth pursuing the forces underlying
fluctuations in the volume of market work per capita a little further. In
the next section, we look at the current overall picture and how it divides
3

into annual hours and employment rates. We then look at the history of
both these, emphasising the huge variations across the different countries.
In Section 3, we focus on changes in the participation rates of different
sub-groups of the population, notably, prime-age men and women as well
as older men. We also consider overall unemployment rates. In Section
4, we analyse annual working hours, trying to explain the large
differences in the changes since the early 1970s. Finally, in Section 5, we
summarise our findings and provide a synthesis of the various
explanations of changes in labour input over the last thirty years.
2. The Overall Picture
In Table 1, we present a picture of labour input in 2002 in the richer
OECD countries, showing the division between employment rates and
hours. The big three countries of Continental Europe (France, Germany,
Italy) plus Belgium has the lowest input levels and many of the “AngloSaxon” economies plus Japan have the highest input levels. Denmark,
Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal and Finland tend towards the high input
end of the spectrum. Turning to the division between employment rates
and annual hours, significantly more people work in Denmark, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland than elsewhere. The big countries of Southern
Europe, Spain and Italy have many fewer people in work than the
remainder. Looking at annual hours, we see from column 3, annual hours
tend to be high in the Anglo-Saxon economies and particularly low in the
Netherlands and Norway with France and Germany on the low side.
In Table 2, we divide annual hours into hours per week and weeks per
year. An alternative picture, based on different data, may be found in the
Appendix. Broadly speaking, the outcome is much the same although
there are large differences for one or two countries. Hours per week vary
4

relatively little across countries except for the Netherlands which has by
far the highest number of part-timers. More interesting is weeks worked
per year, where there is much variation. Weeks not worked generally
consist of either of holidays and vacations or of absences due to sickness
or maternity leave. In practice, absences due to labour disputes, training
and so on are of minor significance. Looking first at vacations and
holidays, what stands out is that these are between two and four weeks
lower in the US than in any of the other countries. This is possibly due to
the differences in data sources, but it is also consistent with the fact that
many workers in the US only have one or two weeks paid vacation per
year, which would be illegal in nearly all OECD countries.
Unfortunately, we do not have comparable data for other non-European
countries but we do know that Australian workers, for example, have a
legal minimum of 5.8 weeks holiday and vacation time each year (see
Table 15, below).
Other absences are a residual and consist mainly of sickness or maternity
leave. There is a good deal of variation here which may, in part, be due
to measurement error. The data in two tables in the Appendix present
some alternative numbers which again show significant variations in
sickness and maternity leave.

These we investigate further below.

Overall, we see that annual holidays and vacations are much the same in
most countries with the notable exception of the United States. On top of
this there are wide variations in weeks of other absence, mainly sickness
and maternity leave.
Some History
Having seen how labour inputs vary across countries, it is worth looking
at how employment rates and annual hours worked have changed over the
5

last three or four decades. Starting with employment rates, a striking
feature of the numbers in Table 3 is that in the early 1970s, the pattern of
employment rates across countries was much the same as it is today. The
Scandinavian countries plus Switzerland have always had the highest
employment rates and still do. Spain, Italy and Belgium have always had
the lowest employment rates and still do. Some countries have seen
significant increases, most notably the Netherlands, with smaller
increases in Norway, Canada, New Zealand and the US.

In every

country, the employment rate of women has risen, by anything from 10 to
35 percentage points. Finland is the exception here, partly because it had
high rates of female participation even in the 1960s. Typically, therefore,
the employment rates of men have declined over the same period.
Finally, of course, these employment rates have been affected by the
dramatic fluctuations in unemployment in the 1970s to the early 1990s.
Underlying this relatively stable pattern are some significant changes in
the employment rates of a variety of different sub-groups which we shall
pursue below. Turning to the history of annual hours in Table 4, the
changes over the last three or four decades are much larger than the
changes in the employment rates. In 1970, in nearly all countries for
which data are available, annual hours were typically between 1850 and
1950. However, in Sweden and Norway, annual hours were already well
below this level despite a very buoyant demand for labour, with
unemployment rates in the two countries being 1.2 and 1.6 per cent,
respectively. By 2004, some countries had seen dramatic changes. In
France, Germany and the Netherlands, annual hours fell by around 500
from 1970 to 2004, in Norway and Japan, the fall was around 400 and in
Ireland and the UK the fall was close to 300. By contrast, in Sweden
Australia, Canada and the US, the fall over this same period was between
6

100 and 150. These differences are striking and we shall pursue them
further below.
In the next section we consider various components of the employment
rate.
3. Aspects of the Employment Rate
First, we can see in Table 5, how employment and inactivity rates differ
across both men and women and different age groups. We focus here on
the over 25s because we do not wish to pursue questions about
participation in education.
There are a number of interesting features of Table 5 which are worth
following up. First, while the employment rates of prime age men (2554) do not appear to vary very much, there are some quite striking
differences in inactivity rates for this group. Furthermore, the inactivity
rate now exceeds the unemployment rate in nearly every country.
Second, the inactivity rates of older men (55-64) differ significantly
across countries from Belgium, France, Italy and Austria where over half
of older men are inactive to Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and New
Zealand where less than one quarter are inactive. Third, inactivity rates
among prime age women are over 30 per cent in Ireland, Italy, Spain and
Japan and around 15 per cent in Scandinavia.

Interestingly enough,

inactive women are not specifically looking after children. Since the
1990s, the inactivity rates of women are inversely correlated with fertility
rates across countries. So in what follows, we focus on each of these
three issues, starting with inactivity among prime age men.
Inactivity among prime age men
7

The history of this aspect of labour input is set out in Table 6. Back in
the 1960s and early 1970s, prime age male inactivity rates rarely
exceeded 5% by any significant amount. By 2004, only two countries
have rates below 5%. Countries where prime age men have inactivity
rates exceeding 9% today include Finland, Norway, Sweden, UK,
Australia and the US. This is an odd group of countries because, by and
large, they are noted for their relatively high levels of labour input. Thus,
by contrast, France and Germany have particularly low levels of prime
age male inactivity and the EU average is only 7.6%. The evidence
which we have on this issue suggests that a significant proportion of these
inactive men are categorised as long-term sick or disabled (European
Labour Force Survey). Furthermore, we know that the rules governing
entry into the disability benefit system are crucial, because exit rates are
generally very low. In some countries, these rules were significantly
weakened in the last thirty five years, in others not. Thus in Bound and
Burkhauser (1999), Table 17 we find the following:
Disability transfer recipients per 100 workers
Age
US
Sweden
Germany (W)

15-44
1970
1.1
1.8
0.7

45-59
1995
3.9
3.2
0.6

1970
3.3
6.6
7.5

1995
10.3
15.1
8.7

So in the US and Sweden, the numbers more than double from 1970 to
1995 whereas in Germany they barely change. In the UK, they rise even
faster (see Faggio and Nickell, 2003).
Inactivity among older men

8

The history of inactivity among older men is presented in Table 7. Back
in the early 1970s, these inactivity rates rarely exceeded 25% with the
notable exception of Italy. The situation here was exceptional because at
that time Italian men were entitled to a generous public pension at age 60.
By the early 1990s, inactivity rates among older men exceeded 25% in all
countries except Japan and were above 45% in many Continental
European countries outside Scandinavia.

Why did this happen?

Basically, much of this change can be explained by the increase in
financial incentives to retire early. And, by and large, these incentives
were introduced to remove older workers from the labour force under the
mistaken belief that this reduction in effective labour supply would help
reduce high levels of unemployment.

For example, in 1979, Italy

introduced “unemployment pensions” at age 57+, if unemployment was
due to severe economic conditions or industrial reorganisation.

In

France, unemployment benefits were paid to those over 56 with no
requirements to seek work or retrain.
Blondal and Scarpetta (1998) present a detailed analysis of the incentive
issue and their panel data regressions reveal the importance of financial
incentives in determining early retirement. In the 1995 column in Table
7, we present, in parentheses, the estimated inactivity rates were pension
systems to be made actuarially neutral up to age 64. In many European
countries, this makes a substantial difference. Duval (2003) extends this
work and in Table 8, we report the implicit tax rates on those working
between 55 and 64 generated by the early retirement and pension
systems. Then, in Table 9, we show some of Duval’s regressions simply
to illustrate the importance of implicit tax rates in determining early
retirement. For example, an implicit tax rate at age 60 of 50 per cent will
generate a fall in participation of 8.5 per cent. In the parentheses after the
9

1999 column in Table 7, we show Duval’s estimates of the inactivity rate
were early retirement schemes to be removed and actuarial neutrality
introduced up to 64. Again, they show big effects for many countries
taking the inactivity rates back to 1970s levels. Interestingly, by 2004,
we can see that inactivity among older men has started to fall in a
significant number of countries, particularly those where early retirement
incentives have been reduced, notably Finland, Denmark and the
Netherlands.
Inactivity among prime age women
The overall picture is provided in Table 10 and this shows that there has
been a continuing fall in inactivity among prime age women in nearly
every country. But inactivity rates are still high in Ireland, Italy, Japan
and Spain. Indeed, far higher than in much of Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Furthermore, whereas in the 1970s, fertility was positively correlated
with inactivity across OECD countries, it is now negatively correlated.
So in the low inactivity countries, women not only work more, they also
have more children.
Much micro-econometric work and the cross-country analysis in OECD
(1990), Chapter 6 and Jaumotte (2003) suggest that marginal tax rates
may be important here. So in Table 11, we present the marginal rates
facing married women at zero hours and when they are earning 67% of
average earnings given their spouses are earning 100% of average
earnings.

Here, we see some significant cross-country variations,

particularly at zero hours. If, by some mechanism or other, married
women have their own tax allowance, their marginal rate at zero hours
will be zero. At the other extreme, their earnings may simply be added to
their husband’s for tax purposes, so their marginal rate will be the same
10

as their husband’s. It is plain that high marginal rates at zero hours
generate a strong disincentive to working a low number of hours per
week. Even at more normal hours, however, there are large variations in
marginal rates across countries.
The implications of these and other variables may be found in the panel
regressions explaining participation in Table 12. Marginal tax rates have
important effects, as might be expected, with 10 percentage point
increases in both the rates included in the regression reducing
participation rates by around 3 percentage points.

The strictness of

employment protection laws on regular employment has a significant
negative effect as does union density. Introducing measures of business
sector labour productivity and male unemployment in column 2 has little
impact on the key variables noted above. The negative impact of these
new variables is not easy to interpret because they are potentially
endogenous3. They are only introduced because they have been included
in other work (eg. OECD, 1990, Table 6.3 and Jaumotte, 2003, Table 5)
and it is worth checking that they do not change the key results. The
same argument applies to the inclusion of variables capturing public
expenditure on children and parental leave. These will also tend to be
endogenous but their inclusion has little impact on the marginal tax rate
and employment protection effects.

The impact of union density is,

however, eliminated.
Overall, marginal tax rates and employment protection seem to have
relatively robust negative effects. However, the time dummies in the
regression in column 1 reveal a background rise in female participation
by 14 percentage points and this is even bigger after we add in further
variables in column 3. The implication of this is that there are further
11

factors driving female participation which we are not able to capture.
Furthermore, looking at the trends in inactivity implicit in Table 10, it is
plain that there are large differences across countries. For example, there
are very significant differences in apparent preferences about part-time
work. This is important, because a willingness to work part-time clearly
helps in obtaining a job. In Table 13, we show the percentage of these
who work part-time and the percentage of these who do so voluntarily.
Thus in Finland and Spain, few women work part-time despite married
women facing zero marginal tax rates at zero hours. Furthermore, around
half of these do so “involuntarily”. By contrast, in the Netherlands, more
than half the working women are part-timers and the vast majority of
them wish to be so.
In summary, we can identify certain variables such as marginal tax rates
and employment protection, which impact on the participation rates of
prime age women. But explaining why the vast majority of prime age
women in Scandinavia were active in the labour market by the early
1970s when only a small minority were economically active in Italy and
the Netherlands, and why the changes in subsequent decades differ so
much, is not easy on the basis of standard economic variables. In all the
countries, there are a number of causally interacting trends among women
going at different speeds in different countries – rising education, falling
fertility, rising participation, rising expenditures on child care, rising
productivity, rising wages. Sorting out these interactions remains to be
done.
Overall unemployment rates
Since a great deal is known about the subject (see Nickell, 2003 or
Nickell et al., 2005 for example), we comment only briefly on overall
12

unemployment rates. In Table 14, we show the overall trends. The basic
picture is one where unemployment rose across the OECD from the
1960s to the early 1980s, peaking then or in the early 1990s before falling
back to 1970s levels in most countries or remaining stubbornly high in
some, notably the big four of continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy,
Spain). In 2004, around half of the European countries in our list had
lower unemployment than the United States, thereby emphasising that
only a part of Europe suffers from the slightly mythical “European
unemployment problem”.
To avoid high levels of unemployment, the following policies seem to
work.

First, a social security system which concentrates on placing

individuals in jobs. It is important that specific people in the employment
service are responsible for specific workless individuals.

Further,

employees of the employment service must be well trained and have the
correct incentives. They can employ a mixture of carrots and sticks. The
actual level of benefits is not particularly important. Second, having the
right sort of wage determination system. If there is a high level of
collective bargaining coverage, some degree of co-ordination of
bargaining is required. High coverage alongside low union membership
as well as decentralised and adversarial bargaining typically results in
high unemployment. Also helpful are relatively low labour taxes and the
absence of very strict employment protection legislation.

Finally, a

deregulated service sector helps to sustain a buoyant labour market when,
inevitably, manufacturing employment is on a downward trend.
This completes our discussion of the important factors determining
employment rates.

We next turn to hours worked per year by the

employed.
13

4. Annual Hours Worked by the Employed
Despite the huge variations in annual hours worked by the employed4
across the OECD, less is known about this than about employment rates.
As we have already seen in Table 4, except for Sweden and Norway
where female participation was very high, annual hours in 1970 were
between 1850 and 1950 in most countries for which data are available.
Since that time, annual hours have fallen by anything from 100 to 150 in
Sweden, Australia, Canada and the US to around 500 in France, Germany
and the Netherlands.
We have already noted that variations in annual hours are driven, in the
main, by holidays and paid vacations and by sickness and parental leave.
Looking over time, we see from Table 15 that in many countries there has
been a significant increase in the minimum annual paid leave governed by
legislation. In both Italy and the UK, there was no legislation until the
late 1990s when the European Working Time Directive (November 1993)
was incorporated into national legislation. By and large this made little
difference in practice because annual paid holiday typically exceeded four
weeks in Italy and even as far back as 1981, average annual weeks of
holiday for manual workers in the UK was 4.2 (see OECD, 1990, Table
6.1). Perhaps the most noteworthy point is that the US is unique among
the developed OECD countries in having no legal minimum to annual
paid leave.
Another contributory factor to changes in annual hours is the incidence of
part-time work. This is not, of course, an explanation of changes in
annual hours since it is merely one of the mechanisms by which the hours
which people choose to work are expressed. In Table 16, we see the
14

history of part-time employment. In many countries, there has been an
increase in part-time employment, but it remains below 20 per cent in
most countries.

The UK, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Japan and

Australia have a significant proportion of part-time employment, mainly
among women. Southern Europe generally has the lowest level of parttime work.
Turning to sickness and maternity leave, in Table 17 we present
information on the percentage of employees in receipt of publicly
provided sickness and maternity benefit. Interestingly, in many countries
we see that this percentage has fallen from 1980 to 1999. Then in Table
18, column 1, we convert this into average weeks of leave which we then
compare with some other measures.

These are reasonably closely

correlated although the fact that the average weeks in receipt of benefits
exceeds the absence measure provided by Alesina et al. (2005) for the US
suggests the latter is understated.

Nevertheless, there are significant

differences across countries in the amount of sickness/maternity absence
and, presumably, a significant proportion of those differentials is due to
the variations in the rules governing benefit payments.
So legislation on paid vacation leave and sickness/maternity benefits
obviously has some impact on working hours, but what about the
underlying forces at work, including those which drive the legislation?
In Table 19, we present some panel regressions. Looking first at the tax
variables, there is a positive impact on hours from the marginal rate
facing women on zero hours where their husband is working. This is
consistent with the fact that high marginal tax rates at zero hours
discourage low hours jobs. By contrast, the marginal rate facing married
15

women with working husbands earning two-thirds of the average wage
has a negative impact on hours as might be expected. The same applies
to the average tax wedge. However, the marginal tax rate facing a single
earner appears to have a small positive effect, although it is hardly robust.
Employment protection has, if anything, a negative impact on hours,
perhaps reflecting the fact that impressing managers with long hours is
less of a requirement if jobs are secure5. Despite this, union density
appears to have a robust positive impact on hours, consistent with the
results reported in Bowles and Park (2005), Table 1, Column I. This is,
however, inconsistent with the emphasis placed on the idea that trade
unions encourage shorter working hours by Alesina et al. (2005).
The strong positive role of earnings dispersion also confirms the results
of Bowles and Park (2005). In their view, this is strong evidence in
favour of the “Veblen hypothesis”.

The idea here, espoused in The

Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorsten Veblen (1934), is that
households consume goods not only for their own sake but to impress
their neighbours. This, of itself, will tend to raise working hours and if
earnings are more dispersed, additional work effort is required to make
the appropriate impression6. An alternative hypothesis, put forward by
Bell and Freeman (2001), is that increased earnings dispersion induces
longer hours because it raises the incentives to work harder in order to get
promoted and move up the earnings rankings. Whatever the driving
force, there does appear to be a strong effect of earnings dispersion on
working hours.
Earnings dispersion itself is, of course, influenced by labour market
institutions, even when the dispersion of skills is taken into account. For
16

example, Nickell (2004) reports a simple cross-country regression which
finds that the 90/10 earnings ratio is significantly negatively influenced
by union coverage even when controlling for skill dispersion captured by
the dispersion of test scores reported in the International Adult Literacy
Survey (OECD, 2000).

Koeniger et al. (2004), in a more extensive

analysis, find that both trade union density and employment protection
tend to reduce earnings dispersion and hence hours. This indirect effect
of union density via earnings dispersion is -0.167 which does not quite
offset the positive union density effect in column 2.
Overall, therefore, we find that various aspects of the tax system,
employment protection and union density impact on working hours.
Perhaps the only surprising result is that union density is positively
related to hours, even when taking account of its negative impact on
earnings dispersion.
5. Summary and Conclusions
The data we have been analysing are summarised in Table 20, where we
show the history of labour input in the OECD countries.

Before

discussing various stories, it is worth remarking at the outset that simply
comparing the US with “Europe” is a hopeless strategy because European
labour markets are highly diverse. A second point to bear in mind is that
large macroeconomic shocks have distorted the labour input series for
some countries in some periods.

Thus, in France, Germany, the

Netherlands, Spain and the UK, there were particularly adverse
macroeconomic shocks between 1973 and 1983. The same applies to
Finland and Sweden in the early 1990s.

By contrast, Ireland, the

Netherlands and Spain were subject to strong favourable shocks in the
1990s.
17

The first story which is frequently used to explain cross-country
variations in labour input is based on labour taxes, a recent example being
Prescott (2004). The evidence we possess indicates that taxes cannot be
the whole story. The tax story is inconsistent with the tax effects on
labour inputs generated by microeconometric studies (Alesina et al. 2005)
and those generated by cross-country studies (Nickell, 2003).

For

example, if we apply the tax data to the annual hours regressions in Table
19, we find that the contribution of tax changes to the changes in annual
hours from the early 1980s to the late 1990s is very small, probably less
than 10 per cent.
A second story would be in the same spirit as the tax story but adding in
all the other elements of the social security system including early
retirement benefits, sickness and disability benefits, unemployment
benefits and so on.

As we have seen, these are certainly good at

explaining the changes in some aspects of the labour input, notably
inactivity among men, both prime age and old, as well as a part of the
changes in unemployment and female participation. But shifts in annual
working hours are a major part of the story and here, while labour taxes
have a significant impact, they explain only little of the overall picture.
A third story is that favoured by Alesina et al. (2005) who argue that the
nexus of strong unions, generous welfare benefits and social democratic
governments imply both high taxes and direct pressure towards less work.
This latter is partly driven by work-sharing in response to adverse shocks
and partly by the not unreasonable belief that long holidays are a good
thing for workers, hence laws governing minimum levels of paid annual
leave. In practice, all developed OECD countries bar the US have such
18

laws, even those such as New Zealand and the UK where unionisation
has collapsed.

However, the work-sharing story applies clearly to

Germany and particularly France, where incentives to reduce labour
supply have consistently been applied in response to increases in
unemployment, culminating in the imposition of the 35-hour week in
France in the late 1990s.
However, it is hard to see how the same story applies to Sweden which
has stronger unions, more generous welfare benefits, higher taxes and
more social democratic governments than either France or Germany. Yet
it has one of the highest employment rates in the OECD and only a small
fall in labour input since the early 1970s. Thus, overall labour input in
Sweden was 3% below that in France and Germany (average) in 1970 and
26% above in 2004. Both Italy and the Netherlands also had only small
falls in labour input from 1973 to 2004, but for very different reasons. In
both countries, labour input in 1973 was exceptionally low. In Italy this
was because female participation was very low, with an employment rate
of around 30%. Furthermore, the retirement age was 60 for men and 55
for women, at least five years younger than in any other European
country. For example, it was 67 for both men and women in Denmark
and Sweden. So it is no surprise that in 1973 and, indeed, even in the
1960s, Italy had the lowest employment rate in the OECD. And it still
does. Add in only a modest fall in annual hours and we find only a small
fall in overall labour input. There is no strong element of work-sharing
here. Indeed, the Italian labour market model, with minimal welfare
benefits and very strong employment protection, places a great deal of
weight on the position of the male head of household, which is not to be
undermined either by the presence of a high earning wife or by the loss

19

of a job. Thus the unemployment rate of husbands at 2% was, in 1992,
among the lowest in the OECD (see OECD, 1994, Table 1.19).
While the labour input in the Netherlands was also exceptionally low in
1973, the subsequent history is completely different. The employment
rate of women in 1973 was extraordinarily low in the Netherlands at
28.6% but by 2004 it had risen to 65.7%. As a consequence the overall
employment rate had risen by 17 percentage points, by far the largest
increase in the OECD. But the majority of women in employment in the
Netherlands work part-time, so average annual hours fell dramatically.
The overall consequence of this was that the total labour input had barely
changed by 2004.
From all these different histories, it is clear that there is no simple story
which can explain what is going on. If we take groups of apparently
similar countries, even then we find considerable within group variations.
For example, in the “Anglo-Saxon” group, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, UK, US, all have a high level of labour input at present. Yet
while Australia and Canada continue to have a strong union presence and
Canadian labour taxes have risen significantly, their labour input has
risen whereas, in the UK, union membership has collapsed since the
1970s and labour taxes have not increased, yet labour input has fallen by
nearly 12% since 1973. Compared to this group, the Scandinavian group
Denmark, Finland, Sweden has, and always has had, very high
employment rates, very strong unions and very rapid increases in labour
taxes. Yet their labour inputs have not fallen rapidly and are still only
around 10 per cent lower than in the Anglo-Saxon group. By contrast,
the major countries of Continental Europe, France and Germany, where
unions are weaker and taxes have risen less rapidly, work-sharing

20

strategies have been embraced wholeheartedly and labour inputs have
fallen dramatically in the last thirty years.
The upshot of this is that there is no clear, simple story which will explain
the cross-country pattern of labour inputs over the last forty years. The
incentives embedded in the tax and social security systems of the
different countries are clearly important and explain many features of the
pattern. But they are far from being the whole story. Trade unions, and
indeed the population at large, have embraced work-sharing strategies in
response to adverse shocks in France and Germany. This has helped to
drive down annual working hours by around 500 since the early 1970s.
This liking for work-sharing strategies is not, however, shared in the
more corporatist societies of Denmark, Sweden and Finland perhaps
because they have a different view of how the economy works (see SaintPaul, 2004). Here the tax/legal framework is used to enhance work/life
balance, with very high labour force participation and relatively stable
annual hours, which have fallen little over the last thirty years despite
numerous adverse shocks.
Broadly speaking, we can discern three groups of countries, AngloSaxon, France/Germany, Scandinavia where there is some sort of
coherent story to be told about their pattern of labour input and the role of
taxes, benefits, unions and other labour market institutions. But further
countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, do not fit into any of these
three groups, and different explanations of their labour input patterns are
required. Overall, while it is plain that the tax/benefit system and unions
and other labour market institutions are important in explaining labour
input patterns across the OECD, other factors are involved which are not

21

easy to identify but lead to substantial differences from one country to
another.

? refers to a significant break in the series. a = 1983.
The figures in parentheses in the 1995 column refer to the estimated inactivity rate were the pension system to be made actuarially neutral up to age 64 (see Blondal and
Scarpetta, 1998, Table V.6.)
The figures in parentheses in the 1999 column refer to the estimated inactivity rate were early retirement schemes to be removed and actuarial neutrality to be introduced up
to 64. We use the average of low case and high case in Table 3 of Duval (2003).

AW = Average Wage. Computed using the tax rules of each country by looking a the
tax paid on an annual income for the wife of X and of X + 1 where X is 0% or 67%
of the average annual earnings of production workers, given the husband earns 100%
of the average annual earnings of production workers. Author’s calculations based on

Marginal tax rates: As in Table 11.
Average tax wedge: This is the average labour tax rate, the sum of the average payroll, income and consumption tax rates.
Computed by taking the average tax rates from OECD Taxing Wages Statistics including employers’ social security contributions
and adding the average consumption tax rate ((Indirect taxes – subsidies) ÷ consumption) from OECD National Accounts.
Employment protection: An Index referring to regular employment. Details of its computation are variable in OECD
Employment Outlook, 2004, Chapter 2. The numbers may be found in the first three columns of Table 2.A2.4.
Union density : ratio of employed union members to employees. See Nickell et al. 2005, p. 23.
Business sector labour productivity : output (in constant US dollars) per worker in the business sector. OECD male
unemployment rate : OECD Labour Market Statistics.
Real expenditure on cash benefits: Annual public expenditure in real dollars on family cash benefits per child age 0-14 times 10-3.
Real expenditure on parental leave: Annual public expenditure in real dollars on maternity and parental leave per child aged 0-3
times 10-3.
Real expenditure on family services: Annual public expenditure in real dollars on family services per child aged 0-14 time 10-3.
These final three variables were most kindly provided by Sakiko Tanaka. (See Tanaka, 2005)

Notes
As far as possible, these numbers correspond to the OECD standardised rates and confirm to the ILO definition. The exception here is Italy
where we use the US Bureau of Labour Statistics “unemployment rates on US concepts”. In particular we use the correction to the OECD
standardised rates made by the Bureau prior to 1993. This generates a rate which is 1.6 percentage points below the OECD standardised rate
after 1993. The rates referred to in Spain* refer to recently revised ILO rates. For earlier years we use the data reported in Layard et al. (1991)).
For later years we use the OECD Employment Outlook (2005, Table A).

In this table, the survey data on sickness and maternity are doubled. This is an adjustment
suggested by OECD staff. In our view, some of these numbers seem implausible.

Footnotes
1. Thus, they work more hours per year, on average, than workers in any other OECD country
aside from the Czech Republic, Greece, Mexico, Poland, the Slovak Republic (OECD, 2005,
Table F). However US annual hours are of the same order of magnitude as those in
Australia and New Zealand.
2. This, of course, refers only to market work. It is sometimes argued that a great deal of
market activity in some countries is replicated by non-market activities in others, partly for
tax reasons. For example, far more time in Germany is spent on food preparation in the
home than in the US, where a far higher proportion of food expenditure is in restaurants (see
Freeman and Schettkat, 2001). However, the data reported in Alesina et al. (2005), Table
17, indicates that the Germans spend much less time in the home on child care and
housework than Americans and that they spend more or less equal amounts of time on
leisure activities.
3. Labour productivity may be affected by changes in female participation, and unemployment
rates may easily be influenced by omitted factors which also affect participation.
4. Annual hours refers to the hours worked in a year by workers who work for the whole year
(or full year equivalent workers). They may work part-time, however. Also, it refers to
hours actually worked, not hours paid for.
5. Perhaps because, if jobs are secure, unauthorised absence is less likely to be punished by job
loss.
6. Bowles and Park (2005) provide a formal model of this effect.
7. In Koeniger (2004), Table 3, columns (5), (6), we find the coefficient on union density is 0.32 in the 90/50 equation and -0.13 in the 50/10 equation. So the total effect of union
density Table 19, column 2 is 0.21 – (0.32 x 0.22 + 0.13 x 0.70) = 0.21 – 0.16 = 0.05.
