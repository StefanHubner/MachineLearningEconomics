I am delighted to be here in Edinburgh this evening, and to have the opportunity to deliver the
twelfth RBS Scottish Economics Society Annual Lecture. Scotland has a strong tradition in
economics, which I am pleased to say that the Bank of England is recognising by featuring
Adam Smith on the new £20 note launched this week. You also have a thriving financial
services industry, with Edinburgh now among the leading financial centres in Europe.

Indeed, the financial services sector has recently become the fastest growing part of the
Scottish economy, with output and employment up by over 30% during the first half of this
decade. It contributes a higher percentage of GDP to the Scottish economy than in any other
part of the United Kingdom outside of London and the South-East of England.

Banking and fund management form the core of this dynamic financial success story. And
underpinning both of these activities is the need for individuals to find a safe and secure home
for their savings and for companies to access funds for investment. So this evening I want to
look at some significant changes in the pattern of savings – both in the UK and globally – and
to discuss their implications for the management of our economy.

My talk will be divided into three main parts. First, I will look at the role that savings play in
the modern economy. Second, I will review the implications of some of the changing trends
we have seen over the last decade – a falling UK personal savings rate, a rising company
savings rate in many countries, and growing imbalances between savings and investment
across the global economy. And I will conclude by discussing what these developments
might mean for the judgements made by the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee.

The role of savings
Saving occurs when income is not consumed immediately and is set aside for future needs.1
But why do people save? And what role does saving play in the economy?
Economic literature lists eight or nine potential reasons for saving2, but most of the savings
behaviour of UK households can be explained under three broad headings. First, individuals
1

Different concepts of income and consumption can therefore generate different measures of saving. In this
speech, the definitions used are those published in the UK National Accounts and conventionally used for
macroeconomic analysis.
2
Keynes (1936) set out a list of eight motives for saving. A review by Browning and Lusadi (1996) concluded
that Keynes’ list was comprehensive, but added one more – the “downpayment” motive.

generally wish to smooth consumption over their lifetimes. We benefit from our parents’
savings when we are young, and then accumulate assets over our working lives to provide
income when we are older. As a result, the savings behaviour of societies should be expected
to change as their demographic profile shifts – for example due to an ageing population.

Second, we accumulate money to undertake major purchases and to pay off the debts we have
incurred to make them. In the UK, house purchase is a major factor here. Individuals initially
accumulate savings to put down a deposit on a house – and through their working lives they
pay off the debt secured on it. Reducing debt is an important form of saving, as well as
accumulating financial assets. Both require income to exceed current consumption and hence
generate a financial surplus.

Third, individuals may want to build up a financial buffer to cushion fluctuations in income,
to cover unanticipated expenditures or to be more financially independent. Individuals will
tend to smooth their income and expenditure not just over their life cycle but over shorter
periods too.

Temporary changes in income and wealth are therefore likely to lead to

fluctuations in saving, whereas a permanent shift in income or wealth should lead to higher
consumption, leaving saving relatively unaffected.

Over time, saving leads to an accumulated stock of assets – and Chart 1 shows the latest
position for UK households, alongside the comparable picture a decade ago. Life assurance
3

and pension funds – primarily geared towards providing income in retirement – account for
about a third of total UK personal wealth. Another 40% or so is currently accounted for by
housing equity. And the remaining quarter is made up of cash, bank and building society
deposits (net of borrowing), stocks and shares and other financial assets.

Chart 1 also shows that the net wealth of the personal sector has more than doubled since
1995 – from £2.7 trillion to nearly £6 trillions – about seven times personal disposable
income. Over 80% of this increase reflects rising asset values – particularly in the housing
market.3 Housing wealth is now a much more significant component of the personal sector
balance sheet than it was a decade ago, though as I will discuss later it may have different
economic effects to the accumulation of financial wealth.

Savings and investment

From a personal perspective, saving allows financial planning and provides security. In the
national economy, it provides a key role in supporting capital investment. Investment is an
important influence on both the demand side and the supply side of the economy. On the
demand side, it is one of the more variable components of expenditure, with swings in
investment contributing significantly to fluctuations in the economic cycle. On the supply
side, investment in business assets and infrastructure boosts the productive potential of the
economy, supporting rising productivity and living standards.

The saving which supports business and public infrastructure investment is not all generated
in the personal sector.

Companies also contribute savings by retaining profits and

government can generate savings by running a surplus of tax receipts over current
expenditure. The national savings effort is a product of the contribution of all three sectors.

Davey (2001) shows that estimated capital gains on housing and financial assets have been large relative to
savings flows.

Chart 2 shows the large fluctuations we have seen in these sectoral savings rates over the last
four decades – though these shifts can often be offsetting.4 The recent trend has been for the
public sector to make a fairly neutral contribution to national saving – with modest
fluctuations accounted for by the cycle. Within the private sector, personal savings have been
on a declining trend over the last decade. But this has been offset by rising corporate saving.

Companies save money on behalf of shareholders, who are ultimately private individuals or
funds acting on their behalf. They are content to allow their wealth to accumulate within the
corporate sector because of the equity which is generated by profitable investment.
Corporate saving also provides a financial buffer to cushion shocks to demand and costs –
such as the recent surge in energy prices. Again, it is in the interest of shareholders for this
buffer to exist, rather than for these shocks to threaten the viability of the companies they
own.

4

Measurement issues may also contribute to these fluctuations. Saving is measured as a residual between income
and expenditure, increasing the potential for measurement error.

finance company investment and I will come back to this issue later.

Changing pattern of UK personal savings

Having sketched out the savings landscape, I now want to talk about some of the changes we
have seen within it – starting with UK personal savings.

Personal saving is the difference between household income and consumption. It reflects a
complex and very diverse set of decisions, with consumers of different ages at different points
in their life cycle. What we observe across the economy as a whole is the net result of these
decisions, taking into account borrowing as well as the acquisition of assets. Chart 4 shows
that personal saving peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s – though the high savings rates
of that period were partly driven by the need to offset high inflation.5 More recently, this
balance has declined from about 12% of personal disposable income in the early 1990s to
about 5% of income at present.

Changes in consumption behaviour associated with movements in the savings ratio can have
important macroeconomic consequences. Strong consumer spending and a declining personal
savings ratio helped to fuel the late 1980s boom, while the correction which followed in the
early 1990s helped to tip the economy into recession. The slowdown in the UK economy in
2005 and its subsequent pick-up last year were also associated with swings in the personal
savings ratio.

I mentioned earlier that changes in savings behaviour can reflect borrowing and the
repayment of debt, as well as the accumulation of financial assets. When we look behind
these changes in the UK savings ratio, we see that shifts in borrowing have been a very
significant factor.

5

Inflation-adjusted, the current level of the personal savings ratio is much closer to its historical average. The
impact of inflation on savings was highlighted in the late 1970s by Taylor and Threadgold (1979). For a more
recent discussion, see Davey (2001).

Chart 5 decomposes the change in the savings ratio into two elements. On one side of the
account is the accumulation of physical and financial assets by households in the form of
bank deposits, contributions to pensions and life assurance, and physical investment, mostly
in housing. On the other side is the accumulation of financial liabilities, which reflects new
borrowing offset by the repayment of existing debt.

Borrowing secured against house

purchase is the dominant element on this side of the equation. The savings ratio is the
combined effect of both these flows – the net amount that households save once account is
taken of their additional borrowing.

The chart shows that both the asset and liability sides of the savings equation expanded
significantly in the late 1990s and the early part of this decade. However, new borrowing has
grown more rapidly than the accumulation of assets – pushing down the overall savings
balance until it recovered somewhat in 2005. Changes in borrowing have dominated the
movements in the personal savings ratio over the last two decades at least, though as we saw
earlier rising asset values have offset increased borrowing and personal wealth has increased.

There is something of a paradox here. When the personal savings ratio was at its highest in
the early to mid 1990s, the acquisition of conventional savings vehicles by the personal sector
was relatively low.

By contrast, the recent high acquisition of financial assets has

accompanied a low savings ratio!

This paradox is partly due to the fact that borrowers and savers are different people, and that
while some households have been increasing their debts, others have been accumulating
assets.6 It also reflects the money multiplier at work – new money lent for house purchase
flows back into personal sector accounts and builds up the deposits of banks and building
societies. When personal sector borrowing and deposits are both rising rapidly, therefore,
there is also likely to be strong growth of broad measures of the money supply – which is
something we have also observed over much of the last decade.

As Chart 6 shows, these more liquid assets are the main swing factor on the asset side of the
equation for personal savings. Contributions to life assurance and pension funds are much
more stable – though these have been boosted recently by the need for some companies to top
up their pension funds.7

Consumption and the housing market

Saving decisions are the mirror image of the decision to consume; if I decide to save more I
consume less, and vice versa. So it is not surprising that the fall in the personal savings ratio
we have observed over the last decade has been associated with strong consumption growth.

Chart 7 shows that the ten years from 1995 to 2005 saw consumption growth of 3.5% per
annum. This has been the strongest period of consumer spending growth over the post-war
period, considerably above the historical average of 2.6% growth.8 Some previous periods of
strong consumer spending growth, such as the late 1980s, were associated with a significant
pick-up in inflationary pressures. So why has that not happened this time round?

A number of factors have helped to prevent the strong consumer growth of the last decade
spilling over into inflation. In the late 1990s, the economy took up slack in the labour market,
as the unemployment rate was considerably above its long-run equilibrium rate in the mid1990s. In the first half of this decade, the relative weakness of other components of demand
growth – investment and exports – helped to offset robust consumer spending. Throughout
the period, competitive pressures from global markets and a relatively strong exchange rate
have helped to contain inflationary pressures by holding down import prices.

Recently, we have seen some of these pressures becoming less helpful in containing demand
and price pressures – with stronger global markets and a recovery in investment boosting
demand and more imported inflation coming through from high oil and commodity prices.
Looking ahead, therefore, it is likely that more subdued growth in consumer spending will be
required to keep inflation in check, at least for a while.

8

The average growth rate prior to 1995 was 2.4%.

10

Another striking feature of the period of strong consumption growth we have seen over the
past decade is that it has been associated with strongly rising house prices. This has led many
people to see the housing market as a key driver of consumption and personal savings
decisions.

As Chart 8 shows, there is clearly an association between house price inflation and consumer
spending growth, but it is quite a loose and variable one. Recent house price inflation has not
been as strongly correlated with consumption as in the late 1980s, and consumer spending
recovered in the early 1990s against the background of a subdued housing market.

Economic theory suggests that if there is a permanent rise in personal wealth, then
consumption should also increase. But housing has different properties to other assets – as
higher house prices also raise the cost of housing at the same time as wealth is increasing.
When house prices rise, people trading up in the housing market are potentially worse off. By
contrast, those trading down are better off – and in net terms theses effects should balance.
So it is not clear that the wealth effect can properly explain the relationship on this slide.

A more likely explanation is that the housing market and consumer behaviour are affected by
common economic influences – in particular confidence about future income growth and the
level of interest rates.9 When this confidence is strong and or interest rates are low, both
9

See Barker (2005) for a discussion of the impact of low real interest rates on the housing market.

11

consumer expenditure and housing demand will be affected – pushing up house prices. There
may also be spillovers into consumption from lending for house purchase and mortgage
equity withdrawal.10 Because of these linkages, it makes sense to monitor housing market
developments to help understand how changing economic conditions are affecting household
consumption behaviour – even though there may be no hard and fast causal link.

Corporate savings and investment

I mentioned earlier that personal savings are only part of the overall savings picture. Retained
income by companies allows their shareholders to save indirectly by building up equity and a
large part of business investment is normally financed from the retained earnings of
companies – corporate saving.

It is not only in the UK that companies are now saving more than they need to finance
investment. Chart 9 shows that this is happening across our peer group of industrialised
economies as well. According to the IMF, saving by companies from their operations in the
G7 countries exceeded the amount needed to finance business investment in these countries
by $1.3 trillion in 2003 and 2004.

10

See Benito et al (2006) for a fuller discussion of the linkages between house prices and consumer spending

12

A number of explanations have been put forward for this excess corporate saving.11 It might
be a transitional phenomenon, as companies adjust to a world of lower interest rates, lower
corporate taxes and falling capital goods prices. Other explanations are linked to the impact
of globalisation on company strategy. Companies are choosing to buy existing assets in new
markets rather than investing in new assets in their existing markets.

Another line of explanation focuses on the fact that major companies appear to have increased
their desired cash holdings and have deliberately paid down debt to increase their ability to
withstand shocks. This behaviour might seem rather puzzling when the last decade has also
been described as the “Great Stability”, a period of steady growth and low and stable
inflation. However, evidence from both the US and the UK shows that while this is true at the
macro level, at the micro level firms and industries have experienced more volatility over the
last decade – as they have had to cope with an increasingly competitive global business
climate and the shocks we have seen have affected firms and industries very differently.12
This certainly rings true with me, given my recent background in the airline industry, which
has seen unprecedented volatility from the global shocks over the last decade.

With these many different explanations, it is unclear whether the shift to excess corporate
savings across a range of different countries will be sustained, or whether companies will
expand their investment expenditure to absorb higher saving. This may already be happening
as there are clear signs of a recovery in business investment in the UK – with official
statistics, business surveys and the Bank of England agents’ reports all pointing to
strengthening capital spending by firms. Business investment also appears strong elsewhere
in Europe and in Asia, and this would also be consistent with the healthy global demand
conditions we see at present.

Such a recovery of investment should be welcome – adding to productive capacity and hence
supporting rising living standards over the longer term. But if there is not some compensating
reduction in other components of demand, there are inflationary risks in the short term –
particularly against the background of a strong global economy. This reinforces the view that
we may need to see more subdued growth of consumption (public or private) relative to the
last decade, to allow a rebalancing of the economy.

See Parker (2006) and Comin and Mulani (2004) for recent empirical studies suggesting that despite recent
macroeconomic stability, firm level uncertainty may have increased.

Shifting pattern of global savings

Alongside the changing patterns of personal and corporate savings I have discussed so far, we
have also seen significant shifts in the global savings picture.

Like the UK, Chart 10 shows that the global savings rate has been on a declining trend in
recent decades, with some cyclical fluctuations. The global savings rate as a share of GDP is
about five percentage points above the UK, which probably reflects a combination of
demographic factors and our better developed financial system – which allows more
borrowing to finance consumption.

Global savings – including the contribution of companies and governments as well as
personal savings – totalled $9.7 trillion in 2005 and Chart 11 shows the geographical sources
of that savings pool. The most striking fact is that China contributes 11% of the total – about
two-thirds of the share of the United States, which is a much richer country. Though China’s
GDP is about 15% of the US total at market exchange rates, her high savings rate – around
50% of GDP – allows her to punch significantly above her weight in the savings world.

The rise of China as a global savings power has happened over the last two decades and, as
Chart 12 shows, it has been accompanied by a broadly equivalent decline in the US share of
global savings. Recent growth in Chinese savings has been mainly generated by rising
company and government savings. The savings shares of other regions have seen much
smaller swings, though other emerging Asian countries and the Middle East are also now
generating a bigger share of global savings than two decades ago.

Chart 13 shows that these shifts in savings patterns have been reflected in growing current
account surpluses and deficits across the global economy, which are the counterpart of
savings and investment imbalances. As financial markets are liberalised and become more
international, it is not surprising to see such imbalances emerge – as investment is no longer
constrained by domestic saving and companies and individuals have better access to overseas
sources of funds. However, the biggest imbalances suggest a flow of capital from Asia and
other emerging markets to the United States - totally in the opposite direction to which we
might expect. Countries like China with abundant labour supplies and good investment
opportunities might be expected to attract capital from rich countries such as the United States
with a high stock of savings, but in fact capital is currently flowing in the reverse direction!

A number of explanations have emerged to explain this somewhat counter-intuitive
situation.13

One view emphasises the role of risk-averse Asian investors looking for a safe

home for their savings and not finding them in their domestic markets. Ben Bernanke, the US
Federal Reserve Chairman, has argued that this creates a global savings glut and can also help
to explain also why long-term interest rates are so low across the developed world. A more
straightforward explanation would be that personal consumption is held down in China by an
under-developed financial system, the absence of a developed social security system and an

13

See IMF (2005) for a review of these explanations. Bernanke (2005) argues that there is a “global savings
glut” and Caballero (2006) that there is a shortage of suitable assets for investors. See also the contributions of
Obtsfeld and Rogoff (2005) and Miller and Zhang (2006).

artificially low exchange rate, which discourages consumption of imports. At the same time,
demand in the US has been strongly supported by loose monetary policy in the early part of
this decade – depressing the US savings rate.
These views are not mutually contradictory and both may help to account for the significant
current account imbalances which have emerged. Perhaps of more significance is whether an
unwinding of these imbalances – if it occurs – is gradual and orderly or disorderly and
associated with financial market turbulence. Indeed, worries about a disorderly unwinding of
global imbalances may be adding to the recent volatility we have seen in world financial
markets.

So far, there is optimism among the international institutions that an orderly unwinding can be
achieved – though this may need to be associated with continued dollar weakness and slower
US growth, as households there readjust to a more normal level of interest rates. And as long
as European and Asian demand remain healthy, a period of more steady US growth should
not be too disruptive to UK export and growth prospects.

Implications for monetary policy

So what are the implications of all this for monetary policy in the UK? The objective of the
Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England is to keep consumer price inflation on
target at 2%. Over the second half of last year, the inflation rate began to drift upwards away
from that target, against the background of strengthening demand at home and abroad. The
Committee has taken action with a series of interest rate rises help to keep demand pressures
in check and to help ensure inflation returns to target in the future.

This chart shows the assessment from our latest Inflation Report on how this might happen –
based on the prevailing market expectation of interest rates. The deeper red swathe highlights
our central forecast, but the wide fan around it indicates our range of uncertainty. The main
factor expected to help bring inflation back down in the short term is the downward impact of
energy prices after significant rises in previous years. If these reductions prove more dramatic
than our central projection has assumed, they could push inflation significantly below target.
On the other hand, the growth of demand could lead to more general upward pressures on
wages and prices, offsetting energy price reductions. That creates a risk that inflation remains
above target for longer into the medium term. The judgements of the Monetary Policy
Committee on the level of interest rates will depend significantly on how new evidence
affects our assessment of this balance of risks.

My discussion today of savings trends is particularly relevant to the demand side of this
equation and has highlighted a number of key issues. First, consumers’ expenditure has
grown strongly over the last decade, supported by a fall in the personal savings ratio and
strong asset price growth.

The conditions which ensured that such strong consumption

growth was compatible with low inflation may not be sustained into the future. Global
conditions may not be so benign, and unemployment is now much closer to its equilibrium
rate than it was in the mid-1990s when the period of strong consumer growth started –
increasing the risk of wage inflation. The sustainable growth of consumer spending going

18

forward is therefore likely to be closer to the historical average of around 2½ percent growth
and lower than the recent trend of 3½ per cent.

Second, companies have been repairing their balance sheets in recent years and are now in a
much stronger position to support higher business investment. This is already being reflected
in stronger investment spending in the UK, other European countries and in Asia.

A

continued surge in capital investment would require some further restraint in other
components of demand – notably consumer spending – if it is to be compatible with low
inflation.

Finally, there are risks attached to the emergence of significant global imbalances. In the
short-term the flow of savings from Asia and other emerging markets appears to have
supported the growth in asset values in the US and other western economies, as investors have
sought out save havens in more stable economies. This asset price inflation has probably
helped to support the relatively strong global demand that we have seen over the past few
years – and monetary policy needs to take that into account. However, perhaps a bigger
worry for the future is a disorderly unwinding of these imbalances, and while this risk exists,
we may see periodic bouts of financial market nervousness.

As we discovered in the Asian crisis in the late 1990s, the unwinding of current account
imbalances can cause considerable financial turbulence and adversely affect demand
prospects – and policy-makers need to respond appropriately if such conditions emerge.
However, the appropriate response of monetary policy depends on the prevailing demand
conditions. There is also the risk of repeating the mistakes of 1987, when loosening of
monetary policy in response to falling stock markets was overdone and provided a further
boost to the late-1980s demand-led boom.

A common theme to the developments I have discussed today is the need for a rebalancing of
the sources of demand growth – at home and abroad. At home, more subdued consumption
growth needs to accompany a recovery in investment if demand pressures overall are to be
kept in check. Meanwhile growth in the global economy needs to become less dependent on
the US consumer, and more strongly supported by demand growth from Europe and Asia.
Both at home and abroad, there are encouraging signs that an orderly rebalancing of this sort
can occur. But unexpected shocks may also emerge. The Monetary Policy Committee needs
19

to be prepared to respond to both scenarios, with the objective of keeping the UK economy on
track to meet the inflation target over the medium term.
