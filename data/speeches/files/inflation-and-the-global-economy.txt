Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

Had I been speaking here a year ago on the challenges faced by the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC), I would have emphasised the inflationary implications of the robust expansion in the UK
economy in the face of mounting capacity pressures and some signs of a pick up in global
inflationary pressure. You will recall that April 2007 was the month in which, for the first time,
the Governor of the Bank of England was obliged, under the accountability arrangements put in
place by the 1997 framework, to write an open letter to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Gordon Brown, explaining why inflation had risen to 3.1% in March, more than one percentage
point away from the target of 2%. That letter underlined the determination of the MPC to take
whatever action would be necessary to return inflation to target. It also explained why the MPC
expected that inflation would fall back towards target as increases in domestic energy prices, in
particular, dropped out of the base of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This expectation was
realized with inflation dipping a little below the target at 1.9% in July of last year.

While the first open letter after a decade of the post-independence period attracted a good deal of
attention, it is important to look at the period since writing the letter in a wider context. Looking
back, there is little to suggest that this period of above target inflation led to second-round effects
in wages and prices that could constitute the beginning of an inflationary spiral away from the
target. Nonetheless, measures of inflation expectations, especially from surveys and pricing
intentions in surveys of businesses have remained elevated since that time.

The main headline event since that period is, of course, the financial market disruption that
began last August and remains with us today. The far-reaching implications of this are still
being studied. Managing its consequences presents a significant challenge to policy-makers
around the world as its effects filter through to businesses outside the financial sector and to
households, not least in the latter’s access to mortgage finance. This has created a rather
different context for monetary policy compared to a year ago when the inflationary pressures that
led to the open letter were accompanied by a robust picture for economic activity.

However, in common with a year ago, the challenge of responding to inflationary pressures
remains. Prior to the publication of the February 2008 Inflation Report, I was struck how the
focus on the financial market turmoil had largely deflected attention away from concerns about
inflation. The MPC’s remit is to maintain price stability by targeting 2% CPI inflation and,

2

subject to that, to support the Government’s economic objectives for growth and employment.
Given this, we are obliged to remain firmly focused on the implications of developments in the
economy for inflation in the medium term. There is now widespread recognition of the fact that
the challenge for the MPC in setting interest rates is to try to balance two significant risks to the
UK economy – the downside risk to demand and output which could eventually drag inflation
below the target and the risk that upside shocks to energy and food prices lead to a more
persistent period of inflation above the 2% target that becomes embedded in inflation
expectations.

One striking feature of the inflationary pressure that we face in the UK is how far this is being
mirrored by the experience in other countries. Inflation in the eurozone is 3.6%, the highest
since the inception of the euro. In the US it is 4.0%1, in China 8.3% and in India 7.8%2. All are
higher than a year ago. The fact that all countries have experienced increases in energy, food
and other commodity prices is a significant factor. Wheat prices have risen from US$4.50 per
bushel to US$7.62 per bushel and oil from US$65 per barrel to $111 per barrel over the past
twelve months3. These, of course, reflect the strong global economic performance in recent
times – powered by the spectacular performances by India and China whose average annual
growth rates have exceeded 8.5% and 10.2% respectively over the past five years. In short, the
world does appear to have become a more inflationary place of late.

Looking at these issues in a broader historical context, the synchronous movement in inflation
rates across industrialized economies4 is quite striking. This can be seen in Chart 1, and it has
been the subject of a number of recent economic analyses.5 Many of you here will have lived
through the early part of the period in this chart – sometimes labelled “the Great Inflation”. The
Chart illustrates just how similar inflation rates have been across the industrialized world, with
most countries experiencing high and volatile inflation during the 1970s and part of the 1980s,
and low and stable inflation thereafter. The cause of this moderation in inflation is much

Here, I will focus here on the experiences of nine countries only: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
New Zealand, Japan, UK and US. However, the arguments discussed here are relevant to most OECD
economies.

debated.6 In a nutshell, there are three main candidates: good luck, structural economic change
and good policy.

The suggestion that the moderation in inflation is down to good luck argues that economies have
not, in more recent times, been subjected to too many inflationary cost shocks of the kind that we
saw, in particular, with the two oil price hikes of 1973 and 1979. This, so the story goes, has
diminished the challenges faced by policy-makers charged with controlling inflation.

Given that the current pressure on inflation is so readily attributed to food and energy price
pressures, it is tempting to believe that such movements are exceptional and that the great
moderation was a reflection of stable commodity prices. In fact, this turns out not be true as is
illustrated in Chart 2 which shows little evidence of a reduction in volatility in primary goods
prices over either period.7

When I was first taught economics in the 1970s, it was sometimes suggested that the oil price
shocks of 1973 and 1979 caused the ‘Great Inflation’. But it was soon realized that this does not
work as an explanation of inflation since these shocks were sudden and temporary while the
inflation that they created was persistent. Of course, some kinds of commodity prices – notably
oil – do generate temporary fluctuations in inflation as they pass through to households. But
they cannot account, on their own, for persistent inflation. Indeed, Chart 3 shows that, excluding
the episodes of 1973 and 1979, oil price inflation and a measure of international inflation are
virtually uncorrelated. 8 So I think that we need to look elsewhere to understand what drives the
persistent patterns in inflation seen in Chart 1.

One possibility is to look behind the causes of the current increases in commodity prices – which
are largely attributable to the strength of the global economy, particularly the integration into the
world economy of China and India.
Perhaps bouts of inflation in the industrialized world are then simply a reflection of global
economic success. Chart 4 looks at this issue plotting the relationship between global economic
growth and international inflation in a sample of nine OECD countries suggesting a negative

The academic literature now uses the term the “Great Moderation” to refer to the decline in the volatility of
output growth. Here, I note that a similar decline occurred in the level and volatility of inflation across most
industrialized economies.

relationship between the two. Viewing this relationship as a structural feature of the global
economy is tempting, but there are at least a couple of reasons to resist such a temptation.9 First,
in a world of floating exchange rates, there is scope for exchange rates to adjust across countries
in response to domestic and foreign shocks.10 Second, the recent period of global growth has
been associated with an expansion in world trade that has reduced the costs of many
manufactured goods in particular.11

The structural change explanation for lower rates of inflation in recent years puts weight on the
idea that fundamental reforms to product and labour markets, particularly in response to
increased competition due to trade openness, has increased the flexibility of economies. This, in
turn, makes it less likely that a given shock to costs or to demand results in inflationary
pressure.12 While there is little doubt that some economies are more flexible now than in the
past, it is not at all obvious that this should result in lower inflation even though there may be
many other beneficial consequences of increased flexibility. In particular, another feature of
Chart 4 – the observation that the rates of output growth in industrialized economies have been
considerably less volatile since the mid-1980s – may well be attributable in part to increased
flexibility.

The third explanation for the more recent experience of low inflation emphasises good policy.
This has also been discussed extensively in the recent academic and policy literature.13 Before
turning to this in detail, let me begin with the observation that most, though not all, OECD
countries appear to have had somewhat similar policies in the two periods documented in Chart
1. To see this, it is useful to look at Chart 5 which gives the short term interest rate in a sample
of OECD countries. The Chart illustrates the proposition that policies (in terms of central bank
policy rates) have tended to move together.

However, this observation tells us little on its own since the challenges being faced by policy
makers were similar too. To believe that policy played a role in the moderation of inflation, one
9

Borio and Filardo (2007) construct measures of the global output gap and show that these measures have
some marginal predictive power for domestic inflation, over and above measures of domestic slack, using
data for a panel of OECD countries. Ihrig et al. (2007) assess the robustness of their results and provide
evidence against the hypothesis that globalization has increased the relative role of international factors in
shaping the inflation process across eleven OECD countries. See Mishkin (2007) for an overview of this
debate.

would need also to observe that the stance of policy was similar across countries. Chart 6 gives
us one clue on this. It plots the real interest rate, i.e. the policy rate adjusted for inflation, in nine
countries over the period that I have been discussing. The message that I take away from this is
that the period of high and volatile inflation was associated with negative real interest rates,
which can be interpreted as symptomatic of a relaxed monetary policy. The most recent period
of low and stable inflation is characterized, in contrast, by positive and higher real rates of
interest.

This observation is consistent with what sometimes is called the Taylor principle – the notion
that, in response to inflationary pressures, a central bank that wishes to maintain control over
inflation needs to raise the nominal interest rate enough to generate a positive real rate. The fact
that the central bank is expected to conform to the Taylor principle contributes to managing the
demand side of the economy and keeps inflation expectations anchored around low inflation.
Furthermore, the experience of recent years suggests that once credibility is established, inflation
can be kept under control through sequences of small changes of the policy rate in the same
direction.

This view that monetary policy matters argues that the main contrast between the two broad
periods of inflation experience in Chart 1 can be attributed to a significant change in central bank
responses to inflation. In the 1970s and 80s there were few central banks whose policy
responses to inflation provide a sufficient tightening of policy in the face of inflation to anchor
public beliefs around low and stable inflation. As is made clear by Chart 6, an exception to the
general picture was the Bundesbank which kept stable and positive real interest rates over this
period with the result that German inflation remained low and stable even though it was subject
to the same international cost shocks as the other countries in this Chart.14

In the United States, monetary policy changed notably in the 1980s during Paul Volcker’s tenure
as chairman of the Fed. He began the process of disinflation in the United States economy which
initiated a fundamental change in the intellectual climate on monetary policy thinking, leading
ultimately to the adoption of explicit inflation targeting mandates in New Zealand in 1990,
Canada in 1991, the UK in 1992, Sweden in 1995 and other countries thereafter (see Chart 7).
But the constituency for low inflation was not built in a day. It took some time for the low
inflation norm, supported by appropriate monetary policy, to become enshrined in behaviour.
14

This argument comes from Mumtaz and Surico (2008).

6

During the period of low and stable inflation, monetary policy in the UK has been focused on the
control of inflation, in line with the remit to maintain price stability. But, having been so
successful in achieving this end, there is a danger that monetary policy will be asked to do more.
In particular, monetary policy makers may be expected to protect the economy against persistent
real shocks in the mistaken view that adjustments in real living standards can be avoided. This is
an important issue in the UK at the present time when the economy is going through a period of
rebalancing away from consumption and towards closing our current account deficit. At the
same time, we are adjusting to the real implications of the credit shock. Monetary policy can
perhaps smooth some of the adjustment in response to changes in the real economy. However, in
my view, it cannot (and should not, therefore, try to) prevent warranted real economy changes
taking place.

Given the immediacy of the present, it is always tempting to think that the lessons of history
offer little help to the challenges that we face today. But I think that there are two main lessons
worth thinking about in the current context.

First, this brief tour of history serves as a reminder that inflation targeting was born of a practical
recognition that monetary policy can be used to manage inflation. The experience of the past
suggests that using monetary policy to support the economy in the face of negative real
productivity shocks had little success. In many cases, central banks were made independent and
given their inflation targeting remits to avoid a repeat of these errors. This affects the strategy of
the MPC in a subtle, but important, way. In line with our remit, monetary policy in the UK
ought to remain focused on achieving price stability as defined by the inflation target. Hence, we
should avoid trying to offset downside shocks to the real economy except in so far as they lead to
downside risks to inflation in the medium term. The remit does, however, give the MPC the
scope to exercise its judgement about the best way to influence the path of the economy towards
that objective.

Among the reasons that I welcome the initiative announced by the Bank of England yesterday is
that it is targeted directly at alleviating a key stress that has followed from the current disruption
in financial markets. This should allow the MPC to stay more focused on its task of using
monetary policy to target inflation.

7

Second, there are challenges faced by the pressures that come from the similarities and
differences in the policy stances of central banks around the world. One of my earliest academic
papers was on the role of yardstick competition in shaping public policy decisions.15 The focus
of that work was on the observation that tax reforms (particularly increases in taxation) appeared
to be correlated across states in the United States. It turned out that Governors of US states did
not like to put up taxes unilaterally and there was an electoral cost to them of doing so. But if
they put up taxes when Governors in surrounding states were also putting up taxes, then the
electoral effect appeared muted. The main lesson from this strand of research is that particular
domestic policies can be accepted more easily by the public if they are adopted also by countries
that share a similar macroeconomic performance. The experience of the ‘Great Inflation’ of the
1970s as well as of the current credit crunch makes me only too aware of real time yardstick
competition when strategies are being compared around the world. But, in the face of this, it is
important to remain focused on implementing the policy that is needed based on circumstances
here in the UK

The MPC is now beginning its series of meetings leading up to the publication of the May
Inflation Report. These meetings provide a good opportunity for us to look in greater detail at
some aspects of the challenges that we currently face. In particular, it will be possible to process
all the economic news since February and to assess how it affects the balance of risks, both
upside and downside, to achieving the inflation target in the medium term. The arrangements
that we now have in the UK allow the MPC to do so reflectively and independently, drawing on
the considerable technical expertise of the Bank of England’s staff. Our inflation targeting remit
anchors the discussions of the MPC so that we, in turn, can do our best to keep businesses’ and
households’ inflation expectations anchored around the 2% target. This provides the best context
to maintain the credibility of the framework that we have in the UK and allows monetary policy
to play its part in maintaining the stability that is needed for households and businesses to plan
for the long-term.
