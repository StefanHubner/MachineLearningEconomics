Effects on Labour Supply of Changes in the
State Pension Age 2010-22
From April 2010, the female state pension has risen in stages until, as of the first quarter of
this year, it sits at 66. This variation in the state pension age (SPA) allows us to estimate
how extending the SPA by one more year affects labour supply (Table 1).
All our analysis is based on the individual responses to the Labour Force Survey.
Our models are estimated from 2009 Q2 up to 2022 Q1. We follow Cribb et al’s (2013)
lead and begin our sample roughly one year before the SPA escalator commenced.
Therefore, our estimates provide the average marginal effect on participation of raising the
female SPA over different age cohorts.
Relative to Cribb et al (2013), we estimate a parsimonious specification, but find results
that lie in the same ballpark. We control for individuals’ age in quarters using dummies.
Likewise, we control for macroeconomic conditions using quarterly time dummies. We also
include dummies for educational attainment, where the baseline case is an individual with
GCSE or lower educational attainment.
We limit our sample to the age range affected by the reforms.
We estimate both a linear and probit model to estimate the marginal effect. As the probit
model relies on a non-linear specification, we compute the marginal effect of the SPA at
the sample means. Under both specifications, we find that being above the SPA lowers
female participation, on average, by 8-9pp. By including interactions, we can see that
reaching the SPA has around a 5-7pp smaller effect on women with degree or higher
education attainment than those with GCSE or lower education attainment. This may
reflect the fact that people with higher education attainment on average have higher
incomes, and hence are less reliant on the state pension. There is no difference in the
effect of reaching the SPA for those with A-level or equivalent education attainment,
relative to those with GCSE or lower.
