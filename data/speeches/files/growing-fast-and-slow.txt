Tonight, I want to discuss economic growth. This may sound like standard fare. In the
media, economists spend much of their time discussing growth and its statistical
counterpart, Gross Domestic Product or GDP. At least for some, this focus is misplaced.
For example, it is increasingly well-recognised that GDP is a partial, and often imperfect,
measure of societal well-being.1 As Einstein said, not all that can be counted counts.
But even if it is not all that counts, sustained economic growth remains the single most
important determinant of rising societal living standards. To bring that point to life,
consider two economies – China and Italy. As recently as 1990, the aggregate annual
income of these two economies was roughly equal.2 Now let’s run these economies
forward, with China growing at more than 10% per year, Italy by less than 1% per year.
By 2014, what do we find? Due to the magic of compound interest, China is now almost
eight times the size of Italy. Indeed, China creates a new economy the size of Italy every
18 months; an economy the size of Portugal every quarter; an economy the size of
Greece every month; and an economy the size of Cyprus every week. Those things that
can be counted sometimes really do count.
Today’s policy debates bear testimony to that. Since the financial crisis, global growth has
under-performed. In the decade prior to it, advanced economy growth averaged 3% per
year. In the period since, it has averaged just 1%. The world has grown fast, then slow.
That has led some to fear “secular stagnation” – a lengthy period of sub-par growth.3 The
self-same concerns were voiced at the time of the Great Depression in the 1930s.4
The economic jury is still out on whether recent rates of growth are a temporary post-crisis
dip or a longer-lasting valley in our economic fortunes. Pessimists point to high levels of
debt and inequality, worsening demographics and stagnating levels of educational
attainment.5 Optimists appeal to a new industrial revolution in digital technology.6 Given
its importance to living standards, this debate is one of the key issues of our time.
Some insight into that debate can be provided by looking at patterns of growth through a
long lens. Over long runs of history, it is possible to detect distinct phase shifts in growth.
Some growth epochs have seen secular stagnation, others secular innovation.

Understanding the determinants of these growth phases - sociological and technological –
provides insight into the forces of secular stagnation and innovation operating today.7
What follows is a cocktail of economics, history, sociology and psychology. For those
seeking a common denominator, it is sitting between your ears. Psychologist Daniel
Kahneman says the brain has two ways of thinking (fast and slow).8 The same may be
true, and for many of the same reasons, when understanding growth (fast and slow).
The Short History of Growth
Let me start with the short history of growth. This is shown in Chart 1 which plots (log)
world GDP per capita back to 1750, the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Save for wars,
it suggests a straight-line growth path over the past 250 years or so, averaging 1.5% per
year. That means each generation has been around a third better off than its predecessor.
Growth has driven secular rises in living standards, generation by generation.
While steady, growth has not been constant. Wars, depressions and financial crises have
pock-marked history, causing growth to stall or fall. And phases of innovation have lifted
economic fortunes, caused living standards to leap. But whereas the growth lapses have
been temporary, the leaps have been permanent. Over the past two and a half centuries,
secular innovation has dwarfed secular stagnation.
In explaining rising living standards since 1750, economists have typically identified three
distinct innovation phases. Each was associated with a great leap forward in society’s
production possibility frontier.9 The first is the Industrial Revolution commencing in the
middle of the 18th century; the second, the era of mass industrialisation, starting in the
second half of the 19th century; and the third is the IT revolution, which began life in the
second half of the 20th century.
What distinguished these three innovation phases is that they gave birth to a sequence of
so-called General Purpose Technologies (GPTs).10 These technologies had applicability
well beyond the sector for which they were originally designed, thereby transforming the
efficiency of business practices generally. During the first industrial revolution, these
GPTs included the steam engine, cotton spinning and railways; during the second,
7

Some have focussed on demand-side deficiencies as a source of secular stagnation (for example, Summers (2014)).
My focus here is on structural, supply-side factors. To the extent Say’s Law operates – with supply creating its own
demand, or lack of it – this distinction may not be that great over the medium-term.

electricity, the internal combustion engine and internal water supply and sanitation; and in
the third, the personal computer and the internet.
Interest in innovation-led growth has re-intensified over recent years as growth prospects
have dimmed. One strand of the secular stagnation debate asks - wither innovation?
Among some there is a concern the well of innovation may be running dry. 11 For others,
the well of innovation generated by the digital revolution is poised to gush.12 Will secular
stagnation or secular innovation dominate?
The Long History of Growth
To begin to address that question, let’s start by taking a longer look at the past. One
reason for doing so is that the long history of growth looks rather different than the short.
Secularly rising living standards have become the social and economic norm. No-one can
recall a time when the growth escalator has moved anything other than upwards.
Yet viewed through a long lens telescope, ‘twas not ever thus. Chart 2 plots estimates of
global GDP per capita back to 1000 BC. This suggests a very different growth story. For
three millennia prior to the Industrial Revolution, growth per head averaged only 0.01% per
year. Global living standards were essentially flat. Since 1750, it has taken around 50
years for living standards to double. Prior to 1750, it would have taken 6000 years.
This suggests very different economic and social norms before the Industrial Revolution.
Generational improvements in well-being would have been imperceptible. The growth
escalator was permanently out-of-service. Steadily and secularly rising living standards
have not been the historical norm. Rather, they are a latter-day exception. Over the long
sweep, secular stagnation has been far more common than secular innovation.
It could be argued that GDP is too narrow to capture improvements in societal living
standards that far back in history. Non-material measures of well-being might provide a
better guide. Is it plausible to believe the welfare of the average citizen in 1800 was no
different than at the dawn of the second Millennium?
Sociological evidence suggests yes, as Gregory Clark’s excellent book makes clear.13
Average years of life expectancy were essentially unchanged for several millennia prior to

1800. For an adult surviving to age 20, life expectancy hovered between 30-40 years.14
Over the same period, birth and death rates were likewise constant. That meant the global
population scarcely budged prior to 1750, growing at an annual rate of less than 0.1%.
Measures of well-being during life (rather than death) tell a similar tale. Adult heights,
measured from skeletal records, averaged around 160-170 cm for many centuries prior to
1800 (Chart 3). Levels of calorific intake were also flat. Scholars have constructed “social
development indices”, using these and other indicators.15 These follow a remarkably
similar path to GDP, with well-being unchanged (Chart 4).
These well-being measures suggest global living standards plateaued for the majority of
the past 3000 years, before rocketing over the past 300. Prior to the Industrial Revolution,
income was locked at close to subsistence levels. In line with Thomas Malthus’s
predictions, they were sufficient to sustain the population, but no more.16 For that reason,
some have called this the Malthusian era.17
If you think that’s sounds grim, the picture further back in history is, if anything, even less
optimistic. Rather remarkably, estimates of global GDP have been constructed back to 1
million BC, the dawn of man.18 Statistical agencies were thinly staffed back then, so these
statistics need to be treated with an even greater than usual pinch of salt.
Table 1 considers growth rates in per capita GDP and population over that longer sample.
For much of the history of mankind, there was effectively no rise in either living standards
or population. It is possible the most gradual of advances in living standards began tens of
thousands of years ago, around the time modern man (homo sapiens) emerged and
Neanderthal man (homo Neanderthalensis) disappeared.
So the short history (the Golden era) and the long history (the Malthusian era) of growth
could not be more different. Secular innovation followed a lengthy period of secular
stagnation. Discernible rises in living standards are a very recent phenomenon. If the
history of growth were a 24-hour clock, 99% would have come in the last 20 seconds.

Technological Roots of Industrial Revolution
So what caused this phase shift in growth? Explaining even historical growth patterns is
far from easy. Even now, there remains an active debate among economic and social
historians about the deep sources of growth. Without doing it justice, let me offer some
reflections based on that literature. Linking them is a common theme: patience.
Neo-Classical economics explains why patience matters for growth. It supports saving
which in turn finances investment, the accumulation of capital. That capital accumulation,
in combination with great leaps forward the efficiency of its use, is what Neo-Classical
growth theory tells us drives growth. Today’s investment is tomorrow’s growth.19
Growth in the Neo-Classical model is “exogenous” – determined by external forces. The
two key such forces are, first, the patience of individuals which is assumed to be fixed over
time and across states of nature. And, second, by technological progress, which is
assumed to vary over time but in unpredictable ways. Innovation arrives as manna from
heaven, a surprise gift that keeps on giving.
On the face of it, this simple story does a decent job of explaining the phase shift in growth
after the Industrial Revolution. The second half of the 18th century saw a sequence of
closely-clustered innovations in England: Hargreaves’ spinning jenny was invented in
1764, Arkwright’s water frame in 1769, Watt’s steam engine in 1775. These arrived as
manna from heaven, shifting outwards society’s production possibility frontier just as NeoClassical growth theory would predict.
It took time for these fledgling GPTs to broaden their application and influence, measured
in decades.20 Growth and productivity only began picking up well into the 19th century. As
they did, this generated a wave of physical investment – in factories, machines,
locomotives. This combination of rapid investment, and technological transformation, lit
the fuse on a Golden era of sustained rises in living standards, the first in human history.
This Neo-Classical account of growth dynamics is lent support by Table 2 which shows
estimates of growth in technological efficiency either side of the Industrial Revolution.21
Prior to it, technological gains were fractions of a percent each year. Outward shifts in the
production possibility frontier, like rises in living standards, would have been imperceptible.
19

For example, the models of Solow-Swann model (Solow (1956) and Swann (1956)) and Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans
(Ramsey (1929), Cass (1965), Koopmans (1965)).
20
See, for example, Eichengreen (2014).
21
These are taken from Clark (2009) for the period up until 1750 and based on Bank estimates in the subsequent
period.

After 1750, a technological light switch was flicked. Growth in technological efficiency has
averaged around 1% per year in the period since.
Technological advance, in turn, fed physical capital accumulation. Chart 5 shows the path
of the physical capital stock per head in the UK after 1850. It has risen, on average, by
1.75% per year. It has also shown a striking positive relationship with growth in GDP per
head: for every £1000 rise in the capital stock per head since 1850, GDP per head has
risen by £400 per head. This, too, is just as Neo-Classical growth theory would predict.
That same pattern is replicated across countries. Chart 6 plots the relationship between
the capital stock and GDP per head since 1980 in a cross-section of countries. Clearly,
countries are on different steps on the growth escalator. But in each case this escalator
has moved relentlessly upward, with sustained rises in the capital stock associated with
secular rises in per capita incomes. Yesterday’s investment has been today’s growth.
Sociological Roots of Industrial Revolution
If this were the whole story of three industrial revolutions, the growth recipe would be
simple. Growth, like surfing, would mean simply waiting for the next big innovation wave
to break. Rising living standards would be not so much natural as preternatural,
“suspended between the mundane and the miraculous”.22 Because policymakers cannot
part the waves or perform other miracles, public policy would have a minimal role.
One problem with this story, if experience prior to the Industrial Revolution is anything to
go by, is that it could be a long wait for that next big wave. A second is that this story is far
from the only possible reading of the historical runes. There is an alternative set of
economic theories, and empirical facts, which paint a different picture of the genesis of
growth either side of the Industrial Revolution.
This alternative account might loosely be called “endogenous” growth theory. 23 The
factors driving growth are multiple, not singular. They are as much sociological as
technological - skills and education, culture and cooperation, institutions and infrastructure.
These factors are mutually-supporting, not exogenous and idiosyncratic. And they build in
a cumulative, evolutionary fashion, rather than spontaneously combusting.

22

Douglas Allchin describes preternatural phenomena as being "suspended between the mundane and the
miraculous".

One way of accommodating these broader factors is to widen the definition of “capital”:
physical capital (such as plant and machinery); human capital (such as skills and
expertise); social capital (such as cooperation and trust); intellectual capital (such as
ideas and technologies); and infrastructural capital (such as transport networks and legal
systems).24 Growth results from the cumulative accretion of multiple sources of capital.
To take a simple example, the success of the railways relied not just on the invention of
the steam engine (intellectual capital), but on the materials (physical capital) and skills
(human capital) to build locomotives and track. And to become a GPT, railways needed in
addition a network (infrastructure capital) and the cooperation and trust of the general
public (social capital).
Looking at these multiple sources of capital, in turn, provides an account of the Industrial
Revolution whose genesis differs significantly from the Neo-Classical one.25 Take human
capital accumulation. One measure of that is literacy and numeracy in the population at
large. Chart 7 plots the level of adult literacy in a selection of Western Europe countries
from the late 15th century.
At that time, less than 10% of the population were literate. Measured levels of human
capital were miserably low, consistent with subsistence living standards. But in the
following three centuries, a transformation took place. Literacy rates in the adult
population shot up to around 50% in Western Europe, in some countries higher. In other
words, human capital accumulated at real pace prior to the Industrial Revolution.
This skills-deepening provided one foundation on which other sources of growth-enriching
capital were built – for example intellectual capital, the generation of ideas and innovation.
On this interpretation, sociological transformation supported, perhaps preceded,
technological transformation. Innovation was an earthly creation, not manna from heaven.
Since the Industrial Revolution, levels of educational attainment have continued to rise.
Since the Second World War, the number of years of schooling has risen rapidly (Chart 8),
more than trebling in emerging markets and almost doubling in advanced economies.
Latterly, that rise has been driven by increasing numbers of adults with degree-level
(tertiary) qualifications. Human capital has widened and deepened.

Empirical studies suggest higher educational standards may have accounted for as much
as a fifth of US growth since 1950.26 Given the much larger scale of improvement in
educational standards between the 16th and 18th centuries – the shift from an illiterate to a
largely literate workforce – human capital accumulation seems likely to have played an
even larger catalytic role in driving the Industrial Revolution.
The picture is similar if we move from human to social capital. This is a more difficult
concept to capture quantitatively. It embraces properties such as co-operation, reciprocity
and trust within society. Although more elusive, these sources of social capital have been
crucial to the success of nation states – for example, in supporting growth of trade.27
One measure of social capital used by sociologists is the incidence of violence or war in
society. This is the limiting case of a lack of cooperation or trust within or across societies;
it is the sociological equivalent of financial crisis.28 Chart 9 plots the incidence of murder
(homicide) in Western European countries since 1300. It, too, tells a striking story.
Violent crime fell dramatically between the 15th and 18th centuries, by a factor of around
five. By the time of the Industrial Revolution, it had levelled-off. Rapid social capital
accumulation provided a foundation for growth. Sociology nurtured technology.
With some interruptions, notably the two World Wars of the 20th century, those trends
towards lower levels of violence in society have continued to the present day. For
example, war deaths have been falling secularly since the 1940s (Chart 10). This is
consistent with a continuing accretion of social capital.29 Although hard to quantify, this too
is likely to have provided a tailwind to growth in the modern era.
Infrastructural and institutional capital are widely believed to have supported the growth
process.30 England was the birth place of the Industrial Revolution. Its parents, arguably,
were English institutions well into adolescence at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution: a
parliamentary system from the 11th and 12th centuries; a legal and judicial system from the
12th and 13th centuries; a central bank, the Bank of England, from the end of 17th century.
The government’s role, as an institution in society, also rose rapidly prior to the Industrial
Revolution. Chart 11 plots government spending as a fraction of national income in the
UK since 1200. Until around 1600, government accounted for only 1-2% of national

income. In the subsequent two centuries government came of age: its share of spending
rose 10 or 20-fold. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, institutions in general, and
government in particular, became an increasingly important growth-enabler.
Institutional and infrastructural capital has continued to accumulate in the period since.
Since 1950, the number of countries operating with democratic institutions has risen from
around 25 to almost 90.31 Legal systems globally have continued to improve in quality,
and central bank numbers have continued to swell. Cross-country studies have found that
the quality of these institutions and infrastructures is often key to driving growth.32
In what is perhaps the most comprehensive study of historical experience, Daron
Acemoglu and James Robinson have taken the institutional argument one step further.
For them, the lack of good institutions is the defining reason “Why Nations Fail”.33 You do
not need to go that far to think they have really mattered historically for living standards.
The final ingredient in the growth recipe is intellectual capital, for some the source of the
Industrial Revolution, Hargreaves, Arkwright, Watt and all. Yet it would be wrong to think
innovation somehow began in the 18th century. From the windmill in the 12th century, the
mechanical clock in the 13th, the cannon in the 14th, the printing press in the 15th, the
postal service in the 16th and the telescope and microscope in the 17th, the innovation
escalator was in service well before the Industrial Revolution, albeit stepped and sticky.34
Moreover, empirical evidence suggests a high degree of history-dependence, or
hysteresis, in technology transfer. Patterns of technology adoption in 1500 AD are a
remarkably good predictor of growth in 1800 AD.35 This suggests the technological seeds
of the Industrial Revolution were sown well before Hargreaves, Arkwright and Watt arrived
on the scene. Innovation is more earthly endeavour than heavenly intervention.
Taken together, this suggests a much broader and richer set of foundations for growth.
The seeds of the Industrial Revolution were sown much earlier, and scattered more widely,
than a Neo-Classical account would suggest. And sociological transformation was at least
as important as technological transformation in catalysing the lift-off in growth.

Patience as a Virtue
Even if you accept this multi-faceted explanation of growth - part sociological, part
technological – why did societies suddenly begin accumulating capital at particular points
in history? What prompted that initial investment in skills, co-operation, institutions,
infrastructure? One answer may lie inside our own heads. For those technological and
sociological trends may, in turn, have caused a re-wiring of our brains.
Underlying all investment decisions are what economists call “rates of time preference” –
and what non-economists call patience: the willingness to defer gratification today for the
benefit of tomorrow, to save rather than spend, stick rather than twist. One simple,
economy-wide, measure of societal patience is found in the pattern of interest rates.
Interest rates proxy society’s willingness to save or stick. The less willing they are to do so
– the greater their impatience - the higher the compensation they require. That
compensation takes the form of a higher interest rate. So, for a given level of saving, an
impatient society will have higher interest rates than a patient one.
Chart 12 plots a measure of short and long-term interest rates back to 3000 BC. Though
the data are patchy, they suggest interest rates fell secularly in the run-up to the Industrial
Revolution, from double-digits to around 3%. Alternative interest rates, such as the rate of
return on physical assets such as land, show a similar pattern.36
One interpretation of these trends is that they reflect society’s evolving time preferences.
In the run-up to the Industrial Revolution, society became more willing to wait than in the
past. That, in turn, enabled saving, investment and ultimately growth. Patience was a
virtue. But if society’s time preferences were indeed shifting, that still begs the question
why?
Here, we can enlist some outside help. Experimental research over the past 50 years, by
psychologists and neurologists, has taught us a great deal both about the determinants of
patience and how it affects behaviour. This can perhaps provide insights into some of the
historical drivers of a more patient, and hence higher growth, society.
One important driver of patience is income and wealth. The lower income, the more
impatient is human decision-making.37 Why? Because surviving on limited means

absorbs huge amounts of cognitive energy. 38 It causes a neurological focus on the nearterm. This myopic thinking has been found in everything from under-saving for retirement
to over-borrowing from pay-day lenders. In developing countries, it may help explain
poverty traps.39
During the Malthusian era, much of the population operated at close to subsistence
income levels. If experimental evidence is any guide, that is likely to have generated an
acute sense of societal short-termism. This may have manifested itself in, for example, a
failure to invest in physical and human capital, retarding growth. Poverty and impatience
would have been self-reinforcing, in a Malthusian poverty trap.
The raising of incomes above subsistence levels which occurred after 1800 will have
reversed that cycle. It will have boosted patience and laid the foundations for higher
saving and investment and, ultimately, growth. In other words, after the Industrial
Revolution patience may have created its own virtuous reward, endogenous growth style.
Technological innovation has also been found to influence patience.40 The invention of the
printing press by Guttenberg in around 1450 led to an explosion in book production. It is
estimated that there were more books produced in the 50 years after Guttenberg than in
the preceding 1000 years. What followed was much more than a technological
transformation.
Books contributed to a great leap forward in literacy levels, boosting human capital. More
speculatively, they may also have re-wired our brains. Nicholas Carr argues that the
changes brought about by the printing press, and other information media, may have reshaped our minds.41 Books laid the foundations for “deep reading” and, through that,
deeper and wider thinking. Technology was, quite literally, mind-bending.
It has been argued that this re-wiring stimulated the slow-thinking, reflective, patient part of
the brain identified by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman. If so, it will have
supported the accumulation of intellectual capital - creativity, ideas, innovation.
Technology will have first shaped neurology and then neurology technology, in a virtuous
loop. Slow thought will have made for fast growth.

It is possible to construct a quasi-neurological explanation of much-earlier shifts in growth.
The world’s growth journey appears to have commenced, in earnest, around the time
modern homo sapiens replaced Neanderthal man. Maybe that was no accident. Behind
the physiological shift from the ridge brows of Neanderthal man to the flat foreheads of
modern man may have been a more important neurological one.
Flat foreheads allowed growth in the pre-frontal cortex region of the brain. Modern-day
MRI scans tell us this region is responsible, among other things, for patience. What we
may have seen, tens of thousands of years ago, was Darwinian natural selection of patient
homo sapiens over impatient Neanderthals. 42 And with that came rising living standards.
The Secular Struggle - Innovation or Stagnation?
From the distant past, then, to the present and future. Today’s great debate is where next
for growth. The sunny uplands of innovation-led growth, as after the Industrial Revolution?
Or the foggy lowlands of stagnant growth, as before it? Which of the secular forces –
innovation versus stagnation – will dominate? And if growth is going back to the future, on
which side of the Industrial Revolution will it land?
The balance of these arguments matters greatly for future well-being and public policy.
Indeed, it is hard to think of anything that matters much more. More parochially, for central
banks setting monetary policy one of the key judgements is the appropriate “neutral” level
of interest rates. You can think of this as the interest rate that would align desired saving
and investment over the medium term.
But what is the “neutral” level of interest rates today? Secular innovation might imply a
level at or above its historical average of 2-3%, in line with historical growth rates. But
secular stagnation may imply a level much lower than in the past, possibly even negative.
In monetary policy, this is the difference between chalk and cheese, success and failure.
In this respect, the behaviour of global real interest rates over the past 30 years is
remarkable. Chart 13 plots a measure of real interest rates since 1990, in advanced and
emerging economies. Both have exhibited the same secular downward trend, falling by
around two percentage points per decade. Today, they are around zero.
For some advanced countries, the pattern is even more striking. Chart 14 plots the real
interest rates expected over the next 30 years in the UK and euro-area. For both, real

rates are expected to remain negative for the next three decades. Investors are willing to
pay governments for the privilege of lending to them for the next 30 years – a negative rate
of time preference. This pattern has no historical precedent.
One interpretation is society having become significantly more patient, as in the lead up to
the Industrial Revolution: higher global saving relative to investment would lower global
real interest rates. If that is the cause, bring out the bunting. By lowering the cost, and
raising the return to innovation, investment and growth would be stimulated.43 Falls in real
rates would signal secular innovation. The optimists would have it.
But an alternative reading is possible. Low real rates may instead reflect a dearth of
profitable investment opportunities relative to desired savings. If that is the cause, bring
out the bodies. For this would imply low returns to innovation and low future growth.
Falling real rates would instead signal secular stagnation. The pessimists would have it.
I want to argue, in a typically two-handed economist way, that both sides of this argument
are right. There are good grounds for believing technological forces are driving innovation
and hence growth, in a classic Neo-Classical cycle. But there are equally-good grounds
for believing sociological forces are retarding growth, in an endogenous-growth pattern.
Let me start with the secular innovation side of the argument, the Neo-Classical account.
It contends that future growth will be forged in the white heat of a digital revolution. All
GPTs take time to reach their melting point.44 Even very rapid, or exponential, rates of
technological growth take time to become truly transformative at an economy-wide level.45
Given past trends, it could take 30-40 years or longer for GPTs to reach critical velocity.
That was the case with earlier GPTs, including the steam engine and electricity. Growth
rates in digital efficiency are higher than in earlier episodes, with Moore’s Law – the
doubling of computer processing capacity every 18 months or so – typically taken as the
yardstick for this time being different.
Nonetheless, even with Moore’s Law operating, it is only recently that the digital revolution
may have reached critical velocity. Perhaps consistent with that, a number of
transformative technologies have arrived on the scene recently, including in the fields of
43

There are less optimistic interpretations of this rise in savings, including that it reflects a “savings glut” among in
particular emerging market economies (Bernanke (2011), or that is reflects a shortage of supply of safe assets for
investors (Caballero (2013)).

robotics, genetics, 3D printing, Big Data and the “internet of things”. 46 These are not new.
What is new is their widening application, as they have moved from inventions to GPTs.
Economist Brian Arthur has a beautiful metaphor for describing this transition – the
transition from a physical (or “first”) economy to a digital (or “second”) economy.47 He
likens earlier industrial revolutions to the body developing its physiological or muscular
system. By analogy, the economic system was defining and refining its motor skills,
largely through investment in physical capital.
The digital revolution is different. It is akin to the economic body developing its
neurological or sensory system, defining and refining its cognitive skills through investment
in intellectual capital. The success of the recent wave of transformative technologies is
built on them creating a neural – brain-like – network of connections. The “internet of
things” uses multiple sensors (like the brain’s neurons) connected through the web (like
the brain’s synapses) to create, in effect, a machine-brain.
It is that brain-like wiring which has given rise to thinking, as well as doing, machines – the
move from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). In the words of
Brynjolfsson and McAfee, we are entering a second machine age.48 Moreover, Moore’s
Law means that the processing power of the machine brain is ever-rising. That leads to
the intriguing possibility that, at some point in the future, the processing power of the
machine brain could exceed the human brain.
Back in 1958, John von Neumann – perhaps the father of modern computing - called such
an event the “singularity”.49 There has since been considerable speculation about its
likelihood. Computer processing speeds have reached around 10^16 calculations per
second.50 That still falls well short of the brain’s computational capacity. But if Moore’s
Law continues, the machine brain could match the human brain within decades.51
Were the singularity to be reached, the sky becomes the limit innovation-wise. Machine,
rather than man, then becomes the mother of all invention. With exponential rises in
processing power, the economy could become “super-intelligent”. And with close to zero
marginal costs to expanding processing capacity, it may also become “super-efficient”.

This would indeed be a fourth industrial revolution. But unlike its predecessors, and
almost by definition, it would be near-impossible for the human brain to imagine where the
machine brain would take innovation, and hence growth, next. The world would be one of
blissful ignorance. The excitement of the optimists would be fully warranted.
Let me now take the other side of the argument. What secular forces could retard growth?
Technology, by itself, was arguably insufficient to explain growth in the past. It may also
be insufficient to secure growth in the future. The sociological roots of growth also matter.
Some of those sociological roots are less well planted than in the past. Indeed, in some
cases technology may have contributed to an uprooting.
Take social capital. While violent crime and war are hopefully in secular decline, other
measures of social capital are depreciating. One diagnostic is rising levels of social
inequality.52 The income share of the top 1% of earners has doubled in the UK and US
since 1980. Patterns of wealth inequality are, if anything, even more striking. 53
Recent evidence suggests such a depreciation of social capital, through rising inequality,
slows growth. Cross-country studies by the IMF and OECD have found a significant and
sustained drag from inequality on growth.54 The IMF study estimates that a one
percentage point rise in a country’s Gini coefficient – a measure income distribution –
lowers growth by around 0.1 percentage point.
Let’s apply that to some real data. The Gini coefficient in the US has risen by eight
percentage points since 1980. That suggests inequality could have been a drag on past
US growth of almost one percentage point each year. In an era of low growth, that is a
strikingly strong headwind from lower levels of social capital.
And looking ahead, it is possible that sociological headwind could strengthen. One of the
causes of rising inequality in advanced economies is believed to be the loss of middle-skill
jobs, at least relative to high and low-skill jobs. There has been a “hollowing out” in
employment.55 Technological advance – the mechanisation of middle-skill tasks - is
believed to have contributed importantly to these trends.

The second machine age could intensify, possibly broaden, these trends.56 Intelligent
robots could substitute for lower-skilled tasks. If the capacity of the machine brain
approached, or surpassed, the human brain, higher-skilled jobs could also be at risk.
Where this leaves trends in employment, inequality and social capital is unclear. But, most
likely, this would be far from blissful ignorance.
A second secular headwind, closely related to rising inequality, concerns human capital.
Inequality may retard growth because it damps investment in education, in particular by
poorer households.57 Studies show parental income is crucial in determining children’s
educational performance.58 If inequality is generational and self-perpetuating, so too will
be its impact on growth.
US evidence suggests striking, and rising, differences in educational attainment across
different socio-economic groups. Prior to 1970, rising high school completion rates
permanently raised the productivity of US workers. Latterly, those improvements have
stalled and, for some, have reversed. The US is slipping down the international league
tables of educational attainment.59
There is evidence the UK could be following suit. The UK is currently below average for
literacy and numeracy skills across OECD countries.60 Between 2003 and 2011, although
the proportion of adults with literacy skills increased from 44% to 57%, those with
numeracy skills decreased from 26% to 22%.61 To put that in perspective, 17 million
adults in England have numerical skills only equal to those of a primary school child.
Even without these headwinds, human capital may be set to grow less rapidly in future for
demographic reasons. In the second half of the 20th century, population growth added two
percentage points to global growth each year (Chart 15). Since 1980, that has fallen to
around 1% per year. By 2050, it is predicted to have halved again. That would translate,
pretty much one-for-one, into lower trend growth rates.62
A third secular, sociological headwind concerns short-termism. That sits oddly with
historical trends, which points towards secular rises in societal levels of patience, in part

driven by technological trends. But those trends may themselves be on the turn. Just as
the printing press may have caused a neurological re-wiring after the 15th century, so too
may the Internet in the 21st. But this time technology’s impact may be less benign.63
We are clearly in the midst of an information revolution, with close to 99% of the entire
stock of information ever created having been generated this century.64 This has had real
benefits. But it may also have had cognitive costs. One of those potential costs is shorter
attention spans. As information theorist Herbert Simon said, an information-rich society
may be attention-poor.65 The information revolution could lead to patience wearing thin.
Some societal trends are consistent with that. The tenure of jobs and relationships is
declining. The average tenure of Premiership football managers has fallen by one month
per year since 1994.66 On those trends, it will fall below one season by 2020. And what is
true of football is true of finance. Average holding periods of assets have fallen tenfold
since 1950. The rising incidence of attention deficit disorders, and the rising prominence
of Twitter, may be further evidence of shortening attention spans.
If so, that would tend to make for shorter-term decision-making. Using Daniel Kahneman’s
classification, it may cause the fast-thinking, reflexive, impatient part of the brain to expand
its influence. If so, that would tend to raise societal levels of impatience and slow the
accumulation of all types of capital. This could harm medium-term growth. Fast thought
could make for slow growth.
Psychological studies have shown that impatience in children can significantly impair
educational attainment and thus future income prospects.67 Impatience has also been
found to reduce creativity among individuals, thereby putting a brake on intellectual capital
accumulation.68 Innovation and research are potential casualties from short-termism.
There is evidence suggesting just that. Investment by public companies is often found to
be deferred or ignored to meet the short-term needs of shareholders.69 Research and
development spending by UK companies has been falling for a decade. They are towards

the bottom of the international research and development league table (Chart 16). If shorttermism is on the rise, this puts at risk skills-building, innovation and future growth.70
A final ingredient is infrastructure capital. Here again, investment trends are not
encouraging. In advanced economies, public investment has been on a gently downwards
path for the past three decades (Chart 17). In the UK, public investment relative to GDP is
a third of its level in 1970. There has been no deepening in the global capital stock for a
generation, if anything the opposite. Given the role public investment has often played in
the past in supporting private innovation, this is not an entirely comforting picture.71
In sum, if history and empirical evidence is any guide, this cocktail of sociological factors,
individually and in combination, could restrain growth. They could jeopardise the promise
of the fourth industrial revolution. Pessimists’ concerns would be warranted.
Conclusion
Growth is a gift. Yet contrary to popular perceptions, it has not always kept on giving.
Despite centuries of experience, the raw ingredients of growth remain something of a
mystery. As best we can tell historically, they have been a complex mix of the sociological
and the technological, typically acting in harmony. All three of the industrial revolutions
since 1750 bear these hallmarks.
Today, the growth picture is foggier. We have fear about secular stagnation at the same
time as cheer about secular innovation. The technological tailwinds to growth are strong,
but so too are the sociological headwinds. Buffeted by these cross-winds, future growth
risks becoming suspended between the mundane and the miraculous.

(2015 forthcoming), Bank of England, Historical Statistics of the United States Millenial Edition , Volume 3 and Federal
Reserve Economic Database. Notes: the intervals on the x-axis change through time up to 1715. From 1715 onwards
the intervals are every twenty years. Prior to the C18th the rates reflect the country with the lowest rate reported for each
type of credit: 3000BC to 6th century BC - Babylonian empire; 6th century BC to 2nd century BC - Greece; 2nd century
BC to 5th century AD - Roman Empire; 6th century BC to 10th century AD - Byzantium (legal limit); 12th century AD to
13th century AD - Netherlands ;13th century AD to 16th century AD - Italian states. From the C18th the interest rates
are of an annual frequency and reflect those of the most dominant money market: 1694 to 1918 this is assumed to be
the UK; from 1919-2015 this is assumed to be the US. Rates used are as follows: Short rates: 1694-1717- Bank of
England Discount rate;1717-1823 rate on 6 month East India bonds; 1824-1919 rate on 3 month prime or first class bills;
1919-1996 rate on 4-6 month prime US commerical paper ; 1997-2014 rate on 3month AA US commercial paper to nonfinancials. Long rates: 1702-1919 - rate on long-term government UK annuities and consols; 1919-1953, yield on longterm US government bond yields; 1954-2014 yield on 10 year US treasuries.

'World' Real Rate

Source: King and Low (2014); Bank Calculations. Notes: The ‘World’ real rate (black line) is taken from King and Low
(2014) and is based on the average 10-year yield of inflation-linked bonds in the G7 countries (excluding Italy). UK rates
have been adjusted to take account of the RPI-CPI wedge. Data availability means that US yields are only included from
1997 so the UK provides most of the historical back-run.

using euro-area inflation swaps (as a proxy for the euro-area risk free rate). The measure of inflation used is RPI for the
United Kingdom and CPI for the United States and the euro area. Data are to close of business 9 February 2015.

Source: IMF World Economic Outlook October 2014; ONS. Notes: The Advanced Economies line show real public
investment as a share of PPP weighted GDP. The UK line shows nominal net investment as a share of nominal GDP.
This series follows a similar pattern to real general Government investment, but is available over a longer time horizon.
The definition of what is classified as ‘public’ has changed over time and at different speeds in different places, which
may account for some of the differences between the UK and other Advanced Economies.
