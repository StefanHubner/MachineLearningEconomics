I am delighted to be able to take part in this conference, and particularly pleased to be sharing the platform this morning
with Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh of the Central Bank of Iran, Bank Markazi.
I first met Governor Nourbakhsh soon after he became Governor in 1994 - which was not an easy time for Iran. I was
immediately impressed not only by his command of the issues confronting him - which was perhaps not surprising: it was
his second period in office as Governor, having in the meantime taken a vacation as Minister of Economic Affairs and
Finance, and as Deputy to the President, with responsibility for Economic Affairs. But I was immediately impressed too
by his calm and always reasoned approach and by his reliability. He has played an important role in steering his country
through a difficult period to the more promising prospect that Iran faces today. Since our first meeting, I have very much
enjoyed the opportunity of seeing the Governor periodically at a whole series of international meetings, and it is a very
great pleasure, Mohsen, to be able to join in welcoming you here to London this morning. I have been immensely
interested in - and greatly encouraged by - what you have had to tell us.
Perhaps I might add a few observations of my own - from my inevitably more distant perspective.
For much of the past two or three years the external environment facing Iran was a difficult one. The slowdown in world
economic growth in the wake of the global financial crisis and the associated fall in oil prices - to an unsustainably low
level - significantly weakened the financial positions of all major oil-exporting countries. Iran was no exception. The
current account swung from a surplus of 2.2% of GDP in 1997/98 to a deficit of over 2%. And the fiscal position
deteriorated to a deficit of 6.7% of GDP.
But Iran's response to worsening economic conditions was a positive one. The authorities began to formulate a mediumterm reform strategy, which has now been articulated as the Third Five Year Development Plan. Since then, the
combination of sound economic management at home, coupled with continued economic expansion in the industrial
countries and rising oil prices, have improved Iran's prospects considerably.
The IMF forecast GDP growth of 3.4% in Iran in 2000/01. The external account has strengthened, with a surplus of 4.7%
of GDP recorded in 1999/2000. And the budgetary position swung from deficit to a surplus of 1% of GDP in 1999/00.
Foreign exchange reserves have risen by $2 billion to $6 billion since 1998/99. Although inflation remains still quite high
at around 20%, broad money growth has shown signs of moderating. Debt levels are also now below the average for
emerging market economies. Perhaps above all else, it is encouraging that the authorities have not rested on their
laurels, but have instead sought to take advantage of this recent more favourable economic environment to increase the
momentum of reform. The overall macro-economic prospect, therefore, is a positive one.
The Third Five-Year Development Plan represents an ambitious step forward. It maps out a realistic sequence for a
balanced liberalisation of Iran's economy. The aim of increasing growth to 6% per annum, from an average of 2.5%
between 1997-2000, should generate employment opportunities for the growing labour force and help to raise living
standards. The plan aims to promote growth through privatisation and liberalisation, and to enhance stability by further
encouraging diversification of the economy. Macro-economic policies under the plan are aimed at fiscal consolidation to
help reduce inflation, broadening the tax base (including the introduction of VAT), and unifying exchange rates at a
market-determined level. Exchange controls will be further loosened. And it is planned that price distortions due to state
subsidies will also decline. These are ambitious and wide-ranging plans and the key is now implementation.
The climate for business investment in Iran has steadily improved over the past decade, in particular following the
election of President Khatami in 1997, as the process of liberalisation has accelerated. There has already been progress
with privatisation, especially in the hydrocarbon industry. There are plans to restructure and privatise over 500 state
enterprises during the next 5 years, and to commercialise - or "autonomise" - Iran's state-owned banking system. Trade
and foreign investment are being encouraged by the extension of Iran's free-trade zones. And new legislation is
expected soon to simplify and clarify the Law for the Encouragement and Protection of Foreign Investment. These are all
clearly positive steps.
Iran is, of course, OPEC's second largest producer and has the second largest reserves of gas in the world. It has
benefited from the recent rise in oil prices and is playing a positive role in promoting the stability of the oil market.
President Khatami recently noted that OPEC may need to raise output in proportion to the increase in global oil demand
to stabilise prices.
The government has taken positive steps to encourage foreign investment in the petroleum sector. For example, they
have facilitated foreign participation in contracts to redevelop oil fields, and they have also signed an agreement with a
consortium of nine leading international oil and gas companies to study Iran's potential as an exporter of gas.
The government is, moreover, actively seeking to cushion the economy from future fluctuations in the oil price.
Establishing an Oil Stabilisation Fund, which ensures that the government balance sheet is strengthened when oil price
movements are favourable, should help insure against the type of debt servicing problems faced by many emerging

market economies during the difficult international environment of 1997-98. Iran was able to maintain an excellent debt
service record through this period, and prudent debt management policies should help preserve this record going
forward. Total external debt is expected to decline to around 10% of GDP this year, and short-term debt to only about
40% of reserves, having fallen from around 65% in 1999/2000. The strong external position has encouraged the World
Bank to approve loans of some $230 million this year. Importantly, it should hold Iran in good stead in attracting inflows
of private capital, which are so crucial to a country's long term growth prospects.
The international financial crises of 1997-98 stemmed largely from vulnerabilities within countries' financial systems. In
the aftermath of the crises, the official community has been assisting the financial sectors in emerging market economies
through technical assistance and improved surveillance. This has been an area of notable success in the redesign of the
international financial architecture.
A key step in this regard has been the joint IMF-World Bank initiative of Financial Sector Assessment Programs, or
FSAPs. The FSAP process is designed to identify and assess strengths and weaknesses in financial systems from a
best practice standpoint including: assessing financial institutions' structure and soundness; reviewing systemic risks in
payment systems; examining the legal framework and the system of official oversight and prudential regulation and
supervision; and assessing institutional arrangements for crisis management, including financial safety nets. Iran is
addressing these aspects of the financial infrastructure and, in formulating and implementing their reform programme,
Iran has maintained a constructive engagement with the IFIs. I am particularly pleased that the Bank of England will be
involved with an IMF-World Bank led technical assistance team on financial sector restructuring and supervisory and
regulatory frameworks for banks in Iran during the coming year.
Another key element of efforts to strengthen the international financial architecture has been the development and
implementation of a range of international standards or codes of good practice. These codes are not meant to lay down
strict or inflexible rules. They are designed, however, to promote best practices, while recognising that financial systems
are likely to differ across countries and across time. The IMF and the World Bank, working together with the relevant
standard-setting bodies, have been helping economies undertake assessments of their observance of some of these
standards.
Iran is currently working towards the adoption of internationally accepted best practice standards in a number of areas.
The central bank is developing a new bank accounting framework, which represents a move towards international
accounting standards, while taking account of the special features of Islamic finance. The authorities are also developing
an action plan for implementing supervision reforms. These developments ought to be good news for prospective
investors in Iran. They also help illustrate that international best practice standards can be flexible enough to
accommodate individual country circumstances.
The move to a more market-oriented environment brings with it new challenges. For example, liberalising exchange
controls and freeing the exchange rate to market forces brings risks as well as opportunities. A sequenced approach to
capital account liberalisation helps mitigate these risks and that is the route Iran has pursued. But that is not to say
reform has stalled.
Since mid-1999, the central bank has taken important steps to improve and simplify the foreign exchange market,
including allowing the exchange rate to depreciate to market clearing levels. In March 2000, requirements to surrender
non-oil export receipts to the central bank were abolished. The intention now is to introduce a direct, interbank foreign
exchange market, and to eliminate an advance import deposit requirement by March 2001. These will be important
further steps in increasing Iran's exposure to international competition which in turn can contribute to its productive
efficiency.
Exchange rate unification and the partial liberalisation of trade and exchange controls will make greater demands on the
effectiveness of monetary policy. For example, monetary expansion may arise from the phased reduction in banks'
reserve requirements. It will be important for the central bank to develop effective monetary instruments to sterilise the
monetary impact of these reforms, and support the central bank's target for inflation. The issuance of CDs, together with
the partial liberalisation of credit allocation, are all sensible and commendable steps. And I know that the central bank is
actively considering additional possibilities. These measures will make for a financial system in Iran that is more efficient,
liquid and transparent - and thereby more attractive to potential market entrants.
Mr Chairman, economic progress in any one country is not just a question of that country's national interest, it is - in
today's increasingly economically and financially integrated world - a matter of collective, international, interest. That is
true both at the macro- and at the micro-economic level - the level of individual businesses and firms. That's why I think it
is important that we encourage the forces working for reform and liberalisation by engaging constructively with them. Iran
has embarked upon an ambitious, but realistically measured, programme of reform and liberalisation through the Third
Five-Year Development Plan, and it is taking advantage of the present more favourable conditions in the world economy
