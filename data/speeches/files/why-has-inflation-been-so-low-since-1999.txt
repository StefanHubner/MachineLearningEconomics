Why Has Inflation Been So Low Since 1999?
Summary
1. Inflation on the CPI measure has been below the present target level (2%,
introduced at the beginning of 2004) since 1999, averaging 1.2% over this period.
2. Since mid-1999, while CPI service prices have been rising at over 3% per annum,
CPI goods prices have been falling. It is this factor which has underpinned the low
level of overall inflation. By contrast, goods price inflation in the Eurozone, using the
same measure, has been around 2% per annum.
3. Consumer goods sold in the UK are either produced domestically or imported.
Since 1999, there have been three distinct inflationary periods. From 1999 to early
2001 both domestic and imported goods prices were rising. Despite this, retail goods
prices were falling during this period because of the fall in margins in the distribution
sector.
4. From early 2001 to late 2002, both domestic and imported goods prices were
falling and this deflation was passed on to retail goods prices. From late 2002 to the
present, domestic goods price inflation has been rising but this has been more than
offset by falling import prices and strong distribution sector productivity growth,
which has kept retail goods prices falling.
5. So while falling margins in the distribution sector were important in the early part
of the period, falling import prices have been a key factor more recently. Since 2000,
the process of switching to cheaper sources of supply has, by itself, cut more than Â½
percentage point per annum off import price inflation.
6. Looking to the future, there seems no reason why domestic goods price inflation
will fall significantly below current levels and, very recently, it appears that imported
goods prices have stopped falling. The continued strength of the world economy will
imply further upward pressure on the world prices of traded goods which suggests
that this recent turn round in import prices will not reverse and that import prices will
start to rise. Overall, this indicates that we are entering a period when both domestic
and imported goods prices are going to rise. So, unless there is a further squeeze on
distribution margins, it seems likely that CPI goods price inflation will move into
positive territory, settling down at a relatively low but positive level. This is
consistent with CPI inflation moving close to target over the next couple of years.
7. There are, however, many uncertainties. On the up-side, the tightness of the labour
market may drive up labour costs, and hence domestically produced goods prices,
faster than we expect. On the other hand, more extensive switching towards cheaper
suppliers in world markets may exert further downward pressure on imported goods
prices keeping CPI goods price inflation in negative territory.

1. Introduction
Towards the end of last year, Richard Lambert gave a fascinating speech on low
inflation in the UK (Lambert, 2004). This is a sequel.

Back in 2002, the MPC was criticised for undershooting the RPIX inflation target
over the previous three years (see Figure 1) and it was suggested that it had a
deflationary bias, setting interest rates unnecessarily high. In Nickell (2002), this
accusation was analysed. The overall conclusion was that the undershooting had
arisen, in the main, because the MPC, along with all other forecasters, had under
predicted the sterling exchange rate over much of the period from the foundation of
the MPC in 1997 to 2001 (see Figure 2 for the consensus forecasts of that era). This
tended to generate an over prediction of import prices and therefore inflation over the
same period and hence to interest rates being set marginally too high from an ex-post
perspective. I concluded that it would be hard to convict the MPC of a deliberate
deflationary bias simply on these grounds.

After late 2002, this issue went away as RPIX inflation moved above target (see
Figure 1) where it remained until the target was changed to 2% on the CPI measure in
December 2003. However, this question of deflationary bias looks as if it is starting
to make a comeback (see, for example, para.48 in House of Lords, 20041 ). In fact, the
House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs was referring back to the old
question of the pre-2003 period. However given that CPI inflation has been well
below 2% both since it assumed its target role and for many years previously (see
Figure 1), the issue of inflation being persistently below target is very likely to come
back on the agenda.

As is well known, CPI inflation is likely to be around 0.8 percentage points below
RPIX inflation in the long run (see Nickell, 2003, for a detailed analysis of the switch
in target). Much of this long-run difference (0.5 percentage points) is down to the
different formulae used to aggregate the inflation rates of all the different goods. But
the remaining 0.3 percentage points of the long-run difference is due to the exclusion
of housing depreciation and Council Tax from CPI. While the long-run impact of this
exclusion is relatively small, in the short run it can, and recently has had, a very
substantial effect on the difference between CPI and RPIX inflation. Indeed, because
of the fact that the housing depreciation element of RPIX is based on house price
inflation, throughout 2003 RPIX inflation was significantly above target whereas CPI
1

inflation was below its subsequent target. During this period the difference between
the two measures of inflation was well over 1 percentage point.

The interesting fact that comes out of all this and is worth looking at in more detail is
that CPI inflation, that is general consumer price inflation excluding housing costs,
has been very low for most of the time since the late 1990s. Indeed, its average rate
since 1999 has been 1.2%. Trying to understand why this has happened is important,
particularly as the MPC projection of the most likely path of CPI inflation moves
above 2% by the end of 2006.

In what follows, we first split inflation into CPI goods and CPI services, concluding
that low CPI inflation since 1999 is mainly accounted for by the fact that CPI goods
prices have been falling over most of the period. This is particularly unusual in the
sense that over the same period, using the same measure, average goods price
inflation in the Eurozone has been close to 2%. This during a period when the
sterling-euro exchange rate was much the same at the end of the period as it was at the
beginning.

In Section 3 we analyse the factors driving the prices of domestically produced goods
and in Section 4 we focus on imported goods prices. Having understood the
determinants of goods prices at the factory gate and the port of entry, in Section 5 we
investigate the retail distribution sector which turns goods at the port and factory gate
into goods at retail outlets. These three sections give us an overview of the reasons
why goods inflation has been so low. Then, in Section 6, we pursue things a little
further by investigating which sectors have made the biggest contribution to falling
goods prices. We conclude by asking which inflationary pressures now in the
pipeline are consistent with an MPC central projection where CPI inflation moves
above the 2% target in 2006?

2. CPI Inflation: Goods and Services

If we are to understand why CPI inflation has been so low in recent years, the first
step is to divide CPI into goods and services. In Figure 3, we see the significant gap
between CPI goods and service price inflation. Furthermore, it is clear that the low
level of inflation since 1999 is being driven by the fact that throughout most of this
period, CPI goods prices have been falling. It is this fact which we shall investigate
further2 . To do this we look at the various stages from the production or import of
2

goods to their appearance in consumer outlets. So we analyse successively, the prices
of domestically produced goods at the factory gate, the prices of imported goods, and
the operation of the distribution sector which buys goods from the factory gate or the
port and sells them in retail outlets at prices which determine the CPI goods price
index.

Starting with home produced and imported goods, a broad overview of inflation is
provided in Figure 4. What we see is that home produced goods price inflation has
been positive for the majority of the time since 1999. Furthermore, if we remove
petroleum products, which add a lot of noise to the series as oil prices fluctuate, we
see in Figure 4 that home produced goods inflation has been rising steadily since
2000, turning from negative to positive in 2001. In fact, we would have a very similar
picture were we simply to look at home produced consumer goods. Imported goods
price inflation, on the other hand, has been negative for much of the period, notably
since mid-2001. So we can see from this that imported goods have made a significant
contribution to the low level of CPI goods price inflation in recent years. The next
step is to look at domestic and imported goods price inflation in more detail.

3. Domestic Goods Prices

Our purpose here is to analyse the forces driving domestic production costs and hence
output prices. The overall picture is summarised in Figure 5. Since the late 1990s,
domestic output price inflation has broadly follo wed cost inflation until 2003 since
when it is clear that (domestic) margins have been gradually increasing. The biggest
element of production costs is labour costs and in Figure 6, we see the broad stability
of both manufacturing pay growth and pay settlements. This, despite the fact that the
unemployment rate over the period from the late 1990s has been slowly falling to its
lowest level for a generation. The factors underlying this rather favourable
performance are discussed in Nickell and Quintini (2002) and include the following.
First, the continuing decline in adversarial trade unionism in the private sector, where
less than 20% of employees are now unionised. Second, increased product market
competition in the manufacturing sector. Third, the increasing stability of inflation
expectations, so that short-run fluctuations in the cost of living are less likely to be
transmitted into pay settlements. Finally, in some sectors, notably agriculture and
food processing, labour shortages are resolved by the selective use of immigrant
labour rather then by increasing pay rates.

3

One further factor influencing recent pay awards is the question: which index of
overall price inflation is used as the key measure of the cost of living increase when
negotiating pay rises. Since the end of 2003, the CPI measure has been used by the
MPC for its inflation target. So is there any evidence that private sector pay
negotiators have switched to this significantly lower measure in 2004? The answer
appears to be no. There is no indication that private sector pay settlements have
declined over this period (see Figure 6). Furthermore, in the surveys reported in the
IDS Pay Report 917 and in the IRS Pay and Benefits Bulletin 603 (both dated
November 2004), the clear result is that private sector employers are sticking to the
traditional RPI measure. (See Nickell, 2003 for a discussion of the labour market
consequences of the switch in the MPC target measures of inflation in December
2003).

The impact of wage inflation on labour costs depends crucially on labour productivity
growth which, in the manufacturing sector, has been relatively strong since 1999. In
Figure 7, we see how this strong growth in labour productivity has ensured that, on
average, unit labour cost growth has been negative since 1999 (average = -0.3% pa).
The other main items in the costs of domestic goods production are materials and fuel
and business services. In Figure 8, we see that annual business services inflation has
been relatively stable, fluctuating between 0 and 4%. By contrast, the annual inflation
rate of materials and fuels prices ranges from -10 to +8% and the surge in the cost of
materials and fuels in the period from 1999 to 2001, on the back of the world boom,
was one of the main reasons for the high levels of manufacturing cost inflation in the
same period.

Overall, therefore, we see that the combination of stable wage inflation and relatively
buoyant labour productivity growth have helped to hold down domestic goods price
inflatio n. On the other hand, inflation in the cost of business services and rapidly
rising inflation in the cost of materials and fuels have contributed to the burst in
domestic goods price inflation in 1999 and 2000 as well as its steady rise since 2002.
On top of this the increase in margins has had a significant impact over the last 18
months.

4. Imported Goods Prices

As we saw in Figure 4, imported goods prices have been falling for much of the time
since 2001. In contrast to domestic goods prices, the sterling exchange rate plays a
4

direct role 3 in the determination of imported goods prices because the cost of
producing these goods is incurred in foreign currency, so the sterling cost of
productio n depends on the exchange rate. In Figure 9, we see that the sterling
exchange rate appreciated dramatically in 1996-7 by over 20% after which it has
remained relatively stable. The initial appreciation had a significant negative impact
on import price inflation for a number of years and helps to explain why import prices
continued to fall rapidly until 1999. Since that time, the direct effect of the
fluctuations in the sterling exchange rate has been relatively modest, although the
small surge in import price inflation in 2003 and the subsequent fall back in 2004 was
probably driven, at least partially, by exchange rate shifts.

In order to understand what determines the price of imported goods, the starting point
is the export prices of the various countries who provide UK imports. To construct an
index of export prices appropriate to the UK, the standard strategy is to convert these
export prices into sterling and then weight them by the share of imports from each
country. So if pxi is the log of the price of exports in sterling from country i and Î»i is
the share of UK imports from country i, then the (log) price index would be
p x = â Î»i p xi
i

A sterling index of UK weighted world export price inflation, âp x , would be given by
âp x = â Î»i âp xi + â (âÎ»i ) p xi
i

(1)

i

where âp xi is export price inflation from country i in sterling terms and âÎ»i is the
change in the weight attached to country i. The reason for going through this rather
tedious algebra is to bring out the simple fact that UK weighted world export price
inflation consists of two parts, the first term on the right-hand side of (1) which is the
weighted average of the export price inflation rates of the different countries, and the
second term which is the impact arising from shifts in import shares, generally
towards countries which produce cheaper goods. This second term is potentially
important. For example, between 1999 and 2002, imports to the UK from China and
India increased their share by nearly 1.1 percentage points. This does not seem very
much, but average prices in these countries are around one quarter of those from
developed countries, for example. This apparent small shift in import shares is
enough to reduce UK weighted world export price inflation by around 0.5% per
annum during the three year period.

5

To see how this works in practice, we present in Figure 10, the series of UK weight
world export price inflation based on the 27 main trading partners4 and then in Figure
11, the contribution to this series made by the continuing process of switching to
cheaper countries. The broad picture in Figure 10 is, not surprisingly, similar to the
pattern of import price inflation shown in Figure 4. Even taking account of the fact
that the former figure is based on annual data whereas the latter is based on monthly
data, they are not identical because the average export prices of a particular country
are not the same as the prices of imports into the UK from that country. This is first,
because the composition of UK imports from a given country are not the same as the
average composition of exports from that country and second because, even for
identical goods, exports from a given country are often sold at different prices in
different countries.

We see in Figure 11 that switching to cheaper countries has reduced UK weighted
world export price inflation by an average of only 0.14 percentage points per annum
in the second half of the 1990s. However, since 2000, this has risen to an average of
0.55 percentage points per annum which is a significant amount, suggesting that the
process of sourcing manufactured goods from cheaper countries has intensified since
the turn of the century5 .

So far, we have only considered overall goods import prices which include raw
materials and oil, among other things. In order to look at a combination of goods
somewhat closer to those relevant to consumption price indices, we present in Figure
12 the inflation rate of imported finished manufactures. Again, it exhibits the same
broad pattern as the import price index in Figure 4, although the annual inflation rate
for finished manufactures does not go positive in 2004. So what we see is that over
the period from 1999 to 2001, import price inflation for finished manufactures was
positive but since that time it has been falling at an average rate of over 2 percentage
points per annum.

If we combine this with the inflation rate of domestically produced goods, we have
the following picture of goods price inflation before they hit the retail distribution
sector. From 1999 to early 2001, the annual inflation rate of both domestically
produced and imported finished manufactures was positive. From early 2001 to mid2002 both these inflation rates were generally negative. By contrast, from mid-2002
onwards, the inflation rate of domestically produced goods has been positive but this
has been offset by the falling prices of imported finished manufactures. In the next
6

section we investigate how these prices have been translated into retail goods prices
by the distribution sector.

5. Retail Prices and the Distribution Sector

Before we proceed, it is important to note that the goods prices we have been talking
about so far, that is the price of domestically produced goods and imported finished
manufactures, do not match precisely the goods included in retail goods price indices.
The former include not only consumer goods but also intermediate goods and
investment goods. Of course, ultimately even the intermediate and capital goods are
used, either directly or indirectly in the production of consumer goods, so price
inflation in these former goods will feed through into consumer price inflation. So,
generally speaking, inflation rates in the price of some of the domestically produced
and imported goods will be transmitted into inflation in the prices of inputs into the
retail distribution sector with some delay.

The retail distribution sector can be thought of as taking goods from the factory gate
and from ports, transporting them to retail outlets6 and selling them to the general
public. Inflation rates of goods going in differ from inflation rates of goods coming
out if trend productivity growth in retail distribution changes or if margins in retail
distribution are systematically squeezed or increased. The retail distribution sector
consists of wholesale, retail and the motor trade. In terms of gross output, retail
expanded from about 37% of the sector in the late 1990s to around 40% in 2002 and
wholesale contracted from around 45% of the sector in the late 1990s to around 43%
in 2002. During this same period, retail expanded its share of the total gross operating
surplus in the sector from around 48% to 57% whereas wholesaleâs share of the total
gross operating surplus fell from around 37% to 28%. So we have a picture here of a
slowly expanding retail sector managing systematically to squeeze profits out of a
slowly contracting wholesale sector. In Figure 13, we see how this translates into
margins in the retail distribution sector, using two measures. Two facts stand out.
First margins in the wholesale sector have been falling from the late 1990s onwards.
Second, if we look at the margins in the entire retail distribution sector, we see that
they fell from the late 1990s to 2000 after which they have been more or less flat, at
least up to 2003.

What about productivity growth in the retail distribution sector? What we see in
Figure 14 is that after 1999, average labour productivity growth in both wholesale and
7

retail rose by a little under 2 percentage points per annum and this is reflected in the
similar rise in overall productivity growth in the distribution sector as a whole.

So how does this all tie in with the information on domestic and imported goods price
inflation we discussed in previous sections and the fact that CPI goods prices have
been falling from 1999 (see Figure 3)? In the previous section, we divided the period
since 1999 into three sub-periods. From 1999 to early 2001, the prices of both
domestically produced goods and imported goods were rising. The reason why this
translated into falling CPI goods prices was the fall in the margins in the retail
distribution sector (mainly in wholesale) along with the rise in labour productivity
growth. In the period from early-2001 to mid-2002, domestic and imported goods
prices were generally falling and this ensured that CPI goods prices continued to fall.
Finally, in the period from mid-2002 onwards, domestically produced goods prices
were rising, the prices of imported manufactures were falling at an average of around
2 percentage points per annum and margins in the retail distribution sector were
relatively stable, at least up to the end of 2003. So the fact that CPI goods prices
continued to fall must have been due to the dominant impact of falling imported
goods prices supported by the continuation of high productivity growth in
distribution. This, then, is the overall explanation of falling goods prices, and hence
of very low inflation over the last five years. There remain two other issues to
discuss. First, it is of some interest to see which goods have made a particular
contribution to falling prices and why. Second, since the MPC expects CPI inflation
to rise above 2% in 2006 for the first time this century, are there any straws in the
wind we can point to now which reinforce this expectation?

6. Which Sectors Have Made the Biggest Contribution to Falling Goods Prices?

In Figure 15 we present a breakdown of the goods part of the retail price index (RPI).
This is very similar to the goods part of the CPI, but since the latter data are not
available for the early 1990s, we are forced to use the RPI. The basic difference
between the two indices is the fact that the CPI goods inflation rate will be somewhat
lower throughout because of the formula effect. The patterns over time, however, will
be much the same.

The first point that emerges from Figure 15 is that overall goods price inflation was
around 2 percentage points lower after 1999 than it was between 1993 and 1999.
Looking at the individual sectors we see substantial differences in the fall in inflation
8

in different sectors. Whereas food price inflation fell by less than 1 percentage point
on average, clothing and footwear inflation fell by over 3 percentage points, car price
inflation by over 4 percentage points and the inflation rate of TVs (including home
computers) fell by a staggering 8 percentage points, although this represents only
1.9% of total goods expenditure. Altogether, however, these last three sectors make
up around one quarter of all goods expenditure.

While these categories cannot be matched precisely to domestic manufacturing
sectors, we set out some roughly equivalent data for domestic output price inflation in
Figure 16. The data that match up particularly well include the small fall in output
price inflation in food products and the large falls in clothing and footwear (over 2
percentage points), motor vehicles (close to 4 percentage points) and TVs (close to 4
percentage points)7 . By contrast, the large fall in alcohol and tobacco output price
inflation does not match up to the small fall in retail price inflation in the same sector,
presumably because retail prices in this sector are dominated by excise duties.
Interestingly enough, from Figure 17, we see how the three sectors with large falls in
inflation noted above are also sectors which have seen significant increases in average
annual labour productivity growth, namely clothing and footwear (12 percentage
points), motor vehicles (around 5 percentage points) and TVs (around 15 percentage
points). However, the big increases in labour productivity growth in domestic
appliances and furniture do not seem to be reflected in large falls in output price or
retail price inflation.

Many of these sectors have high levels of import penetration, so we should also see if
the patterns of import price inflation shed more light on the overall falls in retail
goods price inflation. Again, in Figure 18, we see significant falls in import price
inflation in clothing and footwear (around 2.5 percentage points), new cars (6
percentage points) and TVs (around 3 percentage points) which reinforce the falls we
see in domestically produced goods in these sectors. Interestingly inflation in
beverages and tobacco actually rises in the period after 1999 which helps explain why
retail price inflation in this sector has fallen so little.

Overall, then, we have a picture where some sectors, notably clothing/footwear, cars
and TVs, which cover around one quarter of goods expenditure, have seen large falls
in both domestic and imported inflation and large rises in domestic productivity
growth. These are also sectors which are very open to trade, and so are highly
competitive, which helps to drive productivity growth. On top of this, prices in the
9

car market have fallen because of interventions by the UK and European competition
authorities8 .

7. Looking into the Future

Over the last two years, import price deflation and high productivity growth in the
distribution sector have been holding CPI goods price inflation below zero despite
positive and rising domestic goods price inflation and relatively stable retail
distribution margins (at least until the end of 2003). Looking forward, how long can
this continue?

On the domestic front, there are few factors at the moment which seem likely to
reduce domestic goods price inflation, which has been rising for some years.
Underlying earnings growth in the private sector has been rising over 2004 (see
Figure 19) and the labour market continues to be tight. While manufacturing
productivity growth remains high, there seems no obvious reason why it should rise
further. However, given the intensity of competition, it is quite probable that margins
in manufacturing will stop rising.

Import prices are a key factor. In Figure 4, we see that overall import prices are no
longer falling. However, annual inflation of the price of imported finished
manufactures remains negative as we can see from Figure 12. On the othe r hand, in
this same figure, we see that the three- month on three- month rate has recently been
positive, indicating that these import prices are no longer falling.

Looking forward, the continued strength of the world economy implies upward
pressure on the world prices of traded goods. This suggests that the recent turn round
in import prices will not reverse and that import prices will continue rising. With the
continuing rise in domestic goods prices, this indicates that we are about to enter a
period when both domestic and imported goods prices are rising. The last time this
happened (1999 to 2001), the inflationary pressure was offset by falling margins in
the retail distribution sector, so it was not transmitted to CPI goods prices. Given the
recent stability of distribution sector margins (see Figure 13), there seems no
particular reason to expect a repeat of this via a further squeeze on distribution
margins. So we can expect CPI goods price inflation to move into positive territory,
settling down at a stable but relatively low level. This is consistent with the latest
MPC central projection where inflation settles down close to the target.
10

Of course, there are many uncertainties. The tightness of the labour market may drive
up labour costs and hence domestic goods prices faster than we expect. On the other
hand, even when the world prices of traded goods are rising, more extensive
switching towards cheaper suppliers can still generate falling import prices thereby
continuing to keep CPI goods price inflation in negative territory. Nevertheless, for
the reasons discussed above, a projection of CPI inflation moving up towards 2% in
the next couple of years is not implausible despite its having been below this level for
several years.

In fact, para.48 says, âThese data prompt some intriguing questions. If
inflation was over-predicted until 2003, should interest rates have been
lower? Moreover, did the over-prediction of growth over this period lead to
higher interest rates than were necessary? And was this whole situation
reversed from 2003 onwards? Interest rates were above 6.75% until 2001.
With the fall in the growth of GDP interest rates were then reduced. Interest
rates were then raised again during 2002 when both inflation and growth
were being over-predicted.â The factual details here are a bit puzzling
because interest rates peaked at 6% in 2000, having risen during 1999.
Furthermore, they did not rise again until late 2003. So, contrary to the
statement in para.48, they were not raised during 2002.

What we are, in fact, investigating is why goods prices have been falling
relative to the general price level so much faster after 1999 than in previous
years. It is rather casual to refer to this fact as the driving force behind the
low level of CPI inflation. Ultimately inflation is the consequence of
monetary policy and macroeconomic shocks. So here, we are not analysing
the ultimate causal mechanisms but merely looking at why the relative price
of goods has been falling so rapidly in recent years.

3.

The sterling exchange rate has an indirect impact on the price of domestically
produced goods because domestic firms are often directly competing with
foreign firms in the domestic market. If sterling appreciates, the sterling cost
of production for foreign firms falls and this enables them to compete more
fiercely in the domestic market which may force domestic firms to cut their
prices in order to maintain market share.

We omit Norway and Saudi Arabia to concentrate more on non-oil imports.

Computing the switching effect is not straightforward because a measure of
the level of export prices is required for each country. In Figure 11 we use
data from the Penn World Tables and the IMF to estimate the relative price
levels.

2000 and highlighted âa complex monopoly situation resulting from suppliers
practices in distributing new cars in the UKâ. The EC rules which allowed
this to happen (the so-called Block Exemption) were adjusted in July 2002 but
the UK car market had already changed significantly by then as a result of the
investigations by the competition authorities and the consequent introduction
in the UK of the Supply of New Cars Order 2000 in September.

Notes: (i) The distribution sector includes the Wholesale, Retail and Motor Trade industries. (ii) Margins in the Motor Trade industry have been relatively
stable throughout (iii) Margins in 13a are defined by gross operating surplus divided by output at basic prices (iv) Margins in 13b are defined by gross
operating surplus divided by gross output, where gross output = intermediate inputs + compensation of employees + taxes on production + gross operating
surplus. The difference between output at basic prices and gross output is that in the former, goods which are not processed in any way within the
distribution sector are subtracted out.
