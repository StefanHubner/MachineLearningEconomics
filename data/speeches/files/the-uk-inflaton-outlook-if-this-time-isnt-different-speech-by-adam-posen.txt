I would like to thank - without implicating - my colleagues on the MPC, as well as Chris Carroll, Joe Gagnon, Ken Kuttner, Neil
Meads, and David Romer for enlightening discussion of these issues. Tomas Hellebrandt provided excellent research
assistance and much helpful input. The views expressed here are solely my own, and not those of the MPC, the Bank, or of
PIIE.

Thank you for having me here to share in your pre-Christmas cheer this morning. Even discounting what I‟ve
learnt from watching “The Only Way is Essex,” it is a pleasant surprise to see so many people out and
interested in discussing economics on a winter morning. I gather that usually at this event there is some
discussion of members‟ predictions, and I look forward to hearing yours for the New Year. In that spirit, I
would like to offer a forecast of my own for inflation in the UK, but at a slightly longer two- to three-year
horizon, since that is the medium-term over which the Monetary Policy Committee‟s [MPC] inflation target is
to be achieved. Given a series of above target recent readings on CPI inflation for the British economy, this
is a good time for members of the MPC - and for the public to which we are accountable - to think critically
about what is the right forecast. For an inflation targeting central bank, like the Bank of England, monetary
policy should follow directly from the medium-term forecast (barring the rare kind of rapidly evolving crisis we
experienced in 2008-09).

The first point I want to make is that neither our forecast nor our policy going forward should overreact
reflexively to that above target inflation, even though it will persist for the next few months after the coming
VAT rise. As much as we may be tempted to demonstrate to the public or to markets how upset we are
about being above target, we have to take the right lesson from our mistakes and try to forecast better in
future – we help no one in this economy by getting our forecast incorrect, or worse, by setting our policy to
compensate for past mistakes rather than basing it on our best forecast.

As I said to the Treasury Select Committee last month (Posen 2010d), the persistently above target CPI
inflation the UK economy is experiencing is almost entirely due to the combination of the depreciation of
1

Sterling prior to January 2009 and the increase in VAT in January 2010. As a committee, our forecast
underestimated the size and particularly the persistence of these inflationary effects, and I accept my share
of responsibility for that mistake. The lesson we need to take therefore is to update our estimates of
transmission from external shocks going forward. That said, annual inflation in the UK as measured in the
CPIY series, which excludes the price effect of indirect taxes, has been below target throughout this calendar
year. Thus, if we allow for even just some exchange rate pressure upwards on prices over this period as
well, underlying UK inflation has stayed well below target. Recognizing that fact has to be the starting point
for our forecast.

This is not to dismiss the harmful impact of the past months of higher inflation on the vast majority of British
citizens. British households do suffer from increases in consumption taxes and in import costs, as well as
from inflation more generally. What British households have suffered in this regard over the last year,
however, is a decline in their purchasing power due to one-time factors that is neither amenable to reversal
through monetary policy nor going to feed a more general rise in prices and wages. The MPC would only
make things worse by making policy looking in the rear-view mirror, trying to make up for past mistakes,
especially given the fact that the underlying trend inflation rate is below target. In particular, the MPC should

(2010), Fisher (2010), and Posen (2010b).

not tighten in response to the inherently temporary effects on measured CPI inflation of a VAT increase,
when it is essentially equivalent to a payroll tax increase in short-term impact, and thus a fiscal policy
tightening, that just is labeled differently.

2

Moreover, both the MPC and the British public should maintain some perspective on the size of our inflation
forecast error given the magnitude of the shocks to which the UK economy has been subjected. That is not
an excuse, but a reality check. I think both the Bank of England and the public gained an exaggerated
confidence over the NICE decade of 1997-2007 about just how finely the MPC could both forecast and
control inflation. We can still control inflation over the medium-term, but the degree of extreme predictability
seen then was due not just to the good policy regime, but was also partly due to good luck in terms of the
absence of major shocks, and thus was misleading. The Federal Reserve, another central bank coming off a
fortunately stable period, also only in part due to good monetary policy, has also gotten its inflation forecasts
wrong of late on a similar scale, albeit having US inflation come in below expectations.

Given an appropriate degree of humility about our ability to forecast inflation, and the right mindset to keep
looking forward by learning from past errors (rather than doing harm by trying to make up for them), how
should we make our inflation forecast? To me, the right way to think about it is to consider what has
happened to the UK and other similar economies when they have been in post-financial crisis situations like
the one we are in now. As an already classic recent book (Reinhart and Rogoff (2010)) reminds us,
economic policymakers as well as investors get into trouble when they arrogantly say “this time is different.”
If anything, part of the reason the UK and other western economies got into the difficulties we have been in
is because many of us assumed this time was different during the mid-2000s boom.
Yet, the UK situation today shares many important parallels with other advanced economies‟ experiences in
the last few decades, and it behooves us to learn from those precedents. Put differently, I would rather look
at several cases, or even better try to draw conclusions statistically from a large sample, and try to take into
account the specific conditions of the UK economy at present, than to just leap to conclusions from our
current indicators or from comparison with one or two prior UK recessions. In fact, the experience of the last
couple of UK recessions which came about due to monetary tightening, not as the result of a financial crisis,
may be more different in nature from today‟s situation than other economies‟ post financial crisis
experiences, and thus be misleading as a guide to policy.

As I pointed out in Posen (2010c), if one plots the course of our current recovery versus that of the UK from
recession in 1992 and that of Japan from its initial recession in 1993, one can discern no significant
3

divergence between them. And we all know what terrible things happened to Japan after 1993, and both
credit and fiscal developments in the UK today look a lot more like Japan then than the UK at the same time.
My point is not, and never has been, that the UK now is just like Japan in the 1990s – my argument has

always been that Japan‟s problems in the 1990s did not arise from Japan being different, but are best
understood as something that could happen to other major economies faced with similar shocks and given
similar policy responses (just as Japan‟s lost decade paralleled the 1930s in the US in key ways).

4

Unfortunately, on some critical aspects that similarity currently is playing out in a number of countries,
including the UK. One cannot simply compare the UK recovery today solely to its own of the early 1990s
and draw any reliable conclusions. So today, I will show you some analyses which I think provide a better
basis for forecasting what is likely to happen to UK inflation over the next couple of years, based on my and
others‟ research on these kind of cross-national comparisons.

We on the MPC are faced with some observers who recommend that we make our forecast by looking
primarily at the better than expected recent data, supposedly without preconceptions (or with the assumption
that this time is different). Advocates of this view are skeptical of macroeconomists‟ models, and take very
seriously the fact that growth and inflation both come in above forecasts using those models over the last few
quarters of data. To me, such an approach means treating the few months of good news on some indicators
such as exports and (relatively speaking) employment, as well as anecdotes about successful individual UK
businesses, as highly significant, and just extrapolating them forward. This kind of short-term data focus
without interpretation, however, is short-sighted at best. Data is meaningless without some kind of
5

benchmark and reasoning behind that benchmark by which to judge developments. Yes, economic models
(which should be seen as a way of summarizing and explaining such a benchmark) need to be confronted
with hard empirical data, and if they are proven wrong, discarded. But that must not be done on the basis of
getting too excited by short-term blips in economic outcomes, especially when there is not a realistic let
alone established story to explain those blips.

Let me offer two analogies to illustrate the point. As my accent reveals, I used to live in the United States.
Many politicians and pundits there are in absurd denial about global warming. Every time we had a bad
winter, or even a few cool days in summer, those deniers would announce, „see, the temperature is not
trending up!‟ Of course, such short-term fluctuations say nothing about the underlying long-term trend of
global warming. In fact, some of the better developed models that try to understand the forces behind global
warming even predict that we should see more short-term fluctuations in weather, and more out-of-season
temperatures in both directions, as a result of the underlying process. The deniers‟ interpretation looking
backwards at a few weeks‟ or months‟ temperature outcomes was profoundly wrong, and would have been a
harmful basis on which to make climate policy going forward.

Turning inwards, as part of my assimilation to the UK, I have tried to follow Premier League Football (I live 15
minutes walk from Emirates Stadium, so I am disappointed by the latest ManU-Arsenal result). Earlier this
season, both Bolton and Newcastle had runs of success, while Liverpool was doing awfully. Had I taken too
seriously these teams exceeding (or failing to meet) expectations over the first few games of the season, and

thereby assumed that this time was different, I might have been tempted to run down to my nearest betting
shop and wager that at season‟s end Newcastle would challenge for the title or that Liverpool would be
relegated. As you know better than I do, these would have been quite foolish bets, given the long-term
patterns and determinants of success in English football. Of course, it was possible that something
fundamental had changed either for one of these teams, or even in the nature of competition in the
Premiership overall. But it was highly unlikely, and without a good story or set of reasons to explain why it
should be different, and with expert opinion believing that the fundamentals largely were unchanged, I was
6

right not to place my bet that way. As the season has played out, a fundamentals based forecast that
Newcastle would be a little improved but not a rival to the top teams, and that Liverpool would have a less
good than usual season but be in no danger of relegation, has proven correct. So it should be for the
forecasting of inflation in the UK economy.

One more point before getting into the forecast itself. I want to be clear that I am talking today about my own
central forecast for inflation in 2012-13 – solely my own, and not necessarily any other member of the
7

MPC‟s ; and central, meaning the outcome I expect on average. This latter point is important to note. The
argument I am making today for my forecast is not dependent upon scary perhaps low probability „downside
risks‟, or even the kind of negative feedback dynamic from insufficient growth to contracting potential that I
discussed in Posen (2010c), though I believe both are relevant to the UK outlook today. Nor, as I will
discuss, is my inflation forecast dependent upon some speculative assumption about the Bank‟s credibility,
and it certainly is not motivated by a desire to make up for past inflation forecasting mistakes by erring on the
upside. Once we rightly (to my mind) assume that this time isn‟t different for the UK, it follows logically that
my central forecast is that headline CPI inflation will be well below the MPC‟s inflation target two years‟ from
8

now. Events, including in commodities markets and the euro area, could overtake this or any inflation
forecast (as outlined in Bean (2010)), but on balance, that is where I think the UK economy will be at our
target horizon.
Empirical Regularity 1: Employment Affects Inflation at 1-2 Year Horizons –

Most macroeconomists, especially policymaking economists, tend to focus a lot of attention on the deviation
of national output from its long-run growth trend, and of unemployment from its estimated full-employment
level. Even inflation targeting central bankers do this because the degree of spare capacity in output and
labor plays a huge role in determining subsequent inflation movements. Every so often, some economic
pundits will insist that the Phillips Curve relationship between short-run output/employment and inflation
developments no longer holds, or that the NAIRU (or natural rate of unemployment) is a misleading concept
at best, or that output gaps are useless for policymaking. This is one of the primary and recurring ways in
6

For the record, I don‟t actually bet on football or anything else, although my wife and I have lottery tickets.
As noted in Posen (2010d) and Bank of England (2010), our latest Inflation Report, at present my view differs from the one held by the
majority of the MPC.
8
To pick a number, at least 0.5% below and probably closer to twice that. Of course, that is just the central forecast and I do have a fan
chart in my mind over the range of outcomes.

which economists trying to be clever mistakenly insist that „this time is different.‟ We had people making
claims of this sort in the US during the internet boom of the late 1990s, and during the Japanese bubble of
the late 1980s, and elsewhere. And every time such claims have been proven to be unfounded, even if a few
months of data here or there do deviate from the relationship for some idiosyncratic reason.

9

More plausibly, some economists looking at the UK of late have wondered whether the Phillips Curve might
have flattened. This would mean that while a short-run tradeoff between output or unemployment and
inflation still existed, the amount of inflation movement for a given movement in output (or employment)
would be smaller. Thus, for forecasting purposes, one would still look at output, but put less weight on
movements in it to forecast inflation. As my MPC colleague Charles Bean and others pointed out in the mid2000s, there is evidence that over the last 30 years the UK Phillips Curve has gotten flatter, due to some
combination of monetary policy credibility and globalization.

10

Has it flattened further at this time, so we should put even less emphasis on unemployment (or output) when
forecasting inflation? In Chart 1, I show the relationship in quarterly data between CPIY inflation (excluding
indirect taxes) and unemployment from 2004-present.

11

That is a pretty vertical looking Phillips Curve,

indicating a strong trade-off between employment and inflation for forecasting purposes of late. So I am not
accused of simply focusing on latest data without justification myself, let me explain why this makes
relationship sense to me as consistent with fundamentals. Phillips Curves should be more vertical the more
flexible are prices. In a world with no nominal rigidities, such as long-term wage contracts or catalogue listed
fixed-prices on products for sale, the Phillips Curve should be close to vertical around natural rate of
unemployment. In terms of long-term trends, the weakening of union bargaining power, the move of an
increasing share of product sales to the internet and other IT-based formats allowing rapid repricing, and the
enhanced ability of businesses to hedge cost shocks in financial markets all have reduced nominal rigidities
in recent years. In terms of short-run developments, we know there has been a great deal of wage and hour
flexibility by British workers negotiated with their employers in response to the recession (i.e., fall in GDP,
rise in unemployment) – this shows up clearly in our conversations with business people as well as in the
aggregate data on hours and wages.

Thus, our forecast for UK inflation should take into account a forecast for movements in GDP growth and
unemployment.

See the discussion in Posen (2010c), and Claessens, et al (2009), Fuhrer and Olivei (2010), Liu and Rudebusch (2010), Meier (2010),
and Stock and Watson (2009, 2010).
10
A long line of argument has found it odd that greater monetary credibility is said to lead to a flatter Phillips Curve rather than to a
steeper one. See Debelle and Fisher (1994), Posen (1998b), and Posen and Popov Gould (2007).

The CPIY series only goes back to 2004, hence the limited range of the figure.

Empirical Regularity 2: Large Output Gaps Persist After Financial Crises –

Of course, a reasonably robust relationship between output/employment and inflation is just a starting point.
Taking that for granted, to forecast inflation the next question is whether the economy is running above,
below, or close to capacity. If a large number of productive factors in the economy are unemployed, be they
labor or equipment, to a first approximation the economy can grow faster than its long-run trend without
causing inflation; if the economy is close to or over normal full capacity, in the short-term growing too quickly
will lead to upwards pressure on prices and wages, just as it would for an individual business. Therefore,
when an economy contracts due to a major financial shock, a critical question is how much of the contraction
is due to a collapse in demand, leaving the productive capacity of the economy largely unchanged, and how
much is due to a reduction in supply, meaning the economy would hit capacity constraints sooner.
Relatedly, a negative demand shock would tend to leave the trend rate of growth of which the economy is
capable initially undiminished, whereas a negative supply shock would usually tend to decrease the trend
rate of growth consistent with stable inflation.
In general, what has happened to economies‟ potential capacity in the aftermath of financial crises? The
evidence is that financial crises do tend to reduce supply capacity, but by far less than the total amount of the
decline in actual output experienced, and that the sustainable trend rate of growth is largely undiminished.
Abiad, et al (2009) is a recent cross-national study of output dynamics after banking crises that supports this
characterization based on a large sample of cases. Claessens, et al (2009) and Meier (2010) are other
recent studies consistent with this view. My own work on Japan‟s lengthy Great Recession of the 1990s
(Posen 1998a, 2010a) establishes that in the worst of crisis aftermaths, even if the recession is allowed to
drag on, trend output is largely unaffected, so output gaps tend to persist. In short, financial crises in
advanced economies do not destroy enough productive capacity to offset the disinflationary fall in demand.

For the UK today, this would suggest that a sizable output gap still exists exerting downward pressure on
inflation, all else equal. This is the message of Governor King‟s justly famous line “it‟s the levels, stupid”
(Bank of England (2009)) - that is, that output in the UK is so far below potential if we had grown at trend,
some 10% below, we must still have a sizable output gap even allowing for some decline in supply capacity
and some re-employment of spare capacity and labor over the last year of recovery. This belief, wellfounded in my estimation, underlies the majority of the MPC‟s current forecast that inflation will come down
to close to target in two years‟ time. (Bank of England (2010)). As recently discussed in detail by my MPC
colleagues Charles Bean (2010) and Martin Weale (2010), while there is some uncertainty about the size of
the output gap in the UK at present, we can put a lower bound on estimates that says we are still a good
ways away from full capacity.

12

12

The estimates of the output gap and potential output growth from the Office of Budget Responsibility, for example, are on the low end
of consensus, and even those would imply that we need two years of growth at well above 3% to close the output gap, i.e., before
growth caused inflation on its own. My own estimate, at the high end of consensus, would suggest that the gap is at least 3% of GDP, and
probably above 4%, which means with minimal diminishment in potential trend growth the UK economy could grow faster for longer without
generating inflation from overheating.

Suggestions that the current observations of above target inflation in the UK are due to overheating are to
me misguided examples of focusing too much and too literally on the latest data without a sensible story to
explain it. Not only do such suggestions have to assume no effect on inflation from past VAT and Sterling
movements (otherwise, there is no high inflation to attribute to the supposed overheating). More dubiously,
they also have to argue that this time is different in the UK, and productive capacity was destroyed rapidly in
the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Yet, if anything, the specifics of the UK current case suggest that productive capacity should have declined
even less than usual in a post-crisis situation: unemployment rose by less and corporate liquidations were
fewer for the size of the drop in GDP than in past crises. It is the destruction of human and intellectual as
well as physical capital associated with redundancies and business closings that destroys capacity. As I am
fond of pointing out, the workers of the United Kingdom did not wake up one morning in October 2008 and
find that their left arms had fallen off and half of their offices had disappeared. (Posen (2010c)) Yes, there
are some British business surveys at present that seem to suggest that capacity utilization has increased
faster than we might have expected, and thus imply inflationary pressures from capacity constraints. But,
these surveys are really designed to ask what is the number of businesses who feel capacity utilization is
rising or falling, not to get precise measures of the amount of capacity remaining; accordingly, these surveys
will tend to be misleading in times when utilization has moved quickly far away from normal levels, as in fact
has happened here.

13

As comprehensively assessed in Lui, et al (2011a and b), the predictive power for

economic outcomes of these business surveys is limited for quantitative (as opposed to directional)
forecasting.

Thus, our forecast for UK inflation should start with the assumption that output is well below potential and the
inflation we are experiencing is due to shocks, not overheating.

Empirical Regularity 3: Private Consumption Contracts in the Medium-Term During Fiscal
Consolidations –

The next step for our inflation forecast for the UK two-plus years out is to think about what will happen to
output growth in the next year or two. There is a recovery underway, currently fuelled by a combination of
fiscal and monetary stimulus and (partly as a result) strong consumption, with recovery in investment lagging
somewhat behind.

14

We can hope that net exports continue to pick up, given strong growth in Germany and

the US. The largest change to the economy over the next couple of years, however, is likely to be the fiscal
consolidation of upwards of 1.5% of GDP a year through a combination of spending and benefits cuts and
some tax increases. It is not my role as an MPC member to evaluate the decision to undertake fiscal
13

I am grateful to Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale for their elucidations of the strengths and weaknesses of these surveys for
forecasting.
14
UK exports have been growing strongly, but net exports have been negative until the last quarter, due to continued strength in
imports, and it is net exports that are an accounting component of output growth.

consolidation in the United Kingdom in this form at this pace – it is my role to make the best forecast I can for
the UK economy, taking the fiscal policies set by elected officials as given. We do know from cross-national
studies something about fiscal policy and its impact on consumption growth and inflation that gives me a
good basis for making such a forecast.

The record is that fiscal policy works when it is tried, though its impact varies with the structure and state of
the economy trying it.

15

A recently published authoritative study by the IMF (Leigh, et al, (2010)) confirms

broad patterns already known. The smaller and more open your economy, the more fiscal impulses leak
abroad, so the smaller the multiplier (that is, the impact on the private economy of changes in the
government deficit beyond the direct impact of government spending and taxes). The more indebted your
economy, the less effective fiscal stimulus will be, and the less costly consolidation will be. When fiscal
policy contracts, a key determinant of the contractionary impact on the economy as a whole is whether
monetary policy eases in response. The only examples of economies that have expansionary (for the
economy overall) fiscal contractions are those small economies with very high initial debt to GDP ratios that
drive down their government interest rates and attract large inflows of foreign investment relative to the size
of the economy through consolidation. Think of Ireland, for example.
For most economies, Leigh, et al (2010) show that household consumption, the lion‟s share of GDP, grows
more slowly and in fact usually contracts during a fiscal consolidation. Figure 2 shows what happened to
household consumption in 49 fiscal consolidation episodes identified in their sample of 15 advanced
economies from 1980 to the present. The darkened swathe shows the path of consumption for cases
th

th

between the 25 and 75 percentile of outcomes (meaning, we leave out the extreme cases). Consumption
declines from trend over the first year of consolidation by half a percent on average, and stays that amount
below trend through the succeeding three years before recovering.

Figure 3 repeats the exercise looking only at 27 fiscal consolidation episodes since 1990. I pull this out
because it should limit the assessment to cases more comparable to our present situation in the UK in terms
of average inflation rates, monetary regimes, debt levels, and globalization. The contractionary impact of
fiscal consolidation on household consumption is at least as great as in the wider sample – the range of
th

consumption declines (still only to the 75 percentile) extends to much greater magnitudes, which means
that the more contractionary cases make up a higher proportion of the more recent consolidations than in the
total post-1980 sample. On average, the pattern is largely the same as in Figure 2, with a sustained multiyear but not precipitous decline in household consumption growth versus trend. These charts make no
distinction between cases when monetary policy was eased in response to the consolidation, including cases
where it did, but Leigh, et al‟s (2010) more detailed assessment suggests that the upper end of the swathe
(less contractionary) is associated with monetary ease.
15

See Auerbach and Gale (2009), Fatas and Mihov (2009), Kuttner and Posen (2002), and Posen (1998), and the references therein.
Ilzetzki, et al (2010) give a somewhat opposing view, emphasizing the dependence of fiscal outcomes on exchange rate and monetary
regimes (the latter not inconsistent in Leigh, et al (2010), however).

How should the current fiscal contraction program in the UK fit in to the forecast, given these patterns and
the specifics of the UK situation? The consolidation program announced by the Coalition government is
more ambitious in size and speed than most of the fiscal consolidations seen in the last 30 years. The UK is
a larger economy than many of the economies that undertook previous consolidations. The UK starts out
with a lower debt/GDP ratio, far longer maturity debt, and a higher credit rating than most of the economies
that undertook fiscal consolidations. Perhaps most importantly, interest rates on long-term UK government
debt are already at historic lows in both nominal and real terms, so there is little room for an offset for interest
rates to fall further in response to the consolidation program.

16

I would add at this point that there is good long-term reason to believe that the rate of consumption growth in
the UK should decline temporarily, even absent fiscal consolidation. If one takes the standard determinants
of variation over time in national household savings rates – wealth, income growth, and uncertainty (usually
proxied by unemployment) – the UK savings rate should have gone up as a result of the crisis.

17

Moreover,

if the UK is to rebalance is accumulation of foreign debt through current account deficits, the country has to
save more (and increased government savings alone will not be enough to do it, given current public budget
deficits). In fact, one would expect the UK household savings rate to be a good 3pp or 4pp of disposable
income higher than it is right now, since it has returned to the low rate seen in the height of the boom of
2004-07. Perhaps one can attribute the support of consumption to the impact of the Bank‟s easy monetary
policy, and that certainly has played a role as intended .

18

But the Federal Reserve has also engaged in

massively stimulative monetary policy, and the US household savings rate has risen by 4pp of disposable
income since the crisis began. Household indebtedness is at similar levels in the two countries, so that is not
the explanation. In fact, as shown in Figure 4, of the advanced economies worst hit by the crisis, the UK has
had the smallest increase in household savings since the crisis began.

19

Thus, absent additional monetary ease of the sort I advocated in Posen (2010c) to offset the impact of fiscal
consolidation, we should forecast a substantial drag on household consumption growth over the next three
years, beyond the direct impact of government austerity. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, where we match up
the Leigh, et al (2010) consolidation cases with inflation outcomes, fiscal consolidations are also usually
associated with declines in inflation, on average by 1% over two years – even when cases where monetary
accommodation accompanied fiscal consolidation are left in the sample. In Table 1 we pull out the cases
th

where inflation initially was above the colored swathe (i.e., inflation above the 75 percentile in the sample)
since 1990. Even in all seven cases with inflation relatively high at the start of the consolidation, inflation
16

The UK government‟s commitment to fiscal consolidation may well have pre-empted interest rate increases of the sort seen in the
euro area, and that is a legitimate motivation for undertaking such a program. As a matter of forecasting, however, pre-empting a bad
outcome does not show up as a boost to growth in the short-term. It is like those NHS ads telling you how much money you‟ll save and
how much healthier you‟ll be if you quit smoking – if you pre-empt problems by never smoking, you‟re better off, but you don‟t get the
bonus from quitting.
17
The economists Christopher Carroll and John Muellbauer developed these workhorse models of forecasting household savings
behavior, and the theory underlying them.

20

Another reason for taking the coming fiscal consolidation into

account when making the forecast for UK inflation.
Empirical Regularity 4: Unit Labour Costs Are a Significant Predictor of Inflation –

This point should seem self-evident, especially to anyone with knowledge of the British economy in the
1960s and 1970s, so I will be brief. A huge determinant of inflationary pressures is the development of
wages. What matters is not wage growth in nominal terms per se, however, but wage growth versus
productivity.

21

In other words, what are the costs to businesses and consumers in terms of labor for the

products you get – if worker productivity rises, so more goods are produced with the same labor inputs,
wages can rise commensurate with that productivity increase without causing inflationary pressures. It is
when wage costs rise faster than productivity that inflation rises. Economists therefore track what are called
unit labour costs, meant to capture this labor input per widget produced across the whole economy, as well
as wage developments themselves. For the UK, there is a strong statistical relationship between annual
growth in unit labour costs and CPI inflation a year later (see Figure 7). This relationship has held up
through the last two decades, including during the most recent years.

In fact, as shown in Figure 8, movements in unit labour costs and CPI a year later track rather closely in
direction, even if not always in magnitude. Right now, unit labour costs in the UK have declined markedly
with the revival of labour productivity in British businesses. This suggests that wage growth in the coming
year will be coming down from its already low level. This ignores the likely freeze or contraction of wages
throughout the public sector to come, and whatever spillover effect that and public sector layoffs may have
on private sector wages as well.

Just to be consistent, let me place this result in a cross-national context, although no one to my knowledge
challenges the fundamental basis for a relationship between wage growth and inflation. Figure 9 plots the
average annual nominal wage growth for various multi-year periods for a set of 15 advanced economies
starting in 1996. This is not shown in terms of unit labour costs, because comparable ULC data is not
entirely reliable, but since in the advanced economies productivity growth rates tend to be pretty stable in
recent decades, the distortion is not that great from using nominal wage growth instead.

22

Again, the

relationship is quite robust across countries over time, even in the low inflation period with monetary regimes
and globalization most comparable to our own situation today.

20

We include Portugal in 2000 which did not start out with above 75th percentile inflation, and it is the exception.
Posen and Popov Gould (2007) discuss some of the literature on this point.
22
2009 observations are broken out separately because that was when the crisis hit labor markets leading to way off trend productivity
behavior.

The UK Inflation Forecast If This Time Isn’t Different –

I believe the best forecast for the UK economy and for inflation over the medium-term is made on the basis
of well established empirical regularities from similar situations to the one we now are in, following a financial
crisis. I believe that over-interpreting recent runs of data, whether they are of good news (like UK exports or
growth abroad) or of bad (the above target CPI inflation outcomes for many months) will lead to bad
forecasts, and bad forecasts lead to bad monetary policy. We have to take the right lessons from our past
forecast errors, and not over react to them in a defensive manner to confirm our counter-inflationary bona
fides. Otherwise, the Monetary Policy Committee does the British people a disservice.

Most importantly, we should recognize that things are not fundamentally different in the UK economy at this
point from what has happened in other post crisis advanced economies. That means:

Output and employment still have a meaningful effect on inflation;
The UK economy still has a large output gap to close, pushing down on inflation;
UK household consumption will likely decline in response to fiscal consolidation;
UK inflation will likely decline in response to fiscal consolidation; and,
UK unit labour costs are declining, pushing down on inflation.

All of these taken together lead me to a forecast for UK inflation well below that of the November Inflation
Report, and more importantly a forecast that at the target horizon of two-plus years, annual CPI inflation will
be significantly below target (perhaps by 1pp or more). Shocks from the eurozone or from commodity prices
– or factors I have not thought of – could overwhelm this forecast between now and then, but if there was
good reason to believe those shocks were all to one side for inflation, or were likely to eventuate, I would put
them into my central forecast. I do not think that is necessary, and in the absence of such shocks, the list of
fundamentals I just gave should determine UK inflatioin.

One could insist that the recent outturns of data give a different picture, but to my mind that requires
assuming this time in the UK is different, and therefore denying a majority if not all of the empirical
regularities that I have set out today. That strikes me as a misguided way to make a forecast, especially in
the absence of a convincing story to explain the anomalous behavior implied by such a forecast. Yes, it is
possible that UK supply capacity disappeared despite relatively low increases in unemployment and
liquidations, that a large and ambitious fiscal consolidation undertaken at a time of already low interest rates
will not be a drag on consumption, that declining unit labor costs do not presage a meaningful decline in
inflation, and so on. It is also possible that our recent snows mean that global warming is not happening,
and recent performance in matches mean that Newcastle will win the Premiership. Possible, but I would not
bet on it, and I certainly would not make policy on the basis of such a forecast.
