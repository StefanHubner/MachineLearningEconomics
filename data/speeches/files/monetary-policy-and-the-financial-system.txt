INSTITUTIONAL MONEY MARKET FUNDS ASSOCIATION, 2 APRIL 2008

Alongside many others, the money market fund industry has for months now been grappling with
turmoil and fragility across financial markets. It continues to pose serious challenges for all of
us, and so I shall use this evening to summarise briefly a few of the strands in my own thinking
about monetary policy and the financial system.

Monetary policy

First, monetary policy. The tightening of credit conditions domestically and internationally
makes it likely that aggregate demand will slow, with a risk that it will slow considerably. There
is, in consequence, a meaningful downwards threat to inflation over the medium term. Usually,
the MPC would respond by cutting Bank Rate sufficiently to offset more or less entirely what we
judged, over time, to be the impact of the tighter financial conditions on the path of spending, so
as to ensure that aggregate demand remained broadly in line with the economy’s productive
capacity. But conditions do not favour such a “business as usual” approach to demand
management. That is because, alongside those downside risks to inflation, there are also upside
risks to inflation over the medium term – and I am stressing “medium term” – stemming from the
rise in commodity prices and the decline in sterling’s exchange rate. In the near term, CPI
inflation is very likely to rise to materially above our 2% target. The question is whether that
unavoidable temporary rise will remain just that, temporary; or whether it will feed into
medium-term expectations of inflation, and so get reflected in wages and prices going forward
and, thus, in domestically-generated inflation.

Given this unusual combination of significant downside and upside risks to the medium-term
inflation outlook, the broad policy strategy is to offset some but not all of the adverse shock to
demand from tighter credit conditions. And to do so by changing Bank Rate gradually and with
transparency about that broad strategy. To be clear, this approach probably means allowing a
degree of slack to develop in the economy, in the interests of avoiding taking risks with inflation
on the upside. Only by underpinning the credibility of the nominal anchor provided by the
MPC’s commitment to the inflation target will we maintain scope to cushion the real economy
from the effects of the stresses in the international financial system. If we implement this
strategy successfully, we will be able to provide more durable support for demand and activity.

If, by contrast, we were to adopt a course that let the inflation genie out of the bottle, we would
find ourselves needing to tighten policy, exacerbating the slowdown in activity.

That broad strategy is not a recipe for inaction. The central projection in February’s Inflation
Report was for inflation to return to close to the 2% target over the coming two to three years,
conditional on the market’s expectation of further cuts in Bank Rate. But nor does the strategy
determine a definite path for Bank Rate over the coming months. Each of us on the MPC must
form a judgment month by month on which of the risks to the inflation outlook – from financial
conditions or from rising costs – is proving more potent, and so a judgment on the degree to
which we can set a course that underpins demand.

Since the February Inflation Report, oil prices are around 10% higher, and sterling’s exchange
rate around 4% lower, so the immediate cost pressures are worse. The good news is that, in the
labour market, nominal earnings growth has so far remained subdued, notwithstanding the rise in
near-term inflation expectations revealed by a range of surveys. This is perhaps suggestive of
the adjustment in real take-home pay made necessary by the sharp increase in firms’ costs due to
the further rises in commodity prices. In manufacturing, firms’ input costs have risen sharply
over the past twelve months; and output price inflation has reached nearly 6%. A big question is
to what extent competition amongst retailers will dampen the pass through into retail prices.
Anecdotally, retailers still sound as though they are competing fiercely on prices, and driving
down other costs in order to maintain their margins.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the ledger, many essentially backward-looking indicators of UK
real demand and activity have held up reasonably well. But we should not yet place great weight
on that. It can sometimes take time for disturbances to affect real economic activity. In the
United States, arguably there was quite a lag between the onset of problems in housing finance
and the pass through to spending. The UK looks to be quite a lot better than the US. The latest
data for Q4 last year did, however, suggest that household spending on durables slowed quite
significantly. And we are seeing softening in consumer confidence and property market
conditions. So the picture on the real economy is mixed.

What is clear is that credit conditions are unambiguously tighter than two months ago,
underlining that source of downside risk to the outlook for demand and inflation. In retail
lending markets, banks have raised the interest rates charged (relative to Bank Rate) on new
MKTS_DOCS:248304v1

lending, but they have all been doing much the same and many borrowers seem to have been
willing to pay the extra. In consequence, banks generally may not have achieved their desired
conservation of balance sheet capacity, and we are now seeing the withdrawal of some lending
products.

And in wholesale markets, the spread between the price that the banks themselves pay for funds,
roughly LIBOR, and the expected central bank policy rate has, again, widened significantly over
the past couple of months across the major international markets. Many financial contracts are
linked closely to three-month LIBOR so, other things being equal, the increase in money market
spreads has the effect of reducing the level of Bank Rate consistent with unchanged monetary
conditions.

At the Committee’s March meeting, I judged that an immediate further cut, following
February’s, might very easily have been misunderstood as a change of strategy away from the
one focused on the medium-term outlook for inflation that I have spelled out this evening. My
own vote at the April meeting will depend on all the data, some of it still to reach us, since then.

Financial system deleveraging: legacy portfolios

Whatever path monetary policy takes in the UK in the months ahead, it is clear that the process
of deleveraging in the financial system is not complete. Some asset prices embody a hefty
discount for the current illiquidity in markets, which feeds into the accounting measure of
financial firms’ capitalisation, and so into perceptions of counterparty credit risk and money
market conditions. In consequence, there remains a risk that credit creation – the lubricant that
the financial system provides to the real economy – will be further impaired. Several features of
our financial system lie behind this, and I want to touch on just a few of them.

Financial markets have swung from a prolonged period of underpricing risk to now plausibly
overpricing risk on at least some products. And yet, one might think perversely, we have also
swung from an over abundant supply of credit to a much more restrictive supply of new credit.
The global insurance industry provides an interesting contrast with banking in this respect. For
sure, it too is capable of systematically misjudging risks. But when a shift in risk appreciation
and pricing occurs, the reinsurance industry often separates the run off of old portfolios
containing mispriced contracts from the establishment of new vehicles, capitalised separately to
MKTS_DOCS:248304v1

5
take advantage of attractive terms on new business. And for regular insurance, many contracts
are annual, so adversely priced business can run off fairly quickly. Banking typically works
quite differently. Banks around the world are carrying portfolios of term loans that are the
legacy of the boom years. There is uncertainty – amongst banks’ management, shareholders and
funders – about the degree of fundamental impairment in those portfolios. New loans are booked
to the same balance sheets. And so many banks face a choice between, on the one hand,
conserving capital and liquidity to support legacy portfolios; and, on the other hand, deploying
capital and liquidity to write new business on what some see as the attractive terms and
conditions now available. The banking system simply is not structured routinely to insulate new
business from the legacy of past mistakes; funding and capital are fungible.

This predicament may be exacerbated by other features of the current environment.

One is an apparent reluctance on the part of banks to raise fresh capital except where the market
thinks that it is beyond doubt that they need to do so. Given the feedback from credit conditions
to asset prices and the real economy and so potentially to banks’ future earnings, it might seem
slightly odd for banks internationally to be maintaining distributions to shareholders but
tightening credit availability in order to preserve resources. This has to be seen in the wider
context.

One possible explanation for banks holding back from raising fresh capital is that they may want
to avoid giving an adverse signal about themselves. If there is a co-ordination problem, the
regulatory authorities internationally should be able to tackle it, allied to ensuring prudent
valuations of legacy portfolios. But another possible explanation is that, like some other market
participants, bankers may believe that many legacy assets are fundamentally undervalued at
present and that the markets for securitised assets will, with time, recover and reopen. On that
view, banks are avoiding becoming overcapitalised on a fundamentals (or forward looking)
basis, and so setting off another expansionary phase in the credit cycle, a little further down the
road. The serious puzzle which that underlines is why there is a dearth of buyers for the
supposedly undervalued paper. With the terms and availability of financing from banks and
dealers having tightened, levered funds are hardly likely to be the US Cavalry. But it is
interesting that there has not been more interest from investment institutions with ostensibly long
holding periods, which are largely unlevered and are not exposed to liquidity risk from
borrowing short and lending long. What we commonly hear from contacts is that investment
MKTS_DOCS:248304v1

6
managers do not want to be caught out if asset prices fall further before they recover. But no one
can seriously believe that they can spot the bottom of the market, and short-term horizons should
not weigh heavily in longer-term investment institutions. All of which suggests that there may
be structural impediments. Those could include some combination of the reasonable difficulty
that some asset managers experience in assessing the quality of securitised assets; and mandates
and accounting policies that may have the effect of shortening asset managers’ time horizons.

The challenge for your own industry seems to have been slightly different. The managers of
some money funds around the world, although I am sure not all of your members, joined in the
‘search for yield’ by going down the credit spectrum and increasing maturity mismatch during
the boom in credit markets. As those funds have moved back towards home base, shortening the
maturity and increasing the liquidity of their assets, one effect has been a reduction in the net
supply of term funding into the international banking system.

That has been one of many contributors to the liquidity strains evident in money markets. But
those strains have also been exacerbated by an unexpected breakdown in the technology for
liquidity insurance provided by central banks.

For well over a century, throughout the industrialised world there has in effect been something
akin to a Social Contract between the banking system and the authorities. The banking system is
permitted to profit from undertaking leveraged maturity transformation in the course of
intermediating the liquid savings of depositors into illiquid loans to households, firms and others.
In doing so, commercial banks provide liquidity insurance, whether via demand deposits or
committed lines of credit. They can do this because their deposit liabilities are money, which
puts them at the heart of the payments system and is what makes them special; banks are at the
heart of a monetary economy. In return, the authorities respond with a combination of prudential
supervision, to contain the risks that banks run; deposit insurance, to protect savers; and liquidity
insurance from the central bank. Smaller commercial banks can try to buy liquidity insurance
from their larger brethren. Large banks cannot realistically do the same. They need to hold
liquid assets. But there is no cast iron guarantee that asset markets will remain liquid in all
conditions. So since Bagehot’s day, central banks have stood ready to provide unlimited
liquidity against good collateral at a rate that is higher than the normal market rate. However,
during the period of turmoil since last summer it has proved toxic, here and overseas, for banks
to access liquidity on those terms from central banks unless in broad and quality company. That
MKTS_DOCS:248304v1

7
has created uncertainty about the access of banks to the central banks in practice, and has
required innovation and clear assurances from the central banking community. This alone will
require reforms to the way in which central banks use their balance sheets, and money creating
power, to sustain financial stability.

Banks will also need to adapt. It seems that at not a few firms, the discipline of risk management
somehow got separated from that of balance sheet management (or funding). It was effectively
assumed that financing markets would remain open come what may. There is a question of
whether treasury management should somehow be insulated from the pressures of a profit centre.
Separately, assumptions were made about relationships between asset prices that have proved
groundless. One such is the spread between term money market rates and expected central bank
policy rates. So long as the so-called LIBOR/Overnight Index Swap spread was narrow at all
maturities, few market participants cared about whether they hedged against a LIBOR-based
instrument when in fact sometimes they really needed a hedge relative to a risk-free rate. We
sense that some international fixed-income asset managers would like there to be OIS-based
contracts alongside LIBOR-based financial contracts, so that they can tailor their hedges more
precisely. There should be wider benefits from contracts based purely on the risk-free rate rather
than embodying liquidity premia and credit-risk premia of various kinds. That is something for
the industry.

But better liquidity-insurance technology and better risk management will not abolish the credit
cycle. Looking further ahead, the big question will be whether the authorities can tame the
credit cycle without sacrificing the incentives to enterprise that are so important in a dynamic
economy. The debate about the micro regulation of banks will need to take account of whether
or not we can deliver that macroprudential objective. For too long, the debate has got
sidetracked. Into whether we can rely on monetary policy “mopping up” after bubbles burst. Or
into whether monetary policy could be used to control asset prices as well as doing its orthodox
job of steering nominal trends in the economy, which I should say can include taking account of
prospective risks of inflation volatility over the medium term. Ideas circulating already include
minimum margin requirements or capital ratios that vary not only across instruments or firms but
also through time as credit conditions change. We need calmly to explore whether there are also
other possibilities. But let me make this absolutely clear: there are formidable obstacles to
finding a solution. In the monetary sphere, a regime of floating exchange rates allows individual
countries to pursue their own domestic monetary objectives. But in a world in which capital
MKTS_DOCS:248304v1

8
flows freely, local attempts to control the pace of credit creation, particularly within the financial
system, may not work. All of that will need to be thought through. But first we need to
concentrate on the immediate challenges.

Summary

In a speech four months ago, I stressed that “we must try to avoid a vicious circle in which
tighter liquidity conditions, lower asset values, impaired capital resources, reduced credit supply,
and slower aggregate demand feed back on each other”. I identified monetary policy, liquidity
policy, and regulatory capital policy as being amongst the instruments the authorities would need
to use. That remains the case, as the stress in the global financial system has continued and, in
the US at least, evidence of a feedback loop is apparent. Each of those instruments is constrained
in some degree. That underlines the need for close co-operation between the authorities and the
industry, and internationally.
