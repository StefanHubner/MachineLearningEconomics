Introductory Remarks

Financial markets play an important role in our economy. They help determine the borrowing costs for
households, companies and governments, facilitate cross-border trade and investment and enable
corporates and other participants to manage and transfer financial risks. As corporate treasurers, I’m sure
the effective functioning of the markets you operate in is important to you.

Financial markets are important to central banks too. Their effective functioning can help support broader
economic growth, and promote financial stability. And they also play an important role in enabling the
Bank of England to conduct operations and implement policies that help promote monetary and financial
stability. It is therefore in the Bank’s interest to support the development of effective market infrastructures
and encourage good behaviours.

The Governor noted in his Mansion House speech in 2015 that markets are a powerful means for prosperity
and security for all, and as such they need to retain the consent of society – what he termed a ‘social licence’
– to be allowed to operate, innovate and grow. Unfortunately, the scale of misconduct that has emerged
since the financial crisis has both damaged public trust and impaired the effectiveness of important markets.
We need to rebuild that trust, and markets need to regain their social licence.

In order to do that we need to ensure that there are appropriate infrastructures in place supporting financial
markets. By infrastructures I don’t just mean physical infrastructures such as trading venues and settlement
systems. I also mean ‘social’ infrastructures such as standards of market practice and codes of conduct.
And once embedded, these infrastructures need to be constantly monitored, and evolve to keep pace with
underlying markets and social expectations.
That’s not something the authorities can do on their own. It is going to require all market actors, both public
and private, to recognise their responsibilities to the system as a whole and work together to redefine the
‘rules of the game’. There should be benefits for all involved, both in terms of understanding what is
expected of you as a market participant, but also what you should expect of others in the market, which can
be a powerful tool in itself. So everyone should have an incentive to play their part.
Today I’m going to take you through a couple of examples of initiatives that the Bank is involved in which are
looking to promote more effective markets, and how these are likely to be relevant to you. But before I get to
those examples I want to take a couple of minutes to provide a bit of background on the broader work that
the Bank and other UK authorities have done in this area.

The Fair and Effective Markets Review – 3 years on

This June marks three years on from the launch of the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR). This was
a comprehensive, point-in-time stock take of market functioning and effectiveness across Fixed Income,
Currency, and Commodity (FICC) markets. It involved a wide-ranging consultation phase where the Bank
heard from a wide range of market participants including corporate treasurers, asset managers,
infrastructure providers and banks – with over 800 meetings and nearly 1000 pages of written submissions.

FEMR made a number of recommendations aimed at raising standards and restoring trust in FICC markets.
The authorities have subsequently worked with market participants to make important strides in taking
forward these recommendations and achieving the overall goals of this initiative.

The FEMR implementation report noted that, in some cases, the main impediment to necessary changes in
market infrastructure may be the absence of a ready means for users to co-ordinate on a preferred way
forward. So FEMR recommended the creation of the new FICC Markets Standards Board (FMSB), with
participation from a broad cross-section of firms and end-users involving regular dialogue with the
authorities. This Board has been up and running since 2015 and is aiming to improve conduct,
professionalism and accountability of individuals through producing standards and guidelines, practical case
studies and other materials on market practice. The FMSB has been involved in the production of the Codes
we are here to discuss today.

More broadly, FEMR also recommended that public authorities should stand ready to help catalyse
market-led reform held back by private sector co-ordination failures. In some cases that might involve a
direct public role in infrastructure development. In others, the Bank is able to use its convening powers to
bring market participants together to achieve market-led reforms.

Interest rate benchmark reforms

The first example I want to discuss has used both of these tools. Following cases of attempted manipulation
of global reference rates, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2014 recommended the development of near
risk-free interest rate benchmarks that could be used as alternatives to Libor, alongside the reform of the
existing benchmarks such as Libor. The aim was to ensure the availability of a set of robust benchmarks
that would allow market participants to appropriately manage their risk.

In the UK, the key sterling unsecured benchmark was the Sterling Overnight Interest Average (SONIA). But
the underlying market on which SONIA was based was declining in size and, in order to ensure its future
robustness, it needed to be reformed. Given the importance of SONIA to the wider market – the notional

value of outstanding derivative contracts that referenced SONIA exceeded £7 trillion in October 2016 – and
the challenges in collecting the necessary data to reform the benchmark, the Bank took the decision to take
over the administration of SONIA. We are now in the process of reforming it to be based on a new collection
of money market transactions data, covering a much wider range of transactions than the existing SONIA
benchmark.

The Bank also convened a private sector working group to decide on the appropriate sterling near risk-free
rate. That group considered a range of potential rates, including both secured and unsecured benchmarks.
It recently recommended the Sterling Overnight Interest Average (SONIA) as the preferred alternative to
sterling Libor. This expression of market support for SONIA as the sterling near risk-free rate is a major
milestone in the benchmark reform process.
The group’s work now moves on to its next phase which considers how best to promote the use of SONIA in
sterling markets, through active outreach to market participants. As regular users of Libor, corporate
treasuries will be affected by these plans and have a potentially key role to play in supporting the adoption of
a reformed SONIA benchmark, which is expected to take place over the coming years. For that reason I
encourage the ACT and its corporate members to engage with the Bank and the Working Group over the
coming months.

Codes of Conduct

A further example of how the Bank has been working with market participants in the UK and globally to
catalyse much needed market-led reforms is the development of new codes of conduct covering the
Global FX and UK Money Markets.

Codes of good or best practice are ultimately another mechanism to embed good behaviours amongst
market participants in the absence of, or in complement to, market regulation. They can be thought of as
one form of licence to manoeuvre through constantly evolving financial markets, including defining the red,
amber and green signals that market participants must be aware of when operating in them.

Codes of practice for these markets are nothing new. Market conduct in a number of typically lightly
regulated over-the-counter markets was previously covered by guidance set out in voluntary market codes of
good practice. The Bank of England has historically played a role in co-ordinating the production of several
of these. The most prominent was the Non-Investment Products (NIPs) Code, which applied to sterling and
foreign currency wholesale deposits, spot and forward FX, and bullion. There was also a Securities
Borrowing and Lending Code and a Gilt Repo Code, which were owned by the Bank-chaired Securities
Lending and Repo Committee. All these codes had become out-dated and obsolete – FEMR noted that all
of the FICC market enforcement actions brought against firms in the UK contravened the provisions of the
NIPs code in relevant markets. So the case for reform was clear.

Three new codes of conduct have now replaced these former codes: the UK Money Markets Code and the
3

FX Global Code, which are the focus today’s session, as well as the Global Precious Metals Code . These
codes were launched in April and May this year. They establish reformed guidance on conduct and market
practice for participants active in these markets, and provide mechanisms to encourage and increase
adherence to these standards.

The markets these codes cover are big and important. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged
$5.1 trillion per day globally in April 2016. In the sterling deposit and repo overnight markets last year, the
average daily number of transactions was 3,000, with a total value of over £160bn. This underlines the need
for participants to understand and adhere to high standards of market conduct. And every participant who
uses these markets, regardless of the scale and extent of their operations, has an individual responsibility to
play a part.

The development of the Codes has very much been a partnership between public and private sectors. The
Codes apply to all market users – covering buy-side, sell-side, bank and non-bank participants, as well as
trading platforms and other market infrastructure – and the engagement has necessarily been as diverse.
We’ve been very grateful for the engagement of the ACT, representing your views as important participants
in these markets, as the Codes have been developed. I hope the process by which both Codes were
developed will provide market participants with confidence that the Codes accurately reflect good, and
achievable, market practice.

All the codes are aligned along the same fundamental principles. These are intended to promote robust, fair,
liquid, open and appropriately transparent markets supported by effective infrastructures. The principles
specifically cover: Ethics, Governance, Compliance and Risk Management, Information Sharing, Execution
and Settlement practices in the respective markets.

So we have good quality codes, but clearly that alone is insufficient: The Codes will only rebuild trust if they
are actively used and widely adopted by market participants and drive a market-wide shift in culture and
attitudes – one that embeds behavioural norms that are consistent with both the letter and spirit of the
Codes. That is where you come in. These codes are voluntary, but we very much hope you will all feel able
to sign up to the principles contained in the codes.

There are good reasons why you, as corporate treasurers, should want to sign up to the code. The first is
that obligations in these markets don’t just fall on the sell-side. There are responsibilities that directly apply
to the buy-side too. The Codes set out what those responsibilities are and what the expectations are for you
to manage them. To take a couple of examples, the Global FX Code talks about handling transactions that
could have a sizable impact on the market, such as those associated with merger and acquisition activity.

It also sets out expectations around confirming block trades, with a worked example of non-compliant
behaviour by a corporate. Understanding your responsibilities in these markets will help you manage your
business in a way that is consistent with established good practice.

The second reason for signing up is that the Codes define how corporates should expect to be treated by
their banks and other market participants. Again, to take an example, banks have an obligation to set
mark-ups for clients in a fair and reasonable manner, and the Code promotes transparency around this
process. So the Code should help ensure you are treated fairly, if your bank has signed up. But importantly,
it should also help you to be an informed market participant by providing a framework for you to engage with
your bank, and setting out the information you should expect to receive. So you should view the Codes as
tools that support your access to these key markets on a fair and consistent basis.
What does “signing up” to the codes mean in practice? There are two points I’d like to make here. The first
is on the concept of adherence, and specifically what steps market participants should take. The FX Global
4

Code has an accompanying report on adherence , but in my view it applies equally to both Codes. As set
out in that report, there are three key steps towards adherence that market participants are encouraged to
take: (i) embed the Codes’ principles in your day-to-day practices, (ii) monitor, through time, how effectively
you have done so, and (iii) demonstrate your own adherence to the Codes, to counterparties and others. To
facilitate public demonstration of adherence, a tailored Statement of Commitment has been developed for
each Code. This should provide market participants with an accessible and standardised means of
demonstrating Code adherence, without the need to provide bespoke sign offs for difference counterparties
and service providers. Widespread use of the Statement of Commitment can also help to raise awareness
about, and increase the profile of the Codes. I encourage all market participants, including all of you in this
room, to use the Statement of Commitment, as we at the Bank will be doing.

The second point I want to make is on the concept of proportionality. When writing the codes we were very
conscious that they were going to apply to a diverse group of market participants, and there was unlikely to
be a “one size fits all” solution. The appropriate steps for a large sell-side participant to take to align its
activities with a given principle will necessarily differ from the appropriate steps to be taken by a small
corporate. So the concept of proportionality has been strongly embedded in both Codes. This should make
it possible for all market users to align their activities to the Codes in a way that is appropriate for their
business.

Concluding Remarks

It has been very encouraging to see the work and engagement between public authorities and market
participants to promote fair and effective markets over the last few years. The work on benchmark reform

and the development of Codes of Practice are just two concrete examples of the work that has been done to
rebuild the social licence that markets need to operate effectively. But this is by no means the end of the
story. The evolution of markets requires continuous and forward looking engagement, so that market
infrastructures are kept up to speed with market innovations. That will remain an ongoing challenge, and
one that will require all market participants to work together and do their bit for the good of the overall
financial system.
