Global imbalances:
the perspective of the Bank of England
MERVYN KING
Governor
Bank of England

In 2009, demand in the world’s major economies fell, relative to its pre-crisis trend, by around USD 2.5 trillion
or 5 per cent of GDP. The financial crisis damaged virtually every country. Global imbalances helped
to fuel the financial crisis. And today they threaten the sustainability of the recovery in global demand.
Global imbalances are a reflection of today’s decentralised international monetary and financial system.
All the main players around the world are rationally pursuing their own self interest. But the financial
crisis has revealed that what makes sense for each player individually does not always make sense
in aggregate. These actions had collective consequences. The main lesson from the crisis is the need
to find better ways of ensuring the right collective outcome. Improved financial regulation will help to
intermediate the flows associated with global imbalances. But the global economy will remain vulnerable
to the risks associated with imbalances if they are not tackled at source. Two principles should underpin
the way ahead. First, discussions should focus on the underlying disagreement about the right speed of
adjustment to the real pattern of spending and hence the reduction in these imbalances. This discussion
should be informed by countries’ ability to follow that path in a sustainable way. Second, many policies,
in addition to changes in exchange rates, will be needed to reduce imbalances. If agreement is not
reached on these two principles, at best there will be a weak world recovery; at worst, the seeds of the
next financial crisis will be sown.

n 2009, demand in the world’s major economies
fell, relative to its pre-crisis trend, by around
USD 2.5 trillion or 5 per cent of GDP. The financial
crisis left almost no country unscathed. While
unprecedented policy measures allowed the world to
escape a second Great Depression, the global recovery
so far has been uneven and it remains fragile.

This article looks at the role global imbalances played
in fuelling the financial crisis, and the importance of
achieving a rebalancing of global demand in order to
foster a sustainable recovery. Its key message is that,
in today’s highly interconnected global economy, a
top priority for national policymakers must be to find
ways to rebalance global demand. That is important to
ensure both (i) the level of world demand is sufficient
for the world recovery to continue and (ii) that future
crises are avoided.

IMBALANCES CONTRIBUTED
TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the
early 1970s, international monetary arrangements have
evolved into a decentralised system. Countries are free
to make independent choices about their monetary,
exchange rate and financial stability policies. Greater

capital mobility has also been one of the defining
features of the current regime. In the run-up to the
recent crisis, net capital flows more than doubled in
less than a decade (Chart 1) and global imbalances
widened to near unprecedented levels (Chart 2).
Increased capital flows can raise global output to
the extent that they seek out the most productive
investment opportunities, transferring savings from
countries where the marginal product of capital
is low to countries where the marginal product
of capital is high. But in today’s system, some
advanced economies such as the United States and
the United Kingdom have been running large and
persistent current account deficits, while emerging
market economies, in particular in Asia and among
oil exporters, have been running current account
surpluses. This ‘uphill’ flow of capital from the
dynamic, labour-abundant emerging economies to
the mature advanced economies is, at least in some
instances, puzzling. So factors other than differences
in the marginal product of capital must have been at
work (Lucas, 1990). It is notable that the purchasers
of foreign assets have been emerging market public
sectors rather than private sectors. As a result, there
has been a more than ten-fold increase in reserve
holdings over the past 15 years. The governments in
those economies have been playing an intermediary
role, channelling domestic saving away from the
local economy and into international capital markets.
And emerging market economies’ asset of choice
has been safe, typically sovereign financial assets.

These growing flow imbalances have been
accompanied by growing stock imbalances. The US
net external liability position quadrupled in size
in the course of a decade, rising to USD 3.5 trillion
in 2008 (25 per cent of GDP). And the net external
asset positions of Japan and Germany rose by around
USD 1.7 trillion and USD 0.8 trillion respectively
(around 35 per cent and 25 per cent of 2008 GDP) over
the same period, while Chinese net external assets
reached USD 1.5 trillion, a third of GDP, in 2008.
What drove these net capital flows ‘uphill’? Chart 1
illustrates that these flows were associated with a
decline in long-term interest rates, pointing to either
a fall in desired investment or an increase in desired
saving at the global level. Were such changes to occur
in any given country, they would tend to increase
that country’s current account balance, leading
either to a smaller deficit or a larger surplus. But the
fact that global current account imbalances were
growing over this period indicates that these shifts
in saving-investment balances occurred in countries
that were already running surpluses.
Chart 3 demonstrates that rising saving-investment
imbalances in surplus countries were driven
primarily by increased saving, rather than decreased

investment. Although investment had been high and
rising in surplus countries, saving had been even
higher, and increasing at a faster rate. A ‘savings glut’
in surplus countries created ever-larger net capital
outflows that allowed the United States – and other
deficit countries – to finance continued borrowing.
In an accounting sense, the increase in emerging
market saving as a share of world GDP reflected
two factors. Taking China as an illustration, Chart 4
shows that in China, national savings increased as
percentage of national disposable income from 2001
onwards. Chart 5 shows that Chinese GDP has doubled

as a share of world GDP since 2001 – accentuating the
increase in Chinese savings as a share of world GDP.
There are three possible, inter-connected, reasons why
domestic saving in emerging economies increased.
First, many of these economies adopted a strategy of
expanding manufactured exports to create employment.
This required maintaining highly competitive exchange
rates and resulted in a substantial accumulation of
foreign exchange reserves. Second, in the aftermath of
the Asian crisis governments decided to accumulate
reserves for precautionary reasons. And third, low
levels of financial development may have played an
important role through a variety of channels including
(i) households choosing to self insure because of
incomplete access to domestic insurance markets
(Mendoza et al., 2007); (ii) an insufficient supply of
‘safe’ financial assets at home which encouraged
emerging market investors to accumulate ‘safe’
assets from advanced economies’ financial markets
(Caballero et al., 2008); (iii) the scaling back of
government-provided social safety nets and provision
of health and education services, which encouraged
households to build up saving buffers (Chamon
and Prasad, 2010); and (iv) inadequate provision of
financial services, which forced companies to retain
earnings to finance future investment.
Meanwhile, policymakers in advanced economies
followed a strategy of aiming to maintain an adequate
level of overall demand consistent with steady, low
inflation. In some cases, that implied that they ran
substantial current account deficits. At the time, all
the economies seemed to gain: just as the high-saving
countries created employment, the low-saving
economies enjoyed faster real consumption growth
as the price of imported manufactured goods fell.
Within their own terms, all these actions were
rational. All the main players – countries, regulators,
central banks, and commercial banks – were
rationally pursuing their own self interest. But what
made sense for each player individually did not make
sense in aggregate. These actions had collective
consequences.
In particular, the ‘glut’ of savings helped push down
on government bond yields – Warnock and Warnock
(2009), for example, estimate that if there had been
no foreign official purchases of US government bonds

in the year to May 2005, the 10-year Treasury yield
would have been around 80 basis points higher.
In an attempt to maintain returns at previous higher
levels, other investors ‘searched for yield’, which
encouraged risk taking, much of it under the guise
of ‘financial innovation’, resulting in an underpricing
of risk. This was evident in reduced discrimination
between assets of differing credit quality and the
development of increasingly complex financial
instruments employing leverage to generate higher
returns. Such risk taking was possible because of
inadequacies in financial regulation and supervision.
The pattern of growth, with the associated imbalances
and mis-pricing of risk, was not sustainable: as we
know only too well, the ensuing financial crisis
threatened the entire stability of the financial system.
Indeed, as Chart 6 illustrates, financial crises have
been a hallmark of the current incarnation of the
international monetary and financial system (IMFS),
with the reappearance of global financial instability
coinciding with the rapid increase in capital
mobility. Chart 7 shows that the change in countries’
non-performing loan (NPL) ratios between 2007
and 2009 and their current account balance in 2007 are
correlated, though of course the direction of causation
could go both ways. By comparison, the relationship
between the change in countries’ NPL ratios and
their banks’ capital ratios is insignificant. Table 1 also

shows that relative to Bretton Woods, today’s IMFS has
proven durable, but it has also coexisted, on average,
with: slower, more volatile, global growth; more
frequent downturns; higher inflation and inflation
volatility; larger current account imbalances; and
more frequent banking crises, currency crises
and external defaults. However, to some extent
these period-average metrics obscure significant
improvements over the current period, with the ‘great
moderation’ period post-1990 associated with much
better outcomes than those achieved in the 1970s and
1980s. Nevertheless, with the important exception of
inflation, the outcomes achieved during the Bretton
Woods period were better than those attained since
1990. While this does not imply causation of course,
it does suggest that better outcomes may be possible.

if they are not tackled at source. That will require
some way of ensuring that countries’ policies result
in a sustainable outcome.

Indeed, the main lesson from the crisis is the need
to find better ways of ensuring the right collective
outcome. Reforms to financial regulation and the
structure of the banking system need to take place in
order to prevent another financial crisis. Many of these
reforms are already underway. Improved financial
regulation will help to intermediate the flows
associated with global imbalances. But we cannot
expect too much of regulation: it may well be
circumvented or diluted over time, and there will be
leakages, both across borders and through the shadow
banking system. So the global economy will remain
vulnerable to the risks associated with imbalances

REBALANCING OF GLOBAL DEMAND
IS THE KEY TO A SUSTAINABLE
RECOVERY

All countries accept that global rebalancing is
necessary. But there is a clear difference between
the ex ante path of adjustment desired by the
surplus countries, which are faced with the need
for a structural shift away from reliance on exports,
and the ex ante path of adjustment preferred by the
deficit countries, which are under greater pressure to
reduce the burden of debt in both private and public
sectors. Talk of currency conflicts is a symptom of a
deeper disagreement on the appropriate time path of
real adjustment. The reason this matters is that, since
surpluses and deficits must add to zero for the world
as a whole, differences between these desired ex ante
adjustment paths are reconciled ex post by changes
in the level of world output. And the risk is that
unless agreement on a common path of adjustment
is reached, conflicting policies will result in that
ex post path taking place at an undesirably low level
of world output.

Global imbalances: the perspective of the Bank of England
Mervyn King

Today’s IMFS has become distorted. The major
surplus and deficit countries are pursuing economic
strategies that are in direct conflict. And there are
some innocent victims. Those emerging market
economies which have adopted floating currencies
are now suffering from the attempts of other
countries to hold down their exchange rates, and are
experiencing uncomfortable rates of capital inflows
and currency appreciation. So there is more to this
issue than a bilateral conflict between China and
the United States.
Current exchange rate tensions illustrate the
resistance to the relative price changes that are
necessary for a successful rebalancing. The need to
act in the collective interest has yet to be recognised,
and, unless it is, it will be only a matter of time before
one or more countries resort to protectionism as the
only domestic instrument to support a necessary
rebalancing. That could, as it did in the 1930s, lead
to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world.
Every country would suffer ruinous consequences.
But, to borrow a phrase, in order to be tough on
protectionism, we need also to be tough on the causes
of protectionism.
So what needs to be done? I would suggest
two principles for the way ahead. First, focus
discussion on the underlying disagreement about
the right speed of adjustment to the real pattern
of spending. This discussion should be informed
by countries’ ability to follow that path in a

sustainable way. Without agreement on this, policies
will inevitably conflict. Once broad agreement is
reached, it should then be easier to agree on the
instruments of policy. Second, in terms of policy
instruments, put on the table many potential policy
measures – not just the single issue of exchange rates.
That should include, in addition to exchange rates,
rules of the game for controlling capital inflows, more
efficient means for countries to self insure, plans
to raise saving in the deficit countries, structural
reforms to boost demand in the surplus countries and
even the role and governance of the international
financial institutions.
What is needed now is a “grand bargain” among
the major players in the world economy. A bargain
that recognises the benefits of compromise on the
real path of economic adjustment in order to avoid
the damaging consequences of a move towards
protectionism. Exchange rates will have to be part
of such a bargain, but they logically follow a higher
level agreement on rebalancing and sustaining a high
level of world demand.
A natural forum in which to strike a bargain is the G20
Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced
Growth. So far, the process has failed to achieve
a move to a better outcome. If we cannot achieve
cooperation voluntarily then a more rules-based
automatic system may need to be considered
to restore global demand and to maintain future
global economic and financial stability.

Global imbalances contributed to the financial crisis and a rebalancing of global demand is the key to
a sustainable recovery. While financial regulation will help to intermediate the flows associated with
global imbalances, it has limitations. If we, collectively, do not deal with these problems at best we will
have a weak world recovery and at worst we will sow the seeds of the next financial crisis. It is in our
hands to avoid both those outcomes.
