Thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you this evening. The University of Bristol is a very fine
institution in a very fine city and I have extremely fond memories of my time there from 1977 to 1980 as a
student in Economics with Statistics. In music at that time we had the latter stages of punk rock, and Bristol
was also very good for folk music; in football I remember watching Bristol City playing Tottenham at Ashton
Gate in what was then the true First Division; and in the economy there was continuing economic and social
unrest (the Winter of Discontent) with inflation and unemployment stubbornly high. I recall a flatmate
conducting a survey of students’ inflation expectations in 1978 when RPI inflation had just fallen below 8%
for the first time since 1972. Unemployment was thought to be high at the time, as a result of the first oil
crisis but was to take a further upwards lurch in the early 80s and I remember how lucky I was to get a
research job at Warwick University when I left Bristol – having spent the summer of 1980 painting rusty
trolleys in a factory, which was itself knocked down to create housing later in the 80s.

Whilst these may appear to be self-indulgent memories, the comparison of the economy then and now does
provide a thoughtful backdrop for what I want to discuss with you this evening. Compared with the economy
in the 70s, maybe things aren’t as bad now as we sometimes like to believe! The first topic I want to cover
will be what central banks can do to help achieve the holy grail of low inflation, stable growth and full
employment. In particular I will take a monetary approach to explaining the issues. Second, I want to talk
about the monetary policy decisions facing us right now and explain my own recent voting position. Third, I
want to give an update on our latest initiative, the ‘Funding for Lending Scheme’.

Money and the Balance Sheet of the Central Bank

In the Acknowledgements to his 1988 classic ‘A Brief History of Time’, Stephen Hawking notes that he was
told that each equation he included in the book would halve its sales. He only included one.1 You may be
relieved to hear that there are no equations in this talk tonight. But I mention this because I am going to refer
regularly to something which has been empirically proven to send some journalists to sleep faster than
counting sheep. The Bank of England’s balance sheet. I hope you are all still awake? Good, because the
Bank’s balance sheet is actually where all the action is. It is what allows the Bank to deliver its core
functions including the issuance of banknotes, implementing monetary policy, and acting as lender of last
resort to the banking system. Only the central bank can undertake these tasks because the central bank is
the monopoly supplier of domestic currency: sterling in the UK. In this context (leaving aside the small stock
of coins in circulation2) sterling means banknotes and commercial bank reserves held at the Bank of
England, which in combination comprise ‘base’ or ‘narrow money’3. Notes and reserve balances form the
vast majority of the liability side of the Bank’s balance sheet (see Chart 1) and these two types of money
provide the ultimate means of settling payments between individuals, commercial firms, the Government and
banks. I will talk about broader concepts of money, including commercial bank deposits, a little later. The

Bank of England can control the amount of sterling liabilities it issues and thus decide the amount of narrow
money in the economy and/or its price. That is unique to the central bank and is the fundamental operational
tool we have to implement monetary policy.

In addition to controlling the size of our balance sheet and/or the price of money, which may affect the total
supply of credit in the economy directly, we can alter the composition of the assets held on the Bank’s
balance sheet, or conduct off-balance sheet operations, and so affect the composition of private sector asset
holdings. Executed judiciously, we can thus influence the price and/or quantity of particular types of credit in
the economy.

Finally, by talking about what we might do in the future, the Bank can influence the price and quantity of
money and credit for some time to come. The power of communications as an operational tool should not be
underestimated and the MPC has always used a range of communication channels to help accomplish its
objectives.
I should also note that, from April 1st this year, the new Financial Policy Committee (the FPC) of the Bank will
also have statutory responsibility and powers to make the financial system more resilient through
macroprudential policies,4 and the Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA) within the Bank of England will
take over from the Financial Services Authority the job of micro-prudential supervision of firms. These
functions do not depend on the central bank balance sheet and so, in principle, do not need to be
undertaken by the central bank. But they are being put in the central bank for very good reasons, which

include, for example, exploiting the synergies with central bank operations and skills, and eliminating the
underlaps that arise from separate institutional arrangements. Because they do not necessarily involve the
Bank in conducting financial operations, I will say no more about macro- or micro-prudential polices today.
(Else I will still be going at midnight!)

In summary, the primary operational policy levers available to the Bank of England to influence the
macroeconomic outlook are: setting the price or quantity of money; influencing the price and quantity of
credit; and the communication of our actions, analysis and views5. Let me unpack these policy operations a
little further.

Our monetary policy objective is set in the annual Inflation Target Remit given to us in a letter from the
Chancellor.6 The Remit requires the Monetary Policy Committee to target a 2% inflation rate in the
Consumer Price Index, but it is also made clear that we should avoid ‘undesirable volatility in output’ which
might arise from ‘external events or temporary difficulties’ beyond the control of the monetary framework.
In order to steer inflation towards the 2% target, in effect we can control either the price or the supply of
narrow money. Prior to 2009, we would set Bank Rate and then adjust the supply of commercial bank
reserves to guide overnight interest rates towards it. To do this the Bank would conduct Open Market
Operations (OMOs) in which we lend to, or borrow from, the commercial banks so as to increase or decrease
the level of reserve balances in aggregate, in line with the banks’ stated targets. We would adjust those
operations precisely to ensure that short-term market rates are driven towards the rate we pay on those
reserve balances – which is Bank Rate. Since we also charge Bank Rate in our routine OMOs, Bank Rate is
essentially the anchoring price of short term money. I am not going to go into details tonight about the
precise economic mechanisms which make overnight market rates converge on Bank Rate, but there is
plenty of technical material available on that if you wish to know precisely how that works.7

In my first week as Markets Director of the Bank of England, in March 2009, we set Bank Rate at 0.5%
where it has remained ever since; a record low for the policy rate in the Bank’s history of over 300 years.
Since that left little scope to adjust the price of money downwards directly, we switched at that point to
directly affecting the supply of narrow money. The Asset Purchase Programme - more popularly called
‘Quantitative Easing’ or just ‘QE’ – has since reached of total of £375bn, the vast majority of which has been
by purchasing gilts, financed by increasing the supply of reserve balances (net of other flows across the
Bank’s balance sheet – see Charts 1 and 2).

I will leave aside the issuance of banknotes, the quantity of which passively reflects demand by the public.

The economics of QE is actually more simple than is often portrayed: by buying a large amount of assets
from the market, in exchange for cash, we can greatly increase the amount of sterling in the economy. We
inject the most liquid asset of all – short-term sterling reserve balances – and take out of circulation a
long-maturity, less liquid asset, gilts. That switch in maturity and liquidity leads to a range of effects, as the
economy has to rebalance its holdings of financial assets. As people try to move out of cash deposits and
into typically higher yielding assets, QE will reduce liquidity and term premia, push up a range of asset prices
and bring down interest rates at a wide range of maturities. All of that will benefit borrowers, increase wealth
and help to stimulate nominal demand. Injecting money is actually not so different from cutting its price
(Bank Rate).

There are some very important caveats however and I will focus on three. First, monetary stimulus works by
giving an incentive to businesses and households to spend now rather than in the future. That creates only
a temporary boost to growth. To carry on influencing growth, the stimulus needs to get ever larger. But we
know that ultimately, the sustainable growth rate in the economy depends not on monetary conditions but on
real factors. I shall return to this point later. Second, and relatedly, a monetary injection can create extra
nominal demand for goods and services, but the precise split between real growth and price inflation is
unfortunately out of our control. Taking these two points together, the creation of extra money can surely be
relied on to prevent deflation, but even if it provides a temporary boost to real activity it can’t guarantee
sustaining a particular real growth rate. Third, the split into prices and real output and the overall outturn for
the economy, depend on what else is happening at the same time: monetary policy is just one of the various
forces at work shaping the pressures on output and inflation. We don’t conduct monetary policy in a
scientific laboratory where everything else can be held constant.

QE is often described as being a great experiment. In fact, the theory of monetary policy in the economic
textbooks that I was brought up with at Bristol, and later, all considered the supply of money to be the central
bank’s primary policy instrument. The use of interest rates to set monetary policy appeared to be viewed by
many academic authors as something of a slightly unfortunate and uninteresting practicality8.

I want to be clear about one very important point: for monetary policy to stimulate the economy, the Bank of
England has to cut interest rates and/or increase the supply of money. That gives firms and households an
incentive to spend rather than to save. And it works in part by shifting net interest income from those who do
save to those who borrow (and hence are more likely to spend out of marginal income). Not surprisingly,
loosening monetary policy is often unpopular with savers, just as tightening policy is unpopular with
borrowers. We have every sympathy for those who are net savers and especially if they rely on investment
income, but we have to set policy for the good of the economy as a whole, in line with our Remit. Ultimately,
economic recovery is in everyone’s interests.

Monetary policy famously has ‘long and variable lags’. One of the main reasons why is because the demand
for money depends on many other factors in the economy outside of the central bank’s control. There are
other forms of money apart from sterling as I have defined it so far. Economic activity is also supported by
the extent of deposits created by the commercial banks. Various measures of this are available, usually
labelled “broad money” and the definition most commonly used in the UK is known as M49. Ideally, that
wider definition of money is what we would like to boost to ensure an increase in nominal demand for goods
and services.

In the UK it has been clear over the past four years that while we have been busy increasing the supply of
narrow money, the growth of broad money has remained weak. Broad money demand will fall if individuals
or firms use the increased cash injected into the system to pay down bank debts, or simply seek to borrow
less. Similarly the supply side of broad money can contract if banks consciously shrink their balance sheets.
That would happen, for example, if the banks are short of capital or funding, or simply can’t earn sufficient
return on their assets. All of these demand and supply factors have been at work in recent years. As a
result, the balance of forces between the demand and supply of broad money against the injection of narrow
money has meant that growth in the stock of broad money in the economy has remained weak.

That does not mean that QE has been unsuccessful, as many commentators seem to conclude. Without
QE, the amount of broad money in the economy would clearly have shrunk much further than it did – it
actually held up reasonably well while the economy was contracting. Had broad money shrunk a lot further,
the resulting deflation would have meant that the outcomes for output and employment in the UK would have
been far, far worse than they have been. I will say more on the causes of deflationary forces a bit later, but
this analysis partly explains why the Bank of England has also been engaged on special operations to
support the liquidity, funding and capital positions of the banks through, respectively, the Special Liquidity
Scheme, the Funding for Lending Scheme and the capital recommendations by the FPC.

What of our ability to influence credit markets directly? I want to argue that it largely reflects how we go
about changing the supply of money. On the one hand, to increase the quantity of money in scale, quickly
and safely, it is quite clear that gilts are the best instrument to buy: there is a large market and there is no
resultant private sector credit risk taken by the public sector. Many financial instruments tend to be priced by
reference to the interest rates on sovereign debt and so changing gilt yields will have effects across sterling
markets.

In addition to buying gilts to inject money, we can consider two other ways to affect credit markets. First we
can buy financial instruments outright. If particular markets have become dysfunctional so that general
monetary expansion doesn’t help, relatively small amounts of direct purchases may unblock the relevant
markets. Second we can lend liquid assets – including cash - against assets that are, or have become

illiquid. That is what we did with the Special Liquidity Scheme and more recently the Funding for Lending
Scheme.
In 2009 the Bank launched two schemes making outright purchases of assets other than gilts.10 We started
to buy sterling commercial paper (up to 3 months maturity) and investment grade corporate bonds. At that
time, in the worst conditions of the recession, the markets for these financial instruments had not been
functioning normally. An increased demand for liquidity and heightened concerns about counterparty risk,
caused many markets to dry up and asset prices to fall. By intervening as ‘Market Maker of Last Resort’ the
Bank was able, over about a 12-18 month period, to support the markets for both commercial paper and
corporate bonds and drive prices back to more appropriate levels. The commercial paper scheme came to a
natural end as prices rose and our holdings – which peaked at about £2.4bn in 2009 – matured. The
corporate bond scheme is still in operation. Each week we offer to buy from a list of bonds, or sell from our
stock. After reaching a peak in 2010 of some £1.5bn in holdings, the revitalized market has steadily bought
the bonds back from us so that our stock is now only around £20mn.

Curiously, we still get people advocating the purchase of corporate bonds in large scale as well as gilts. But
it is not clear to me what this would be intended to achieve. Apart from the simple fact that the Bank is
already in the market every week offering to buy corporate bonds, and we have been doing that for nearly
four years, this aspect of the capital markets is functioning well in terms of providing credit to businesses.
Any firm that has an issuance programme – typically the larger firms with credit ratings - can issue whenever
and whatever bonds they choose at historically low interest rates. The backstop to corporate bonds provided
by the Bank’s operations is still there – but it is not being used much because it is not needed.

The power to intervene in credit markets is one to use cautiously. Any intervention by the public sector
carries the risk of creating distortions. Usually, we intervene because there is a demonstrable failure of
private markets – so that the central bank is undoing distortions caused by other factors. Buying private
sector paper also carries the risk of credit losses – ultimately of public money. And it is a very short step to
cross the boundary from seeking to improve credit supply generally to determining the credit allocation
between individual borrowers – which the central bank is neither equipped nor empowered to do. That is
best left to private markets.

When a central bank – or any public authority – takes actions, it has to remember that the precedent of that
action can be as powerful as the action itself. Market participants – and indeed the general public – will learn
about the authorities’ behaviour and shape their own accordingly. Moral hazard is one aspect of this – that
can lead to market participants taking more risky actions because of the perceived backstop provided by the
central bank.

More generally, communications strategies can be a positive part of the toolkit, in particular by giving out
information about the central bank’s monetary policy ‘reaction function’. For the most part it is helpful for
markets to be able to predict what the central bank will do. That way one can often hope to generate the
desired responses with less severe policy actions than otherwise. Credibility matters. For example, if people
believe that inflation will be 2% in the medium term, and act accordingly, it is much more likely that inflation
will stay close to 2% in practice without big swings in monetary policy. Keeping inflation under control is
much more costly for the economy if expectations become de-anchored from the official target.

But how explicit do we need to be about our forward plans? This is a very live policy debate. The recovery
in financial markets that we have seen in the past 6 months or so, is in part driven by the statement that the
ECB will do ‘whatever it takes’ to keep the euro area together and the perceived commitment that the Fed
will do whatever it takes to restore growth in the US. The belief in these policy approaches has been
immensely powerful. But it must be backed not only by perceived intent but also by capability and delivery if
needed - and economies always generate some surprises. If the actions don’t follow the words when
necessary, then similar policy statements in future will be less effective.

In the UK, market expectations are already consistent with monetary policy remaining very supportive for
some time to come, indicating no change in Bank Rate until well into 2015. Yet there is still a debate about
whether the MPC should give more ‘forward guidance’. In practice we have being doing this through the
Inflation Report. The most recent edition makes it clear that we do not see much pressure arising from
domestically generated inflation. Rather, we continue to see inflation being driven by factors such as tax
changes, higher commodity and energy prices, and other external influences. These and similar adverse
relative price changes have made us all financially worse off and contributed to keeping inflation higher than
target over the past few years. In response, the Bank could have chosen to tighten monetary policy to keep
measured inflation rates down. But that would have meant deliberately trying to weaken output growth and
seeking to raise unemployment so that domestic inflationary pressures were lower. The relative price
changes would still have happened, albeit at a lower overall inflation rate (wage growth would also have
been lower). That would not have been consistent with the Remit that the MPC has been given and I doubt
it would have been a more attractive outcome to most people.

The current policy debate

Despite the medium-term limitations of monetary policy, my own view is that QE has nevertheless been a
powerful force in supporting the economy at crucial points over the past 4 ½ years. Given the shocks that
have hit the UK since 2008, and the dependence of the UK on financial services, output could have fallen
much, much further than the 6% fall from peak to trough that is actually recorded, and the unemployment
rate could easily have peaked well into double figures instead of the 8 ½% that actually transpired. But I
have also made clear that I do not think monetary policy can itself guarantee sustained real growth in the
medium-term. It can provide a temporary stimulus and the right monetary conditions for a recovery, but
8

sustained real growth will depend on real factors such as real external demand for UK-produced goods and
services. We need real productivity growth to make UK production competitive and we need real supply-side
reforms to boost expected future real incomes. Monetary policy can help, and it can underpin the economy
by preventing a slide into deflation. So support from monetary policy is necessary but won’t be sufficient to
restore sustained real growth until these real determinants are also pushing the economy forwards.

One way to think about what has happened during the past 4 years is that there has been a need for balance
sheet rebuilding across the economy. The shocks of 2008 revealed that many parts of the economy had
become over-extended: some UK commercial banks are still rebuilding their balance sheets; the
Government will take several more years to rebalance expenditure and income; households are still
increasing savings rather than spending in aggregate; and some corporates are reluctant - or unable – to
take on new debts. And given a very large trade deficit built up prior to the crisis, the overall UK economy
had to rebalance, away from domestic demand towards net exports. These are real adjustments that need
to be made within the economy. Growth should return, but it is likely that growth can only be sustained at a
satisfying pace once the drag on demand and supply from rebalancing lessens. Monetary policy can play a
supporting role because the extra liquidity in the economy allows the necessary rebalancing to happen
without a disorderly adjustment (eg in asset prices). But patience will be required.

One detailed factor that has complicated monetary policy recently is the effects on measured retail price
inflation of regulated and administered prices such as above-inflation rises in utility bills, university tuition
fees, rail fares etc. Individually these may be perfectly sensible public policy choices and I do not want to be
interpreted as criticising their motivation. But the effect on CPI inflation is important. These prices – which
are about 16% of the CPI basket – will contribute around one percentage point to the CPI inflation rate in the
next couple of years, largely regardless of what happens to domestic demand. Pushing inflation down to 2%
would require very low price rises in the other 84%. The risk of overall deflation is much less likely as a
result.

At our February meeting we faced, as so often in the recent past, a difficult choice. Should we offer more
monetary stimulus, or should we not? My own choice, on a balanced assessment of the risks, was that we
could and should do more now to support a nascent recovery with a further monetary injection. I do not
believe the assertions of those who claim that that QE is noticeably less powerful than previously – although
I have noted that there are limits to what monetary policy can be expected to achieve on real growth and it is
impossible to measure the impact of monetary policy with any degree of precision. As with changing interest
rates, the precise effects will always depend on the state of the economy. I judge that there are some upside
risks to inflation, should confidence about achieving the 2% inflation target in the medium run be lost. But
there are also downside risks if growth remains very subdued. As long as medium-term inflation
expectations do remain consistent with our objective – in particular as long as wage growth remains so weak
- I believe that we can and should continue to support the economy through the supply of money. But there
is a case for taking a slightly longer-term approach than previously.

Because of the underpinning from regulated and administered prices, and the fact that the economy is
currently flat rather than contracting, I think the risk of deflation is considerably reduced. Rather than a very
large, rapid programme of asset purchases to avoid an imminent slump – as was needed in 2009 and again
in 2011/12 - a slower, more gradually supportive policy might be more appropriate and less risky to nurse the
economy through the next phase of recovery. It is sustained momentum that the economy needs now rather
than emergency action.

Because of that, in February I voted for an additional £25bn over 3 months thinking that this could be the first
instalment of a more prolonged run of purchases at a somewhat slower pace than previously, and with a
relatively modest addition to the total by the end. If we were to do that, then it would be straightforward to
accelerate or to stop purchases as the economic outlook developed and the risks became clearer. In fact
this is not so different from what we have done before. Although we have always decided on asset
purchases for a 3 or 4 month period at a time, we have often rolled into further purchases. The total amount
is only decided – and then only temporarily - at the point we stop! So we could contemplate a rather longer
horizon for asset purchases, even if we continue to cautiously decide on a few months at a time.

The majority of the MPC took a view in February not to make any more purchases. I accept that there was a
good case to be made for that position, even if on balance I took a different view. But I think we need to
keep under review whether there is merit in undertaking more asset purchases under a slightly different
dynamic approach. Indeed the February meeting Minutes made it clear that the Committee will keep all its
options open.

Funding for Lending

Finally, I want to turn to our most recent approach to credit easing. The Funding for Lending Scheme (the
FLS) was launched in 2012 jointly with HM Treasury after we saw that interest rates being charged to
borrowers had been rising at a time when our asset purchase programme should have been bearing down
on market rates. The principal reason for rising lending rates was that bank funding costs were being kept
high by the continuing crisis in the euro area.

The FLS offers banks cheap funding for up to 4 years – with the price linked to how much lending a bank
makes to UK firms and households. It is carefully designed to provide incentives to all banks to lend more
than they would have done in its absence. The actual mechanism is a liquidity upgrade as we lend 9-month
Treasury bills against illiquid loan collateral.11 The Treasury bills can easily and cheaply be converted into
cash, thus reducing the banks’ reliance on more expensive market funding.

11

Technically this is a collateral swap, and in line with good accounting practice it is not recorded on balance sheet. But there is full
quarterly disclosure, bank-by-bank.
10

10

How successful has it been? The impact comes in three phases. First of all the FLS tackles the problem at
source by cutting the funding costs of banks. That phase has been remarkably successful. Market-based
measures of UK bank funding costs have fallen across all sources: secured and unsecured term debt;
inter-bank borrowing; deposit rates and so on. It has no doubt helped that coincidental developments in
Europe have brought down bank funding costs there. But in the UK they fell quickly once the FLS was first
announced, and generally by more for UK banks than for their European peer group.

The next stage is for banks to pass on lower funding costs to their customers. This is happening, albeit a bit
more slowly. Of course it is only the banks’ marginal funding costs which are reduced. Their pre-existing
stock of funding will reflect historical borrowing costs. So the largest falls in loan costs are directed at new
lending, rather than the stock. The impact is also more obvious on mortgage than on corporate lending.
Three quarters of total lending is to households rather than to firms, and it is easier for banks to launch new
offers in that sector. In the corporate sector, we have seen banks take different approaches to SME lending:
one bank offers a cash back scheme; another has scrapped arrangement fees; a third is offering guaranteed
discounted borrowing costs. The true impact for corporate customers is not easily measured in ‘standard’
interest rate data, but the potential economic benefit is there. Overall, we think there is more action to come
in lower lending rates.

The final stage is the impact of lower lending rates on the quantity of credit. That will take some time to work
through from applications to approvals to actual lending and is the most uncertain leg. The FLS has clearly
shifted the supply of credit: loans are generally available at lower cost than previously. That in itself is a
monetary boost as new borrowers will be better off than they were before because they are paying lower
interest rates. But whether there is more borrowing in total will depend on the demand for credit and the
creditworthiness of borrowers. If firms or households, for whatever reason, are reluctant to borrow, a change
in the marginal interest rate may not make much difference. For example I have personally heard from small
firms who say they do not want to ‘get in hock to their banks again’ and so they are turning to alternative
funding sources or simply not investing at all.

And from the lender’s point of view, they still have to judge the chances of getting their money back. Again
this is more complicated for lending to businesses than for households – especially small businesses which
are much more diverse. At the margin there will be some individual business credits which look a better bet
at a lower interest rate, but some other businesses won’t get credit at any price. In aggregate, corporate
lending is also probably being held back by the fact that the commercial property market is still weak. Nearly
50% of bank and building society lending to corporates is to the property sector and a good part of the rest
will be secured on property. Given losses suffered by most banks on their commercial property portfolios,
they are reluctant to increase lending for that purpose. Finally, some banks have had to cut back particular
forms of lending as a result of State Aid rulings, so they will struggle not to reduce their total lending, even if
they use the FLS to the full to support their core activities.

11

We do need to keep the pressure on the banks individually and collectively to make sure that they continue
to pass through lower funding costs and are lending where they can. The Bank has made the funds
available to support lending to UK households and businesses, it is up to the banks to deliver. That is one
reason why we are publishing bank-by-bank outcomes under the Scheme.

We wait to see what the impact is of the FLS on the stock of lending. The next data release on 4 March will
be for end-December data. Even though lending rates have fallen, that is still quite early for much extra
money to have flowed from the application stage into actual loans, compared with previous plans which
showed that lending was most likely to fall in aggregate without the FLS. I would not expect to see a return
to rising aggregate quantities until we start getting data for 2013 at the earliest. Indeed the aggregate data
which have been published already – for all banks, not just those in the FLS - showed a small fall for the last
quarter of 2012. Nevertheless, it does seem that we have the beginnings of a revival in mortgage activity
which is visible in the approvals data and that trend is widely supported by business contacts throughout the
country.

The underlying message from the FLS is much the same as for monetary policy. Monetary and credit
policies can help provide the foundations for growth and ease the path for necessary real adjustments. But
ultimately, the growth of the economy will depend on real factors such as expectations of real income growth
and the productivity of UK firms and workers. Households will borrow for housing or consumption if they
have expectations of secure real incomes. Firms will similarly borrow if they have expectations of demand
for their goods and services. Cheaper loan rates will help that process, but the fundamental drivers will still
be those of the real economy.

Conclusion

The headwinds holding back the UK economy over recent years have been predominately real ones: an
ongoing crisis in our main export markets of Europe; the necessity of fiscal consolidation at home; the need
for rebalancing of the UK economy towards net exports; and balance sheet repair across all sectors. The
weak relative performance of the financial services sector following the crisis has also been a direct drag on
output as well as hampering the supply of credit. The central expectation in the February Inflation Report
was for growth to resume in 2013, albeit at a relatively modest pace. Patience will be needed. Meanwhile,
the Monetary Policy Committee remains committed to supporting the economy whilst aiming to keep inflation
low and stable in the medium term, in line with our Remit. Monetary policy can help, even if it can’t solve all
the challenges of restoring sustainable real growth.
