Chart 2 Agents’ survey: expected average pay settlement(a)

(a) The 2010 survey asked respondents: ‘What is your average pay settlement likely to be in 2010?’. The 2009 survey asked the same question for settlements in 2009. Responses
are weighted by respondents’ number of employees.
(b) Based on 272 responses (covering about 550,000 employees) to a survey of companies by the Bank of England’s regional Agents in December 2008 and January 2009.
(c) Based on 262 responses (covering about 550,000 employees) to a survey of companies by the Bank of England’s regional Agents in January 2010.

The impact is measured by the change over two days in the average 5 to 25 year (zero coupon) spot rate. The event dates are the publication of the February
Inflation Report and the associated press conference, which was taken to suggest a policy of quantitative easing was imminent; the decision at the March MPC
meeting to use the Asset Purchase Facility as a monetary policy tool for initial asset purchases of £75bn; and the subsequent extensions of planned purchases to
£125bn in May, to £175bn in August and to £200bn in November.

Chart 4 Imports and import-weighted demand(a)	


Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.

(b) Excluding the estimated impact of MTIC fraud.
(c) Import-weighted demand is calculated by weighting household consumption (including non-profit institutions serving households), whole-economy investment
(excluding valuables), government spending, stockbuilding (excluding the alignment adjustment) and exports by their respective import intensities.
The import intensities are estimated using the 1995 ONS Input-Output Analytical Tables.
