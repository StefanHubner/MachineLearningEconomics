Note: The chart shows how the yield on an index of US-dollar investment-grade corporate bonds (in orange) splits into two components. The first component (in blue) is the risk-free
interest rate, which reflects expected Federal Funds rates over a period equal to the (7-year) duration of the index. The second component (in purple) is the difference between the yield
and the first component, and reflects the term premium and credit spread.

Note: The charts show fitted densities of CDS premia and default probability estimates for corporate debts referenced in the current CDX.NA.IG credit default swap index. The CDS
premia are annual amounts on five-year senior CDS contracts and the default probabilities are aggregates of one-year ahead estimates constructed by financial institutions following
an internal-ratings-based approach to regulation.

Sources: ICE BofAML, Bloomberg, HMT and Bank calculations.
Note: The chart shows GBP investment-grade corporate bond yield and the expected risk free rate (based on a maturity (7 years) that is similar to the duration of the corporate bond index
over the period shown). The difference between the corporate bond yield and the expected rate is the term premium plus the credit spread. The adjusted sterling investment-grade spread
accounts for changes in credit quality and duration of the index over time.
