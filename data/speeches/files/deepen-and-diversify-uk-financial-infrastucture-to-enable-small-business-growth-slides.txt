the last crisis is worthwhile, but, our

What also needs to happen to make
sure that the British banking system

Diversify and deepen UK sources of

How to do more
• In my September 2011 speech,
speech I
urged creation of two UK institutions:
– a bank
b kd
dedicated
di t d tto SME llending;
di
– a securitizing entity for SME loans;
– enabled by HMG and Bank efforts

• The issue is the lending infrastructure
– Call it ‘credit easing’, fine; Re-purpose
existing
i ti publicly
bli l controlled
t ll d banks,
b k fi
fine.
– But let’s really move forward and do
something to deepen credit markets

Practical goals for a new
British SME credit infrastructure
• We need to end up with more diversity and
competition in corporate finance, but moves so far
are insufficient in this direction
• Some additional measures to pursue
– Standardizing and easing loan applications and due
diligence as a public good for SMEs
– Creating an actuarial database of SME lending or
making
ki it
i available
il bl ffrom credit
di scoring
i experts
– Creating of a junk bond market and a securitized lending
market for SME loans
– Either creating more new banks or getting old (bad)
loans off of the books of the existing banks faster
11

Some progress has been made
• I applaud the emergence of the Business
Growth Fund, of the Business Finance
Partnership scheme, and of new entrants to
the UK banking system
• It is worth considering some subsidized
lending to SMEs, and proposals for a
national infrastructure bank
• We will only have done enough when we
see the gap between SME/big lending
narrow, and when competition provokes
changes in lending behavior by big banks

Yes, there is a public role
in credit infrastructure
• There’s too much fear of a public role in
creating financial infrastructure and
seeding the capital
– lots of countries have public lenders
– central banks can discount loans without
choosing who to lend to

• Moreover, the crisis we are in was due to
private misallocation of funds
• Like at Kew Gardens,, we should let a
thousand different flowers bloom – but
first y
you have to p
plant and fertilize them
14

Serving growth and stability
simultaneously in the UK
• We need to have a more diverse set of
corporate financing institutions, and more
competition among them, for the sake of the
real economy
– SME and new business lending is critical to
innovation and employment

• We need a more diverse and competitive
financial system for stability reasons, too
– As argued by Haldane, Turner, and the ICB

• And we can increase demand in the short-run
by improving supply in the long-run
long run this way
without much public risk or expenditure
