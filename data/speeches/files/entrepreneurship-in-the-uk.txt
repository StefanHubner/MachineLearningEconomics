Abstract

This paper examines the causes and consequences of changes in the incidence
of entrepreneurship in the UK. Self-employment as a proportion of total
employment is high by international standards in the United Kingdom, but the
share has fluctuated over time. We examine the time series movements in
self-employment, which are principally driven by financial liberalisation and
changes in taxation rules, especially as they relate to the construction sector
which is the dominant sector. We document that the median earnings of the
self-employed is less than for employees. We show that in comparison with
employees the self-employed are more likely to be male; immigrants; work in
construction or financial activities; hold an apprenticeship; work in London;
work long hours; have high levels of job satisfaction and happiness.
Consistent with the existence of capital constraints on potential and actual
entrepreneurs, the estimates imply that the probability of self-employment
depends positively upon whether the individual ever received an inheritance
or gift. Evidence is also found that rising house prices have increased the selfemployment rate. There appears to be no evidence that changes in selfemployment are correlated with changes in real GDP, nor national happiness.

This paper examines the causes and consequences of changes in the incidence of
entrepreneurship in the United Kingdom. But an initial question must be: how many entrepreneurs
are there? The answer is not straightforward. There are several ways of counting them. The
simplest is to count the number of self-employed workers, but even that is difficult. We could
count those that self report their employment status, such as in the Labour Force Survey (LFS).1
Or we could count the number of individuals who declare self-employment income for taxation
purposes. It would be useful to do both and see if the numbers equate. They do not. In fact, the
number of people who declare taxable income from self-employment in the United Kingdom is
roughly 50% greater than the number that say they are self-employed. Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs (HMRC) records just over 4.5 million individuals declaring some income from selfemployment in 2003/4, but the LFS records just over 3 million self-employed workers. This is not
that surprising.
It is clear that many individuals have more than one job, so the number of individuals
reporting self-employed earnings for taxation purposes should be expected to be higher than the
number that say they are self-employed. It is also likely that in some instances individuals will
struggle to identify whether they are principally an employee or self-employed. They could base
their decision on hours worked or income earned.

Or it could reflect the timing of survey

responses. A classic example is that of a free-lancing actor. Fifty-one weeks of the year they work
for a wage waiting tables in a restaurant. But by the survey reference week they have quit their job

The definition of self-employment in the Labour Force Survey is left entirely to the respondent, and with no guidance
or prompt. This could result in a lack of coherence with other measures of the self-employed, such as the Inland
Revenue’s Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) or with measures of jobs based largely on employer surveys, such as
workforce jobs. There is currently a consistency check to the LFS, carried out by the ONS, which recodes some
respondents’ employment status to employee if the occupation they claim to do is inconsistent with self-employment
(for example, self-employed policeman).

as a waiter and they star in a film for which they are paid one hundred times the wages they earned
as a waiter over the previous fifty one weeks. Are they self-employed or employed?
In this paper we focus primarily on the characteristics of the self-employed and how selfemployment has changed over time, principally in the United Kingdom, using the LFS.
Unfortunately these data do not record self-employed earnings. Consequently, we also make use of
the HMRC data as well as information from various Family Resources Surveys to compare
earnings of the self-employed with the wages and salaries earned by employees.
The most entrepreneurial individuals in the UK, such as Lakshmi Mittal, Sir Richard
Branson and Sir Alan Sugar, are generally not included in our surveys. A very small number of the
most entrepreneurial individuals are very important both in terms of wealth and job creation. What
distinguishes them from everyone else? As far as we can, with the limited data available, we
examine their characteristics too.
In what follows we first consider time series trends in self-employment in the UK and
elsewhere. Second, we compare the earnings of the self-employed with those of wage and salary
workers. Third, we examine the characteristics of the self-employed. Fourth we perform a series
of econometric analyses of the determinants of self-employment and draw comparisons with the
United States and the EU. Fifth we consider the importance of liquidity constraints and the role of
inheritances and gifts and rising house prices in overcoming these credit constraints. Sixth, we
examine macro-economic consequences and correlates of self-employment and draw a series of
conclusions. The aim of this paper is thus to identify the characteristics of the self-employed and
try to explain how and why their numbers have changed over time.

1. Time series trends
Self-employment as a proportion of total UK employment is especially high in comparison
with other OECD countries (Blanchflower, 2000, 2005).2 Table 1 reports data on the change in the
proportion of all workers who were self-employed in the decades since the 1960s for the OECD
countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Turkey, UK, USA). Data are taken from the OECD Labour Force Statistics. In the 1960s, the
highest proportions were found in Italy (36.4%), Korea (35.0%), Poland (34.5%), Ireland (30.1%)
and Austria (28.3%). The proportion of self-employed workers has subsequently fallen sharply in
all these countries, and most others. The only countries to have recorded increases in their selfemployment rates between the 1960s and 2000s (for which data are available) have been the United
Kingdom and New Zealand.3 The increase in the United Kingdom was +5.2pp while the increase
in New Zealand was 4.7pp.
A similar result holds in Table 2 for non-agricultural self-employment in these two
countries. However, there are now several additional countries for which the trend has been
upwards over the past 4 decades (or 3 where data for the 1960s is not available): Australia, Canada,
Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden.
Within these other countries it would appear that declines in agricultural self-employment have
shrouded an upward trend in self-employment across other sectors.

Moreover, the self-

employment rate falls by less (or increases in the case of those countries previously mentioned)

2

Alternatively, the total workforce can be used as the denominator, as in Weir (2003) or Taylor (2004). Movements in
the two series appear very similar over time.
3

The Norwegian rate did increase by 0.7pp, but has actually been falling since the 1970s.

3

across 24 of the 25 countries for which data are available when only those employed in nonagricultural activities are considered; the exception being Mexico. The difference is most apparent
in Poland, where the average non-agricultural self-employment rate was +9.0pp higher in the 2000s
than the average of the 1960s, compared with a -12.6pp fall when all workers are considered. The
change in the UK self-employment rate excluding agricultural workers is little different from that
including those workers. But the change in the New Zealand rate is nearly twice as large (+7.7pp
versus +4.7pp) when only those employed in non-agricultural activities are considered.
Table 3 sets out a time series of self-employment rates for the United Kingdom, based on
data published in various issues of the Employment Gazette between 1962 and 1991 (collected by
the Department of Employment and Productivity (1962-1970); and the Department of Employment
(1971-1991)), and subsequently data from the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS). In 2006, out of
28,959,000 workers, 3,753,000 or 13.0% of the labour force were classified as self-employed. This
figure has increased markedly in recent years, up from 11.9% in 2001. Between 2001 and 2006,
the number of employees increased by 3.5%, while the number of self-employed workers increased
by 13.7%. The self-employment rate has been higher than this, however. The rate peaked at just
over 14% in 1991, and remained around 13.5% during much of the early 1990s, before gradually
declining from 1997. But prior to the 1990s, the rate had been much lower. Using OECD data, the
average self-employment rate in the United Kingdom during the 1960s was 7.1%; the 1970s, 8.0%;
the 1980s, 10.8%; the 1990s, 13.3%; and the 2000s, 12.3%. These averages clearly indicate that
the period of most rapid growth in UK self-employment was during the 1980s. As a validation of
the changes in self-employment it is appropriate to look at VAT registrations published by the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).4 VAT registrations and deregistrations, according to the

4

The VAT data were also examined by Black, De Meza and Jeffreys (1996),

4

DTI, are “the best official guide to the pattern of business start-ups and closures”.5 The VAT
figures do not, however, give the complete picture of start-up and closure activity in the economy.
Some VAT exempt sectors and businesses operating below the threshold for VAT registration are
not covered. At the start of 2005, the VAT threshold was an annual turnover of £58,000, and only
1.8 million of the estimated 4.3 million enterprises in the UK were VAT-registered.

However,

some businesses do voluntarily register for VAT even though their turnover is below the threshold.
Data for 2005 shows that around a fifth of all registrations had turnover below the VAT threshold.
In 2005 there were 177,900 registrations and 152,900 de-registrations, resulting in an
increase of 25,000 (1.4%) in the stock of VAT registered enterprises. As can be seen below there
have been increases in the stock of VAT registrations in every year from 1995.

Chart 1 shows that these movements in VAT registrations loosely track the changes in selfemployment shown in Table 3 – the correlation is +.60.6 On both measures there were marked
declines in the period 1991-1994. However, the two series move in opposite directions between
1995 and 2002. The decline in the self-employment rate is primarily related to changes in the rules
of the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), which is the Inland Revenue’s taxation system for the
construction industry. Freedman (2001) noted that between 1995 and 1997, 200,000 construction
workers reclassified themselves as employees as a result of changes to the CIS. We discuss the
impact of changes in the CIS in more detail below.
It is also apparent that there have been significant changes in the size distribution of firms
registered for VAT. The table below shows that the number of firms increased by nearly 620,000
between 2000 and 2005, of which just over 570,000 (92.1%) were firms with no employees.

Note that increases in the VAT registration threshold in 1991 and 1993 mean the estimates are only broadly
comparable over the period 1980-2005.

Table 4 reports survival rates of VAT registered enterprises for up to 10 years for the UK
from 1995-2005. The probability of a firm surviving 10 years is approximately one third. Over
time the probability of survival has increased.
The late 1980s account for most of the increase in the number of entrepreneurs in the UK
economy – whether we define entrepreneurship using self-employment numbers or VAT
registrations. The number of self-employed workers rose by more than two hundred and thirty
thousand in each of the years 1986-1987, 1988-1989 and 1989-1990, while the 1987-1988 increase
was a still healthy, one hundred and fifty thousand. So between 1986 and 1990 the number of selfemployed grew by over eight hundred and fifty thousand, from 2.91 million to 3.76 million, while
the rate grew from 11.8% to 14.0%. It is apparent that 1984 was also an important year for growth,
with the largest (+266k) annual increase on record.
Sharp falls in both self-employment and VAT registrations followed in the early 1990s,
contemporaneous with the UK recession. The number of self-employed workers fell by -91k in
1991-1992, -208k in 1992-1993 and -58k in 1993-1994. It is notable, however, that the selfemployment rate did not start to fall until 1992, while the unemployment rate started to rise in late
1990. This indicates that employees felt the effects of the downturn in demand earlier than the selfemployed. The self-employment rate then stabilised for a period, before falling again.
The number of self-employed workers declined in all but two years between 1990 and
2000. This decline was dramatically reversed in 2003, when the number of self-employed workers
rose by +229k. A further 100k individuals became self-employed in 2006, causing the selfemployment rate to rise to 13.0%. VAT registrations also fell between 1997 and 2001 and then
increased subsequently.

7

The big increases in self-employment in the late-1980s occurred as unemployment was
declining sharply, while the falls of the early 1990s occurred as the labour market loosened. In
contrast, the 2001-2004 increase of more than three hundred thousand, alongside a jump of nearly
one percentage point in the rate (11.9% in 2001 to 12.8% in 2004), seems rather large given that
the unemployment rate declined by only 0.4pp, from 5.2% to 4.8%, over this period. So how is
self-employment related to the economic cycle?
It is well established that the employment rate tends to move pro-cyclically, while the
unemployment rate typically moves in the opposite direction. This inverse relationship is very
simple to explain. Every individual in the population (Pop) can be categorised into three groups:
employed (E), unemployed (U) or inactive (I). We can therefore write:
(1)

E + U + I = Pop

By dividing through by population and substituting the standard definitions for the employment
rate (e=E/Pop), unemployment rate (u= U/(U+E)) and the activity rate (a=(U+E)/Pop) into equation
(1), we can state:
(2)

e = a (1-u)

This says that the employment rate should be negatively correlated with the unemployment rate
given stable activity; which it is.
Self-employment is a significant component of total employment, so one might imagine
that movements in the self-employment rate should also be closely (inversely) correlated with
movements in the unemployment rate. But such a relationship is not clear in the United Kingdom.
Chart 2 shows that while there was a strong negative correlation between 1984 and 1994 (-0.75),
the correlation over the 35 years since 1971 has been positive (+0.41). Furthermore, Chart 3 shows
that the self-employment rate and total employment rate are actually negatively correlated over the

8

same period. In other words, the self-employment rate is not well correlated with the economic
cycle and the inverse relationship between employment and unemployment between 1971 and
1984, and since 1994, is driven entirely by forms of employment other than self-employment. Why
might this occur?
There are two distinct types of self-employed workers: those that choose (‘pulled’) to
become self-employed because of economic prosperity; and those that are pushed into selfemployment because of economic adversity. Chart 4 captures the rate of transition of workers
‘pulled’ into self-employment over the economic cycle using micro-data from the Labour Force
Survey. The transition rate clearly rises in periods of economic expansion. For example, 8.2% of
self-employed workers in 2006 had been employees in 2005. This translates into a flow of 308,000
workers. This may seem high, but one has to remember that a significant proportion of new
businesses fail within a year, so there will be a flow out of self-employment too. Table 4 shows
that 7.9% of new VAT registered businesses started in 2002 had failed in the first 12 months of
trading according to the DTI, and around 30% had failed within the first 3 years. This means that
the flow into self-employment must be high in order for the self-employment rate to even remain
stable.
In contrast, Chart 5 shows that the rate of transition of unemployed workers into selfemployment falls during periods of economic expansion. For example, just 1.4% of self-employed
workers in 2006 had been unemployed in 2005, but the proportion was 3.1% in 1993, when the
unemployment rate was at its previous peak. Chart 6 shows the transition from out of the labour
force (OLF), which is uncorrelated with the unemployment rate over the long run.
The self-employment rate is clearly a function of both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors, which are
related in opposite ways to measures of the economic cycle. It would therefore appear that the two

9

effects cancel each other out to a degree over long periods and cause the self-employment rate to be
uncorrelated with the economic cycle. However, it is also the case that other factors are more
likely to dominate the decision to become self-employed. During the 1980s and early 1990s, selfemployment was stimulated in the United Kingdom through changes in: industrial composition,
stemming from shifts in relative demand; technological advancements; government policy; and
financial markets. We now look at these in turn.
a) Industrial composition
Probably most importantly, the industrial composition of the UK economy started to
change. The contribution from service sector industries to total GVA rose from 57% in 1985, to
66% in 1995 (Chart 7). In contrast, the contribution from manufacturing firms fell by 4pp over the
same period, to 22%. Robson (1998) finds that self-employment rates across UK regions are
highest in those regions in which ‘a relatively high proportion of GDP is accounted for by certain
industries in which the [financial] barriers to self-employment tend to be relatively low.’
Consequently, the transition to a predominantly service orientated economy appears to have opened
up new opportunities for entrepreneurs.
b) Financial deregulation
The financial hurdles were further eroded by the liberalisation of banking rules in the 1980s
and the subsequent appreciation of house prices (Chart 8). Robson (1998) argues that the major
source of loan collateral for start-ups in the United Kingdom is the equity provided by owner
occupied housing. Thus, rising house prices enable liquidity constrained, nascent entrepreneurs to
start a business. The annual, nominal7 rate of house price inflation was positive throughout the
1980s, averaging 12.3%, according to the Nationwide index. Indeed, the average UK house price

10

rose 170% between 1980 and 1989. And the home-ownership rate, propelled by the sale of council
houses following the 1980 Housing Act and introduction of the Right-to-Buy scheme, rose from
57.6% in 1981 to 65.2% in 1989.8 Black et al. (1996), for example, found that a 10% rise in the
value of unreleased net housing equity increases the number of new firm VAT registrations by
some 5%. Cowling and Mitchell (1997) estimate that a 10% rise in housing wealth increases the
proportion of the workforce in self-employment by 3%. Over the 1980s, the number of selfemployed workers rose by 1,327,000, or 60.2%.
c) Government policies
Financial liberalisation supported the growth in self-employment, but other government
policies were introduced during the 1980s that were specifically aimed at encouraging more
workers to become self-employed. Local Enterprise Agencies (LEAs), for example, were created
in 1978, to encourage the formation and growth of small firms by providing grants, advice and
training to unemployed workers. The agencies originated as a partnership response from business
and local councils to high levels of unemployment and the demise of large sections of
manufacturing, particularly in the industrial Midlands and the North, but their work continues
today across the United Kingdom. These were followed in 1981 by the Loan Guarantee Scheme
(LGS), through which the government acts as the guarantor on private sector loans to small and
‘young’ businesses. Loans are made to firms or individuals unable to obtain conventional finance
because of a lack of track record or security. The guarantee generally covers 70% of the
outstanding loan. This rises to 85% for established businesses trading for two years or more. Loans
can be for amounts between £5,000 and £100,000 (£250,000 for established businesses) and over a
period of two to ten years. Data are not available prior to 1995, but in the decade since, 46,531

loans were granted worth about £2 billion. Of these, about a third went to start-ups. Table 5 shows
that of the period total, around a third of firms (14,700) defaulted on their loan.
The Enterprise Allowance Scheme (EAS) ran from 1983 to 1991, paying self-employed
workers a supplementary weekly income (of around £40 a week) for up to 12 months. In theory,
this scheme compensated workers for a loss of unemployment benefit. Only the very short-term
unemployed, those unemployed for less than 13 weeks (although this was later reduced), were
excluded from the programme.

There were criticisms that the EAS potentially created

displacement (occurring when subsidised businesses took output and employment from nonsubsidised firms) and ‘deadweight loss’ effects (arising when a subsidy was paid to a firm that
would have been set up anyway in the absence of the scheme). Nevertheless, Campbell and Daly
(1992) estimate that following implementation, one in eight of those that became self-employed
during the late 1980s were supported into employment through this scheme. It is apparent from
Table 3 that in the twelve months following the scheme’s introduction self-employment rose by
266k, the largest recorded annual increase of the past 40 years.
d) Tax system
The decision to become, and remain, self-employed can also be affected by the tax system.
The methods for computing tax between employees and self-employed workers vary significantly
in the United Kingdom (see Freedman (2001) for a comprehensive discussion). Freedman (2001)
argues that attempts to evade the payment of tax in the construction sector influenced movements
in self-employment numbers over the late 1980s and 1990s. Under the original rules of the
Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), which is the Inland Revenue’s taxation system for the
construction industry, employers had an incentive to treat employees as self-employed workers in
order to avoid paying National Insurance Contributions, nor provide benefits, training or observe

12

employment protection laws.

The Inland Revenue took steps to revise the CIS in 1995 by

introducing mandatory registration cards for all subcontractors. Without the card, a subcontractor
is treated as an employee. With the card, the subcontractor is paid under deduction of tax and
treated as self-employed. Freedman records that 700,000 construction industry workers were
treated as self-employed in 1986. But between 1995 and 1997, 200,000 construction workers
reclassified themselves as employees, which can more than explain the reduction in selfemployment over the period (-100k). Table 6 records a 12pp fall in the construction sector selfemployment rate between 1995 and 2000 using LFS data, while most other sectors (the exception
being agriculture) recorded more modest declines, or small increases. The years 2000-2005 show
an increase in the self-employment share of construction workers. Table 7 shows the changes in
the industry distribution of the self-employed. The declining importance of construction in terms
of its share from 1995-2000 is striking, as is its increased importance subsequently, alongside
increases in Real Estate, Renting and Business Activities.
Changes in the tax system can also have large, and sometimes unexpected, ramifications for
the numbers of workers who choose to become self-employed. For instance, the UK government
abolished corporation tax on the first £10,000 of company profits in April 2002, and also allowed
directors of small companies to save income tax by taking their salaries as profits. This may have
stimulated some already self-employed workers to incorporate in order to avoid paying income tax
and national insurance contributions. But the changes probably also contributed to an increase in
the number of employees who became self-employed; the number of self-employed workers
increased by 10.1% between 2002Q1 and 2003Q4, according to the LFS. This increase is reflected
in a rise in the proportion of self-employed workers who had been employees a year earlier. Table
8 shows that the flows from employment into self-employment, while volatile, peaked in 2002-

13

2003.

The largest increase in self-employment (around half) during 2002-2003 came in the

Banking, Finance and Insurance sectors and was dominated by the 35-49 age group, although there
were also large increases in the 50-64/59 and 65/60 and over age groups. The rise seems consistent
with media stories about City job losses leading to people moving into self-employment (Lindsay
and Macaulay (2004)). In any case, the government re-considered its position following the
increase in incorporations and decided to tax distributed profits at 19% in 2004, thus reducing the
incentives for workers to turn to self-employment. Following this tax change, the flows from
employment into self-employment declined.
e) Price of investment goods
An additional exogenous stimulus to self-employment growth over the past few decades has
been a steady decline in the price of investment goods, particularly information, communication
and technology (ICT) products, relative to other goods (Chart 9). Such a decline can be explained
by an increase in technological progress in the development of these goods in comparison with
other sectors (Bakhshi & Thompson (2002)).

These price falls will have increased the relative

rates of return from self-employment, making independence more attractive (Blau, 1987 and Acs et
al., 1994).
Over the past couple of years there has been a substantial growth in the numbers of self
employed as well as in the self-employment rate The data below are taken from Table 3 of Labour
Market Statistics First Release, ONS April 2007. Total employment also includes small numbers
of unpaid family workers and those on Government schemes. The numbers of self-employed over
the period Dec-Feb 2005-2007 increased by 187,000, representing 64.0% of the total growth of
employment of 292,000 over the period.9 Moreover, only 37.6% of the additional employee jobs

quarter, December 2006 – February 2007, the number of employees fell by 68,000 while the
number of self-employed grew by 30,000. What explains this increase?

Early analysis of LFS data for the period 2004-2006 suggests little if any change in the
distribution of the self-employed by industry (Table 7) or by occupation or region.10 However,
there have been increases in the proportion of the self-employed that are a) immigrants, b) females.
At the same time there have been increases in the age of the self-employed and a decline in the

available from the ONS to do this matching for those of working age. There is little evidence of
much change in the transition rates over time. The most pronounced change has been a small
increase in the flow into self-employment from inactivity.
Chart 11 shows that self-employment rates have remained roughly constant over time at all
ages except for those above retirement age, which continues to rise for both men and women. As a
result the average age of the self-employed continues to rise. Below we present the (weighted) age,

Data are available in the Spring quarter of each year of the LFS from the variables oycirc
and oystat, which report the individual's labour market status and whether they were self-employed
or not a year earlier and is not restricted to those of working age. These enable us to calculate
transition probabilities for all ages (as in Table 8 and charts 4, 5 and 6). Reported below is labour
market status in year t-1 for those who were self-employed in year t. It is apparent that the outflow
rate from self-employment has slowed while the inflow rate from OLF has increased alongside a
decline in the inflow rate from being an employee.

The biggest change is the increase in the proportion working in Other Community, Social and
Personal.
At this time it is by no means obvious why the self-employment rate has increased. In part
it is because of increased immigration alongside moves to self-employment from those who had
previously been OLF. It does not appear that the most recent increase in self-employment has been
the result of changes in regulation, tax changes or changes in the minimum wage (Blanchflower et
al. 2007a, 2007b). However, we do believe that rising house prices are a significant explanatory
factor through their ability to ease credit constraints (see below).

17

2. Self-employment and Earnings
We make use of data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and the Survey of Personal
Incomes (SPI) conducted by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to compare the earnings of the
self-employed with those of employees, as the LFS does not ask respondents who classify
themselves as being self-employed about their labour income(s). The earnings distributions for the
self-employed and employees are very different. Median incomes are lower for the self-employed
than for employees, but the self-employed distribution has a longer right hand tail, so somebody
90% up the self-employment earnings distribution has higher earnings than an employee at the 90th
percentile of the wage and salary distribution. For example, the median gross weekly income from
self-employment in 2005 was £249 (£12,948 annually), according to the FRS. This compares with
£333 per week (£17,316 annually) for employees (Chart 12a).

The lower weekly income for self-

employed workers partly reflects the fact that 6.9% of self-employed workers actually earned
nothing, or lost money as a result of their occupation in 2005. Excluding these workers causes the
median gross weekly wage rate to rise to £276 (a sixth less than employed workers).
The relative success of those at the top end of the self-employed income distribution is
particularly striking if one looks at means rather than medians; the pay levels of the two groups are
almost identical on this measure (Chart 12b). This indicates that there are significant returns
available for successful entrepreneurs. But the fact that more than 80% of self-employed workers
earn less than employees ‘is noteworthy considering the age distribution of the self-employed is
older than that of employees (Weir, 2003)’.
HMRC collects data on individuals’ incomes, principally for tax modelling and forecasting
purposes. A sample of this data is made available in the form of the SPI, which provides the most
comprehensive and accurate official source of data on personal incomes in the UK. The dataset

18

contains a range of variables related to taxable personal incomes arising from employment, selfemployment, pensions, benefits, property, savings and investments and other income sources. Also
included are variables related to allowances, deductions and tax relief that people may be due. A
limitation of the data, however, is that a continuous time series is only available from 1999/00. The
SPI is carried out annually.11 Data are collected from three HMRC operational IT systems, which
are as follows:
1. COP: this covers all employees and occupational or personal pension recipients
with a PAYE record;
2. CESA: this covers the self assessment (SA) population; those with self-employment,
rent or untaxed investment income, directors and other people with complex tax affairs or high
incomes. Some people have both a COP and CESA record.
3. Claims: this covers people without COP or CESA records who have had too much
tax deducted at source and claim repayment.
HMRC has kindly supplied data to us on employee and self-employee income distributions
from the SPI, for the financial years 1999/00 to 2003/4. The distributions are banded, with lower
limit thresholds ranging from zero (for self-employees) to £100,000+. The data presented below
for 2003/4 indicate that 4.0 million individuals earned some income from self-employment – while
another half a million self-employed reported no positive income. This compares with 3.63 million
self-reported self-employed in the LFS for the same period. The difference between the two
numbers reflects the fact that some individuals have more than one job. Total earnings from selfemployment are recorded at £67,750 million in 2003/4, compared with £446,000 million for

11

The approximate sample sizes for recent survey years are as follows: 1999/2000, n=150,000; 2000/2001, n=200,000;
2001/2002, n=300,000; 2002/2003, n=400,000; 2003/2004, n=400,000.

earnings.

There is evidence then, that on average, the self-employed are paid less than employees.
Hamilton (2000) finds similar evidence in the US and argues that this arises in part because of the
non-pecuniary benefits of “being your own boss” (2000, p.628). Similarly, Taylor (1996), using
data for the UK from the British Household Panel Study for the Autumn of 1991, found that the
self-employed had lower hourly earnings than employees (1996, Appendix).12 Weir (2003), using
data from the 2001/2 FRS, found that the first four fifths of self-employed workers in the income
distribution earn less than the first four-fifths of employees, but the highest one fifth earned more
than employees. Updating this analysis indicates little change in the distribution over the past
decade. Charts 13a & 13b provide income distributions for 2003/4 and 1994/5 respectively using

12

£8.20 and £9.71 per hour respectively (Taylor, 1996).

20

data from the Family Resources Surveys. These results are broadly supported by data from HMRC
with data for 2003/4 and 1999/00 from the SPI (Charts 14a & 14b), although the proportion of selfemployed workers earning more than employees is slightly smaller.
One problem with these earnings measures will be the extent to which the self-employed
under-report their income because they inappropriately charge some of their income to expenses.
There is also the possibility that work is paid for 'under the table' – self-employment allows more
opportunities to work in the black economy.13 It is very difficult to obtain quantitative estimates
for such illegal activities. Lyssiotou et al (2004) estimate the size of the black economy by
estimating the extent to which self-employment income is underreported in the UK, using data
from the 1993 Family Expenditure Survey. The idea is to use data on consumption to obtain an idea
of the degree of under-reporting. Their empirical analysis suggests that the size of the selfemployment related black economy in the UK amounts to 10.6% of GDP. They also found that
households with a head in a blue collar self-employment occupation under-report more than
households with a head in a white collar self-employment occupation.
We can appreciate the significant returns available to the most successful entrepreneurs
based in Britain by looking at the Sunday Times Rich List. The list, which is compiled annually,
records estimates of the minimum identifiable wealth of Britain’s 1,000 richest people or
families.14 The results measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or
significant shares in publicly quoted companies. Personal bank accounts are excluded – as access
in not permitted. The most recent valuations available at the time of writing were carried out at the

13

Indeed, Fairlie (2002) finds that a specific group of people who worked in the black economy – drug dealers – were
more likely to be self-employed in the real economy later, presumably because they understood risk taking.

14

The actual size of their fortunes may be much larger than the figures estimated by the Sunday Times.

21

beginning of January 2007.15 The results show that the richest entrepreneur in Britain (and 7th in
the world) was Lakshmi Mittal, worth £19,250 million.

The 1,000th richest person had an

estimated personal fortune of £70 million. Clearly the returns for the most successful self-employed
far exceed the highest paid employees – although some on the list have made a significant
proportion of their wealth as city traders. The wealthiest trader in the 2007 list, which we might
take to be the wealthiest employee in Britain, was Michael Sherwood, worth an estimated £225
million (319th).
Of those in the 2007 list, 1,028 were men and just 92 were women – the number is higher
than 1,000 because some entries are couples or families. The eldest entrant was aged 94, while the
youngest was 25. There are a total of 774 self-made millionaires, while the rest inherited their
wealth. A fifth of the most wealthy made their fortunes in land and property. The breakdown by
industry corresponds closely with our previous analysis of the LFS.

The average age of the top 15 wealthiest entrants in 2007 was 58. Of those that are self-made
billionaires, rather than having inherited their fortunes (as is the case for the Duke of Westminster,
Charlene and Michel de Carvalho, and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing), six have a degree-level
education and six do not. None of the British born entrants in the top 15 has a degree. We could
only find an estimated income figure for Lakshmi Mittal, which was estimated to be £413 million
in 2007. But are these characteristics the exception or the rule?

23

3. Who are the self-employed?
Thus far we have explained factors that may exogenously affect individuals’ decisions to
become self-employed.

But what if some workers are more pre-disposed to becoming self-

employed than others? It is appropriate at this point to compare the characteristics of the selfemployed with those of employees. We do so by examining weighted means from the UK Labour
Force Surveys.
1. Age
In the LFS, self-employed workers (aged 16+) were on average six years older than their
employed counterparts in 2006 (45.8 vs. 39.3 respectively). Chart 15 illustrates that the age
distribution of the self-employed is skewed to the right, compared with that for employees. It
seems plausible that younger workers are less likely to have the necessary human capital
(experience) to become self-employed. Younger individuals are probably also more likely to be
credit constrained, limiting a larger proportion of them from starting a new business. At the other
end of the distribution, older workers face retirement, but that is not an issue for the self-employed.
Indeed, many retirees (either at state pension age or earlier) may take advantage of the opportunity
self-employment brings to remain in the workplace, providing their skills on their own terms. It is
probably also fair to say that there is an element of risk in becoming self-employed, and this risk
can be minimised if workers have previously ensured financial stability (e.g. mortgage paid off) by
working for others.
2. Gender, marital status and children
The split between male and female employees is roughly equal (56.6% male). However,
the micro-data suggest that the self-employed are predominantly male (80.1% in 2006). This
probably reflects the fact that self-employment is more common in industries not usually associated
with high levels of female employment, such as construction (see below).

It may also be a by-

product of the fact that a much higher proportion of women are part time workers.

The self-employed have more dependent children in their family under the age of 19 (.79 children)
than is the case of employees (.71).16 This is consistent with the findings of Broussard et al (2003)
for the US.
3. Industry & Occupation
The self-employed are more likely to work in occupations that are human-capital and labour
intensive, such as construction, financial activities or agriculture. Chart 16 shows that nearly a
quarter of self-employed individuals worked in the construction industry in 2006, compared with
just 6% of employees. A further 20% worked in finance, real estate and business activities and
almost all agricultural employees - though few in total - were self-employed. In general, we would
think that service sector industries are more suited to self-employment as there will typically be
lower start-up costs, reducing barriers to entry; although a lack of human capital or qualifications to
signal ability (certainly for business activities, such as consultancy) may act as impediments.
4. Education
Chart 17 shows that about a fifth of both employees and self-employed workers had a
degree in 2006. Indeed, the distributions of the two sets of workers are very similar in general.
The one major difference is the higher proportion of the self-employed with Apprenticeship and
craft qualifications.

16

In sweep 13 of the British Household Panel Study of 2003/4 the (weighted) self-employed also had more children
than employees (.71 and .61 respectively), which includes natural children, adopted children and step children, under
the age of 16.

This suggests that the decision to become self-employed is not related to educational attainment,
although, as we noted above, it seems to be more related to age and experience. This is quite
different from the US where self-employment rates are particularly high among those with higher
degrees, especially MBAs (see Blanchflower and Wainwright, 2005).

We provide more

assessment of the differences in the characteristics of the self-employed between the US and the
UK below.
5. Co-workers
The weighted LFS micro-data for 2004-2006 show that three-quarters of the self-employed
work alone or in a partnership.

This would seem intuitive for business activities and consultancy, where specialist individuals may
be employed by larger firms, or agriculture, where a lone individual can use technology to tend
many activities. The distribution by industry for those with and without employees is as below.
The main difference is that the self-employed tend to be sole contractors in construction and have
employees in distribution.

When the self-employed do employ others, more than 90% have fewer than 20 employees. This is
in stark contrast to the employed, where two-thirds work in firms employing 25 or more workers.
Interestingly, the proportion of the self-employed with employees has shown a steady decline over
time, corroborating the trend in the VAT registrations data presented earlier.

The fact that most self-employed firms are small (in terms of employment) is suggestive of a
degree of flexibility.
6. Hours
The self-employed tend to work longer hours than employees.

On average, the self-

employed worked 40 hours per week in 2006, compared with only 34 hours for employees (Chart
18). However, the self-employed are only marginally less likely than employees to say that they
are part-timers. For example, the latest figures available at the time of writing are for December
2006-February 2007 and show that 25.7% of employees were part-time compared with 23.6% of

27

the self-employed.

Moreover, if the self-employed report that they are part-time they actually

work fewer usual hours than employees (17.3 and 18.1 per week respectively) whereas the reverse
is the case for those who report being full-timers (46.3 and 39.3 hours respectively).
7. Region
There is considerable variation by region in self-employment rates. In 2006, using region
of work to define location, self-employment rates ranged from under 8% in Tyne and Wear to just
under 19% in Outer London.

8. Immigrants
There are differences in self-employment rates by race. In 2006, in the UK, the rate for
whites was 13.0% compared with 14.6% for Asians; 8.5% for blacks and 17.1% for Chinese. The
self-employment rate of immigrants is generally higher than that of the indigenous population.
Clark and Drinkwater (2000), in their study of self-employment among ethnic minorities in
England and Wales, found that minorities who live in areas which have a high percentage of their

28

own group are less likely to be self-employed. They found that those with poor language skills
(typically more recent immigrants) had lower self-employment probabilities. Borooah and Hart
(1999) used data from the British 1991 Census to examine why so many Indians, but so few black
Caribbeans in Britain are self-employed? Over 20% of economically active Indian males, but only
8% of economically active black Caribbean males, were self-employed. The reluctance of black
men to become self-employed was, as this study suggested, because of two factors. First, they
were, relative to whites and Indians, “ethnically disinclined” to enter business – this stunted their
desire to be self-employed. Second, they did not possess, relative to whites and Indians, the
attributes that were positively related to entering business – this impaired their ability to be selfemployed. The authors estimated that 58% of the observed lack (relative to Indians) of selfemployed black males was because of ethnic disinclination and 42% was a result of attribute
disadvantage. Of course this result begs the question of why Caribbean men were disinclined to be
self-employed. Clark and Drinkwater (2000) also reported that, based on the 1991 Census of
Population, self-employment rates for blacks in England and Wales were 5.8% compared with
26.6% for Chinese and 12.3% for whites and 14.6% for non-whites.17
Column 1 of Table 9 presents data from the Labour Force Surveys of 2004-2006, which
contain data on 633,161 workers and shows that the (weighted) self-employment rate for the UK
born was 12.5% compared with 14.5% for immigrants and 12.7% overall.

The data file is

restricted to those aged 16-70. The table also suggests that there is considerable variation in selfemployment rates by the immigrants’ country of birth. Self-employment rates were highest among
those born in Romania (44%), Iran (32%), Thailand (32%), Pakistan (31%) and Turkey (27%) and

17

Using data from the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities conducted in 1993/1994 Clark and Drinkwater
(2000) found self-employment rates to be especially high, among both men and women, for Pakistanis, Indians and
African Asians.

29

lowest for those born in the Philippines (3%), Slovakia (3%) and Finland (1%). Self-employment
rates tend to be lower for more recent immigrants, in part, for the very obvious reason, that they
tend to be younger. For example, average self-employment rates and average age based on number
of years in the UK for immigrants is as follows (LFS 2004-2006)

In the second column of Table 9 we present equivalent evidence on self-employment rates
by country of birth for the United States using data for 2,552,483 workers from the Basic Monthly
files of the Current Population Survey. Here we define self-employment to include both the
unincorporated and the incorporated self-employed. In the official statistics the self-employment
rate only includes the unincorporated, although their earnings are not included in wage and salary
measures.18

We only present evidence for countries where there are matched pairs - these

exclusions are not significant. In the US, the self-employment rate of immigrants (10.1%) is
marginally less than that of the indigenous population (10.6%). The self-employment rate of the
UK born in the US (12.8%) is virtually identical to the rate in the UK as a whole (12.7%). In
contrast the self-employment rates, of those born in the US who reside in the UK, (17.6%) is higher
than in the US (10.6%). Interestingly, there is no correlation between the self employment rates
across the two countries.

9. Self-employed second jobs
The LFS data indicate that a number of individuals who are employees also work selfemployed in a second job. It turns out that this is a particularly important phenomenon in the
public sector, especially among academics and health professionals, including therapists. It is
especially high for those with higher degrees. Overall, 0.9% of employees in their main job had a
second job that was self-employed: the rate was 0.6% in the private sector and 1.5% in the public.

10. Happiness, life and job satisfaction
The self-employed are generally more satisfied with their jobs than employees
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998; Blanchflower, 2004; Green and Tsitsianis, 2006).

In an

important paper, Frey and Benz (2002) examine job satisfaction data for the UK, Germany and
Switzerland and find evidence that the self-employed are more satisfied at work than employees.
What is impressive about this paper is that the authors have panel data over a number of years on
the same individuals for both the UK (1991-1999) and Germany (1984-2000) and show that this
result remains even in the presence of people specific fixed effects. There is also some recent
evidence from Finland suggesting that the self-employed are less risk averse than employees.
Ekelund et al (2005) used data from the 1966 Northern Finnish Birth Cohort Study. Unfortunately
the measure of risk-aversion is a contemporaneous one so it is difficult to determine causality.

31

The self-employed seem to like their jobs despite the fact that their work isn’t easy. The
self-employed report that they a) work under a lot of pressure, b) find their work stressful, c) come
home from work exhausted, d) are constantly under strain, e) lose sleep over worry, f) place more
weight on work than they do on leisure, but g) are especially likely to say they have control over
their lives (Blanchflower, 2004).
The self-employed in the UK also tend to report relatively high levels of happiness and life
satisfaction (Blanchflower, 2004; Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004) and job satisfaction (Taylor,
2004; Green and Tsitsianis, 2005). To illustrate, the European Quality of Life Survey of 2003
asked respondents for their happiness, life satisfaction and job satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 10 being highest. The weighted average job satisfaction score for the UK was 8.31 for the
self-employed and 7.22 for employees. The weighted scores for life satisfaction and happiness for
the UK in 2003 were as follows:

Self-employed

Homemaker
Unemployed
Retired

Results are similar in the British Household Panel Study Sweep 13 taken primarily during 2004
with around 8% of responses in 2005. Levels of overall job satisfaction – based on a scale of 1
through seven - were 5.7 for the self-employed and 5.4 for employees. In addition the selfemployed were also less satisfied with their job security (5.0 and 5.5) and their hours (5.0 and 5.3).
Analogously the self-employed scored 5.4 and employees 5.2 when asked if they were satisfied
with their life overall, once again on a scale of 1-7. The self-employed in the UK score highly on
job satisfaction, life satisfaction and happiness.

32

11. Independence
The self-employed are especially likely to report that they value their independence. Benz
and Frey (2003) examined data on 23 countries from the International Social Survey Programme
(ISSP). They conclude that the self-employed are more satisfied with their jobs because they enjoy
‘greater autonomy and independence’. In a recent paper Hundley (2001) provides results for the
U.S. which, are similar to those of Benz and Frey. His main findings are that the self-employed are
more satisfied because their work provides more autonomy, flexibility and skill utilisation and
greater job security. In the Flash Eurobarometer Survey #160 conducted in April 2004 individuals
in EU member countries were asked "suppose you could choose between different kinds of jobs,
which one would you prefer – being an employee or self-employed?". On average 47.1% said they
would prefer to be self-employed. The individuals who said they were self-employed were asked
to give reasons why and were allowed to provide multiple answers. The major reason by far was
‘personal independence/self-fulfilment/interesting tasks’. On average across these countries, 70%
gave this answer - the next highest response was ‘better income prospects (23%). Responses by
country on independence are in column 1 below (n=9,358). Only in the US did fewer than half of
the respondents give this answer, but a further 61% in the US said ‘no need to adapt to an
environment’. These proportions by country are in the second column below

The self-employed report that they like another aspect of independence, the flexibility the
job brings and the fact that they can pick their schedule (Hytinnen and Ruuskanen, 2007).
However, the self-employed are especially likely to report being stressed (Blanchflower, 2004).
Respondents in the 14th sweep of the BHPS were asked "Do you worry about job problems after
work?" Weighted responses were as follows (%).

4. Econometric analysis of the probability of a randomly selected worker being self-employed
Given the differences that exist in the characteristics of the self-employed in terms of their
location, occupation, industry, schooling, age and gender it is appropriate to examine the extent to
which there have been changes over time, holding constant these characteristics, in a regression
framework. There is a growing body of research that has examined the probability that a randomly
sampled worker is self-employed (see Blanchflower 2000, 2004 for a summary). The main results
from this work are as follows. Self-employment is higher among men than women; among older
workers than younger workers. It is also especially high among some immigrant groups, such as
Asians. It does vary by location, being especially high in construction occupations, agriculture and
retailing. These results are updated below.
Tables 10 and 11 report the results of estimating the probability of a randomly selected
worker being self-employed. The dependent variable is set to one if self-employed, zero if an
employee; the estimation procedure is dprobit in STATA.19 Data used are from the Labour Force
Survey and in Table 10 cover the period for January 1994 - December 1996, while Table 11
performs an equivalent exercise ten years later from January 2004 - December 2006. In the first
period, the mean self-employment rate in our data was 13.7% compared with 12.7% in the
subsequent period.

Where feasible identical controls are included; the major exception is

occupation because of changes in the classification system used by the ONS in 2000. Controls in
column 1 include age and its square; a gender dummy; four race dummies and six schooling
dummies. As we move across the columns controls are added - an immigrant dummy in column 2;

19

The dprobit procedure in STATA fits maximum-likelihood probit models and is an alternative to probit. Rather than
reporting the coefficients, dprobit reports the marginal effect, that is the change in the probability for an infinitesimal
change in each independent, continuous variable and, by default, reports the discrete change in the probability for
dummy variables.

35

region of residence and industry dummies in column 3 and occupation dummies in column 4.
Interestingly, the patterns in the means isolated above are robust in the regressions.
The main findings are as follows.
1. The probability of self-employment rises non-linearly with age and reaches a maximum at age
63.8 in column 1 of Table 10 and at age 70 in column 4. In column 1 of Table 11, for the later
period the maximum was 76.7 compared with 73.0 in column 4. The positive sign on the age
variable and the negative sign on the age squared term permits the calculation of these maxima.
2. The probability of self-employment is higher for men, whites, Asians and immigrants generally,
as well as for those with A-levels or equivalent, of which over half are individuals with trade
apprenticeships (5.5%) or City & Guilds Advanced Craft Qualifications (45.3%). Probabilities are
also high in the South West and London as well as in Agriculture and Construction. Occupations
with high self-employment rates include Health Professionals; Construction Trades; Hairdressers;
Artistic and Sports Occupations and Agricultural Occupations.
3. The probability of self-employment is relatively low for blacks and those with Higher Education
qualifications, which primarily include NVQ level 4 and teaching qualifications. It is also low in
Distribution and Manufacturing and, of course, in the Public Sector. Ceteris paribus rates were
lowest in Tyne and Wear in both periods.
4. It is apparent that the patterns that emerge in Table 11 for 2004-2006 are very similar to those
for the period 1994-1996. The age maximum increased over time, as noted above, but the gender,
education and race gaps were broadly unchanged.
Table 12 presents the results of estimating a further dprobit modelling the probability that
an employee in their main job will have a second job where they are self-employed. So the
dependent variable is one if an employee in the first job and self-employed in the second zero

36

otherwise. All those reporting being self-employed in their first job are omitted. Probabilities are
higher for men, whites and rise with age reaching a maximum over the age 54 in column 3. They
are especially high in London and East Anglia. As noted earlier, self-employed second jobs are
especially important for people with higher degrees and teaching qualifications and are particularly
important in universities. If we count these individuals into the self-employment count they add
nearly a percentage point (mean=0.87%).
How do the characteristics of the self-employed in the UK compare with those in the United
States? As background, Table 13 provides details of the distribution of incorporated and
unincorporated self-employment and wage and salary employment by gender, race and whether
foreign born for the US in 2005.20 There were approximately twice as many unincorporated selfemployed than incorporated – 10 and a half million and 5 and a quarter million respectively. The
incidence of self-employment is highest in middle age and is higher among men. In comparison
with wage and salary work, minorities are under-represented in self-employment. For example,
11.5% of wage and salary workers are black compared with 6.3% of unincorporated and 3.7% of
incorporated self-employed and similarly for the foreign born. In contrast, Asians have a higher
representation in incorporated self-employment than they do in wage and salary work.
Table 14 presents econometric evidence for the United States comparable to that for the UK
in Table A.11, again for 2004-2006, using data from the Basic Monthly files of the Current
Population Survey (BMCPS) for the same years as in Table 11. The US sample size is four times
larger at over two and a half million workers. The dependent variable is defined in the same way
as in Tables 10 and 11, set to one if self-employed and zero if an employee. As in Table 9, the self-

20

Note that the unincorporated self-employment rate is actually constructed as in Table 9 as the proportion of the
unincorporated self-employed over total workers, which in 2005 was 7.4%.

37

employed includes both the incorporated and unincorporated (Blanchflower and Wainwright,
2005).
It is necessary, however, to make an adjustment in the various regressions we report
because there are repeat observations of individuals and households in the Current Population
Survey. This has the effect of biasing downwards the size of the standard errors and biasing
upwards the t-statistics, although it will leave the size of the estimated coefficients unchanged. The
intuition is that the same people are in the survey multiple times, which causes a statistical problem
as the econometric method assumes we are sampling different people. If we did not do this
adjustment this would have the effect of wrongly suggesting statistical significance when it was not
present, although practically this has little effect as the standard errors are generally so small.
To adjust for the problem of repeat observations we cluster the standard errors at the level
of the household using the cluster procedure in the econometric software program STATA. In total
there are more than half a million data points for the period 2004-2006.21 Care has also to be taken
because the individual identifiers in the BMCPS are recycled, which means that once an individual
leaves the survey that number is given to another individual as they join the sample. These
individual identifiers are recycled to individuals in the same area. Given this recycling problem we
have had to adjust the data a second time to ensure that individuals and households are identified
appropriately. We do so by creating a new identifier with the year the household first appears in
the data file appended to the end of the original identifier, which solves the problem.
The main results are as follows - where possible we draw direct comparisons with results
from the UK, for the same period 2004-2006, in Table 11.

21

The data and documentation are downloadable from the NBER website at http://www.nber.org/data/cps_basic.html.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also maintains a CPS website at http://www.bls.census.gov/cps/ with a great deal of
information about the survey and access to downloads of recent data.

38

1. The self-employment rate of men is higher than it is for women. It rises with age and reaches a
maximum of 67.1 in column 1 and 72.5 in column 4. Probabilities are higher for immigrants
holding constant characteristics, which was not true in the means.
2. Self-employment rates for blacks are lower than for whites both in the UK and the US.
3. In contrast to the UK, self-employment rates are highest for those with professional
qualifications such as an MBA and a PhD in the US.
4. Rates are highest in Montana and California and lowest in West Virginia, Delaware and the
District of Columbia.
5. As in the UK, self-employment rates are highest in Agriculture and Construction and among
Artistic and Sporting as well as Sales occupations. They are also high in the US among Personal
Care and Service Occupations.
Finally, Table 15 reports self-employment probabilities across EU member states using data
from the Eurobarometer data series. The first column covers data from 14 member countries plus
Norway for the period 1974-2002. Column 2 performs a similar exercise, but for a very recent
sweep of the Eurobarometer series, from December 2005- January 2006 and includes a larger
sample of countries, including the new East European member states. In both cases the UK is the
excluded category. The dependent variable once again is one if self-employed, zero if an employee.
The main evidence from this table is as follows.
1. There has been a declining time trend in the incidence of self-employment across member
states.
2. Self-employment rates are higher for men and for those with less schooling.
3. There is no evidence that the age squared term is significant - the probability of being selfemployed rises linearly with age in each column.

39

4. In comparison to the UK, based on column 2, self-employment rates are significantly higher in
Turkish Cyprus; the Czech Republic; East Germany; Greece; Italy; Poland; Romania and Turkey.
To summarise, self-employment probabilities in the UK rise with age, are high for men,
whites, immigrants, individuals with trade apprenticeships, workers in the South West and London
as well as in Agriculture and Construction. Occupations with high self-employment rates include
Health Professionals; Construction Trades; Hairdressers; Artistic and Sports Occupations and
Agricultural Occupations. Broadly similar patterns are found in both the US and the EU.

5. Liquidity constraints
Even though approximately one worker in eight is self-employed in the UK there appears to
remain a strong desire among employees to be self-employed. Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer
(2001) examined data from the 1997/8 International Social Survey Programme and found that
nearly half of employees in the UK expressed a desire to be self-employed. New data have
recently become available from five sweeps of the Entrepreneurship Flash Eurobarometers on the
same issue. There is consistent evidence in Table 16 from both data sources that approximately
half of all wage workers in the UK say they would prefer to be self-employed; this pattern is
repeated in other countries in the survey and is especially high in the US and Portugal.22
This raises an important puzzle. Why do so few individuals manage to translate their
preferences into action? Lack of start-up capital appears to be one likely explanation.
In work based on US micro data at the level of the individual, Evans and Leighton (1989),
and Evans and Jovanovic (1989), have argued that entrepreneurs face liquidity constraints. The
authors use the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men for 1966-1981, and the Current
Population Surveys for 1968-1987. The key test shows that, all else remaining equal, people with
22

Sample sizes in Table 16 are as follows: column 2 n=32,606; column 3 =31,868; column 4=31,604.

40

greater family assets are more likely to switch to self-employment from employment. This asset
variable enters probit equations significantly and with a quadratic form. Although Evans and his
collaborators draw the conclusion that capital and liquidity constraints bind, this claim is open to
the objection that other interpretations of their correlation are feasible.

One possibility, for

example, is that inherently acquisitive individuals both start their own businesses and forego leisure
to build up family assets. In this case, there would be a correlation between family assets and
movement into self-employment even if capital constraints did not exist. A second possibility is
that the correlation between family assets and the movement to self-employment arises because
children tend to inherit family firms. Parker (2002) provides some much needed theory on whether
banks ration enterprises.
Blanchflower and Oswald (1998), find that the probability of self-employment depends
positively upon whether the individual ever received an inheritance or gift. Burke et al (2000,
2002) replicate the findings using the same data source. Work by Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and
Rosen (1994a, 1994b), drew similar conclusions using different methods on US data. Lindh and
Ohlsson (1994) adopt the Blanchflower-Oswald procedure and provide complementary evidence
for Sweden. Bernhardt (1994), in a study for Canada, using data from the 1981 Social Change in
Canada Project also found evidence that capital constraints appear to bind. And Kidd (1993) also
reported that the availability of capital in Australia is a significant barrier to self-employment.
Taylor (2001), in an interesting paper that uses the British Household Panel Study for the
period 1994-1996, explores the impact of windfall gains on self-employment. A windfall payment
is defined as being from a personal accident claim; a redundancy payment; an annual/seasonal
bonus from employment; a win on the football pools; national lottery or other sort of gambling; or
anything else. Taylor finds that the size of the payment received has a positive, and concave,

41

impact on the probability of entering self-employment and on the performance of an existing selfemployed enterprise, once again consistent with the liquidity constraint hypothesis. Georgellis et al
(2005) extend Taylor's analysis to the later period 1994-2000. The authors find evidence of
significant capital constraints - windfalls raise the probability of transition into self-employment at
a decreasing rate.
Johansson (2000a, 2000b), in studies for Finland, used a unique data file drawn from the
Longitudinal Employment Statistics, compiled by Statistics Finland. It covers the years 1987-1995
and includes, in principle, every individual who has had a job in Finland during the period – it is
the population. A sample of just over 100,000 workers aged 18-65 was randomly selected and they
were followed from 1987-1994. Johannsson’s empirical strategy was to model the probability of
an individual entering self-employment. The main result from the study was that a higher level of
wealth significantly increased the probability that an individual made a transition from wageemployment to self-employment. Yannis and Wall (2005) find that capital constraints in Germany
based on the GSOEP are especially important for men in explaining movements into selfemployment. Moreover Holtz-Eakin and Rosen (2005), also using the GSOEP, found that German
workers faced capital constraints that are more severe than those faced by American workers.
Hurst and Lusardi (2004) have claimed that there is little evidence that lack of wealth
constrains entrepreneurship apart from at the top of the wealth distribution – above the 95th
percentile. They make this claim using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the
period 1989-1994, which contains only 7,500 observations. Very few people in their data – only
304 or 4% - actually transit into self-employment. It appears that their results are driven entirely by
measurement error and hence should be ignored. Not finding evidence for something in a poorly
specified equation tells us little or nothing about the role of capital constraints or of wealth in

42

setting up a business. Indeed, Fairlie and Krashinsky (2006) examined this issue in some detail.
They demonstrate that, using the PSID also, and bifurcating the sample into workers who enter
self-employment after job loss and those who do not reveals steadily increasing entry rates as assets
increase in both sub-samples. They argue that these two groups merit a separate analysis, because
the two groups face different incentives, and thus have different solutions to the entrepreneurial
decision. Second, they used micro-data from matched Current Population Surveys (1993-2004) to
demonstrate that housing appreciation measured at the MSA-level is a significantly positive
determinant of entry into self-employment. Their estimates indicate that a 10 percent annual
increase in housing equity increases the mean probability of entrepreneurship by roughly 20
percent and that the effect is not concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution.

Using the 1991 French Household Survey of Financial Assets, Laferrere and McEntee
(1995), examined the determinants of self-employment using data on intergenerational transfers of
wealth, education, informal human capital and a range of demographic variables. They also find
evidence of the importance played by the family in the decision to enter self-employment.
Intergenerational transfers of wealth, familial transfers of human capital and the structure of the
family were found to be determining factors in the decision to move from wage work into
entrepreneurship.
Broussard et al. (2003) found that the self-employed in the US have between .2 and .4 more
children compared to the non-self-employed. The authors argue that having more children can
increase the likelihood that an inside family member will be a good match at running the business.
One might also think that the existence of family businesses, which are particularly prevalent in

43

farming, is a further way to overcome the existence of capital constraints. Transfers of firms within
families will help to preserve the status quo and will work against the interests of blacks in
particular, who do not have as strong a history of business ownership as indigenous whites.
Analogously, Hout and Rosen (2000) found that the offspring of self-employed fathers are
more likely than others to become self-employed (see also Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000). These
studies generally find that an individual who had a self-employed parent is roughly two to three
times more likely to be self-employed than someone who did not have a self-employed parent.
More recently Fairlie and Robb (2006) have demonstrated, using data from the 1992
Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey, that more than half of all business owners had a
self-employed family member prior to starting their business.

Conditional on having a self-

employed family member, less than 50 percent of small business owners worked in that family
member's business suggesting that it is unlikely that intergenerational links in self-employment are
largely the result of the acquisition of general and specific business human capital and that instead
similarities across family members in entrepreneurial preferences may explain part of the
relationship. In contrast, estimates from regression models conditioning on business ownership
indicated that having a self-employed family member plays only a minor role in determining small
business outcomes, whereas the human capital acquired from prior work experience in a family
member's business appears to be very important for business success. Estimates from the CBO also
indicated that only 1.6 percent of all small businesses are inherited suggesting that the role of
business inheritances in determining intergenerational links in self-employment is limited at best.
Fairlie and Meyer (2000), rule out a number of explanations for the difference in the selfemployment rates of white and black males. They found that trends in demographic factors,
including the Great Migration and the racial convergence in education levels “did not have large

44

effects on the trend in the racial gap in self-employment” (p. 662). They also found that an initial
lack of business experience “cannot explain the current low levels of black self-employment.”
Further they found that “the lack of traditions in business enterprise among blacks that resulted
from slavery cannot explain a substantial part of the current racial gap in self-employment” (p.
664). Fairlie (1999) and Wainwright (2000) have shown that a considerable part of the explanation
of the differences between the African American and white self-employment rate can be attributed
to discrimination. Bates (1989) finds strong supporting evidence that racial differences in levels of
financial capital have significant effects upon racial patterns in business failure rates. Fairlie
(1999) also found that the black exit rate from self-employment is twice as high as that of whites.
Using the same 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey, Fairlie and Robb
(2005) examined why African-American owned businesses lag substantially behind white-owned
businesses in sales, profits, employment, and survival. Black business owners, they found, were
much less likely than white owners to have had a self-employed family member prior to starting
their business and are less likely to have worked in that family member's business. They found
further that the lack of prior work experience in a family business among black business owners,
perhaps by limiting their acquisition of general and specific business human capital, negatively
affects black business outcomes
Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman (2003) examined the availability of credit to
minority and female-owned small businesses using data from the 1993 and 1998 National Surveys
of Small Business Finances conducted by the Reserve Board of Governors. They demonstrated
that loan denial probabilities for African-American owned firms are approximately double those for
comparable white-owned firms. Even when African-Americans were able to obtain loans they
have to pay higher interest rates. Comparable, but smaller effects are found for Hispanics. These

45

differences were not explained by differences in creditworthiness or other observables. Such
differences disappeared when the use of credit cards was examined, where the banks were unaware
of the race of the applicant. The authors found that firms owned by minorities are discriminated
against in the credit market. Similar results were found by Cavalluzzo, Cavalluzzo and Wolken
(2002).
A recent study published by the US Chamber of Commerce (2005) confirms the findings in
Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman (2003). The survey was conducted in March and April
2005 and detailed the financing problems experienced by small business owners, 95% of whom
had less than 100 employees: 1,080 business owners were interviewed and reported that minority
businesses rely heavily on credit cards to fund their businesses, often do not apply for credit, even
though they need it, for fear of being denied and were especially likely to need working capital. In
particular they report that the availability of credit is their top problem, exactly as reported by
Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman (2003).

The biggest difference in responses between

minorities and Caucasian men and women was availability of credit: 19% of Caucasian males
report credit as their top problem compared with 54% for minority males – a 35 percentage point
difference. There was a 15 percentage point difference for women. In no other category is there
more than a 10 percentage point difference for men or women.
It is appropriate to examine some new empirical evidence which appears to support the
proposition that liquidity constraints bind on small businesses. First we examine the impact of
inheritances and gifts and then the role of rising house prices and find they both appear to generate
more self-employment.
Table 17 uses new evidence from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) on the
incidence of self-employment among workers in their mid forties. The NCDS is a birth cohort

46

study covering every individual born in the week 3rd-9th March 1958. Blanchflower and Oswald
(1998) examined the impact of inheritances and gifts on the probability of an individual being selfemployed on sweeps four and five conducted at ages twenty-three and thirty-three respectively. In
that paper it was found that an exogenous shock or windfall in the form of an inheritance or gift received at any point from birth to age twenty three - and expressed in 1981 pounds raised the
probability of self-employment. New data have recently become available on the seventh sweep of
the NCDS conducted in 2004/2005 when the respondents were aged 46 or 47. It turns out that the
higher the value of an inheritance or gift the higher is the probability of self-employment not only
at ages twenty-three and thirty-three but also, more than twenty years later, at age 46/47. This
result remains even when controlling for education and the social class of the respondent's mother's
husband (usually the father) when the respondent was aged eleven. Having a father who was selfemployed - even when the respondent was young, at age 11 - raises the probability of the
respondent being self-employed thirty-five years later. It turns out, also that a Copying Design test
score conducted at age eleven is a significant predictor of whether or not the respondent is selfemployed thirty-five years later. Other controls including Verbal and Non-Verbal IQ, Math and
Reading test scores at ages 7, 11 and 16 were everywhere insignificant. Results are the same in
column 4 when the dependent variable is set to zero not only for employees, but also for the
unemployed and those who are out of the labour force (OLF). Lack of start-up capital is a likely
explanation why individual’s ambitions to be self-employed do not meet fruition. Blanchflower
and Oswald (1998) also found that when directly questioned in interview surveys, potential
entrepreneurs say that raising capital is their principal problem.
Another type of windfall is an increase in house prices, which may help home owners to
overcome capital constraints by releasing home equity. Rising house prices, for example, enable

47

liquidity constrained nascent entrepreneurs to start a business, or even to enable it to survive.
Black et al (1996), for example, found that a 10% rise in the value of housing equity increased the
number of new firm VAT registrations in the UK by some 5%. Taylor (2004) found that an
increase in house prices increased the probability of self-employment entry.

Chart 8 above

suggested that, at the national level, changes in self-employment and nominal house price inflation
moved reasonably closely together. The self-employment rate ticked up in 2005 as house prices
rose and fell at the end of the 1980s as house prices fell.
We explore this relationship more closely in Table A.18, where we regress the log of the
self-employment rate, defined by region and year, on the (log) house price and the log of the
regional unemployment rate, as well as a full set of year dummies and a lagged dependent variable.
The year dummies can be thought of as proxying inflation, so the house price variable should be
thought of as being in real terms. The year dummies will also capture any time-variant, yearspecific factors that affect all regions symmetrically – such as changes in legislation.
In each of the columns 1-4, the house price variable enters significantly, with or without a
lagged dependent variable or with region fixed effects. The unemployment rate is significant in
columns 1 and 3 (although of opposite sign), but not in the presence of the lagged dependent
variable. The unemployment rate does become significant in column 5, however, where the year
dummies are replaced with an (insignificant) price deflator, but this equation fails to account for the
effects of legislative changes. The house price elasticity of our preferred equation (column 4)
means that a doubling of house prices leads to an increase in the self-employment rate of 9.5%, so
the effect isn’t small. We take this as evidence of liquidity constraints being eased for nascent
entrepreneurs as house prices rise, entirely consistent with the findings of Black et al. (1996) for the
period 1966-1990, Cowling and Mitchell (1997) for the period 1972-1992, and Taylor (2004) for

48

the period 1970-2001. Henley (2005) also shows the importance of housing wealth for the selfemployed in job creation. It is also consistent with Fairlie and Krashinsky's (2006) findings for the
US on the positive relationship between housing appreciation and the prevalence of
entrepreneurship.
Between 2005Q1 and 2007Q1 approximately 70% of the growth in total UK employment
has been from self-employment (217k out of 305k), raising the self-employment rate from 12.6
percentage points to 13.2 percentage points, which is an increase of 4.9%. Over the same period
aggregate UK house prices have appreciated by 14.7%. Solving out the long run elasticity of the
self-employment rate wrt to (log) house prices from column 4 of Table A.18, gives +0.17123:
ln self-employment ratet = .4440 ln self-employment ratet-1 + .0952 ln house pricest
To give an indication of how to interpret the size of this elasticity of 0.171, such a number
means that if house prices double the associated long-run impact is to increase the self-employment
rate by approximately a sixth. This elasticity therefore suggests that rising house prices can
potentially explain approximately half (14.7 * .171 = 2.5%) of the observed 4.9% increase in the
UK self-employment rate between 2005 and 2007. Liquidity constraints continue to bind for
small-businesses in the UK.

6. Discussion and conclusions
Self-employment rose sharply in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, encouraged by
focussed government intervention and supported by financial liberalisation. The period was also
characterised by sustained and rapid economic growth. But did greater self-employment cause
heightened growth?

23

.0952/(1-.4440)

49

Greater numbers of self-employed workers in an economy should, in theory, increase labour
market flexibility in response to demand shocks because there is no binding wage contract on the
number of hours worked. In turn, Millard (2000) argues that this should lead to greater output and
consumption and lower unemployment.

There is no empirical evidence to support such a

theoretical proposition. As we noted above, self-employment appears to be uncorrelated with
unemployment, although transitions between employees and self-employment are negatively
correlated with unemployment, while transitions from unemployment to self-employment are
positively correlated. In aggregate these two effects roughly cancel each other out. What about
any relationship with output?
Evidence from a series of GDP growth equations for twenty-three countries over the period
1966-1996 presented in Blanchflower (2000) suggested that a higher self-employment rate does not
increase the real growth rate of the economy; in fact there was even some evidence to the
contrary.24 We repeat this analysis here for a longer time period and more countries. Table 19
examines the relationship between the growth in real GDP and changes in the self-employment
rate, using time series data on the 30 OECD countries for the period 1967-2005 (the additional
seven countries are Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland).
As in Blanchflower (2000), the regressions should be thought of as a Cobb-Douglas production
function, where the change in the numbers of employees over the previous period is included to
distinguish the labour input. Capital is assumed to grow linearly and as the model is estimated in
changes the effect of capital will be in the constant. Also included in the regressions are a set of
country dummies plus a lagged dependent variable. The columns in Table 19 experiment with

24

The twenty-three countries were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Eire, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK
and the USA

50

different measures of self-employment. Columns 1 and 2 define self-employment as the number of
self-employed as a percentage of total employment. Columns 3 and 4 define self-employment as
the number of non-agricultural self-employed as a percentage of total non-agricultural
employment.25 These results presume a particular direction of causation, from self-employment to
growth and not the reverse. Columns 1 and 3 include the change in the self-employment rate and a
lagged GDP term. Columns 2 and 4 add the change in the number of employees. In no case is the
change in the self-employment rate significant: experimenting with longer lags produced similar
results. The results confirm Blanchflower’s (2000) earlier findings, but for a richer data set – we
find no evidence that changes in self-employment are correlated with changes in real GDP.
Another measure of economic benefit could be greater happiness.

Table 20 presents

evidence on life satisfaction using data from the Eurobarometer trend file of 1970-2002 for 16
European countries in column 1 and for the UK in column 2. The final column uses data from the
most recently available (14th) sweep of the British Household Panel Study of 2004/5. In all three
columns the self-employed have significantly higher life satisfaction than do employees. So can a
higher self-employment rate lead to greater aggregate happiness? The results are not supportive.
We substituted mean life satisfaction scores on a four point scale taken from the World Database of
Happiness for 1976-2006 for GDP growth and repeated our previous analysis. The question asked
was "How satisfied are you with the life you lead? – very satisfied; fairly satisfied; not very
satisfied; not at all satisfied, where very is coded as 4 down through not at all which is coded as 1.
We include GDP growth as an explanatory variable, along with inflation and the unemployment
rate and a complete set of country and year dummies.26 Self-employment fails to provide any

25

A split excluding non-agricultural data is not available for Switzerland.

26

The results are as follows, with the dependent variable being the mean life satisfaction score in year t.

51

incremental information in explaining happiness when these other variables are included. We find
evidence that both unemployment and inflation lower happiness, although the effect is greater for
unemployment than it is for inflation, as found by Di Tella et al (2001) and Wolfers (2003). The
GDP term, which they did not include, enters significantly positive. It remains uncertain why selfemployment enters positively into a micro-level happiness equation, but not into a macro-level
equation.
These results, of course, do not mean that higher self-employment is a bad thing. A very
high proportion of individuals across a number of surveys express the desire to become selfemployed. We certainly find no evidence that more self-employment is bad for the economy. The
self-employed seem to especially value their independence. Many governments around the world
believe that it is appropriate to try and make their economies more entrepreneurial, but that need
not necessarily imply a higher self-employment rate.

And it also means that a higher self-

employment rate cannot be expected to translate directly into greater economic success. A lower
self-employment rate could conceivably be better. Can we imagine a society consisting almost
exclusively of wage and salary workers? It would seem unlikely that a self-employment rate
around zero would be optimal.

Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing what number

governments should be aiming for. Market forces need to prevail and Blanchflower’s (2004)
conclusion stands; more may not be better. Let the market rip.

The probability of being self-employed in the United Kingdom is higher for men and rises
non-linearly with age. Those with craft qualifications, including trade apprenticeships, are more
likely to be self-employed, and rates are higher for those working in the construction or retailing
industries. Immigrants are more likely to be self-employed, but there is considerable variation by
country of birth. Probabilities are also high in the South West and London as well as in Agriculture
and Construction. Occupations with high self-employment rates include Health Professionals;
Construction Trades; Hairdressers; Artistic and Sports Occupations and Agricultural Occupations.
In the US, the probabilities are higher the more educated a person is, while the opposite is
true in Europe. Financial windfalls or housing capital gains are important explanatory variables for
self-employment, through their ability to mitigate liquidity constraints. House price increases
appear to be associated with increases in the self-employment rate.
Most self-employed individuals in the UK work alone or in a partnership and do not have
any employees. They typically work longer hours than their employed counterparts, but generally
earn less. There is, however, no evidence that in aggregate increases in self-employment affect
growth in GDP, nor happiness, positively. At the very top end the successful entrepreneur earns
considerably more than most wage and salary earners. The entrepreneur has a unique skill – he or
she has created a job for him or herself and possibly even a job for others. The entrepreneur is an
important engine for growth in the economy.
