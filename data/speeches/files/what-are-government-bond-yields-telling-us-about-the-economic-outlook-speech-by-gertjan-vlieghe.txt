1. Introduction and summary
Long term interest rates have risen significantly over the past year. The yield on 10-year UK government
bonds has risen by 75bp (0.75 percentage points) since last summer. Of that increase, 65bp took place just
since the start of this year.
These moves have not just taken place in the UK. The yield on 10-year US government bonds has risen by
110bp since last summer, of which 70bp since the start of this year.
At the same time, there have been reported concerns about high levels of government debt, as well as rising
inflationary risks.
Are bond markets sending ominous warning signs, or just reflecting an improved economic outlook?
Almost entirely the latter, I will argue. And the more significant change in the inflation outlook has been in the
US, where ‚Äì relative to the UK ‚Äì inflation expectations rose from more depressed levels; there has been a
change in the central banks‚Äô inflation objective; and fiscal stimulus has been larger.
I will show that while market inflation compensation measures have increased substantially in the past year,
particularly in the US, the increase in large part reflects the unwind of recent weakness. While a temporary
rise in inflation is expected as part of the recovery from the Covid recession, the medium term outlook
remains consistent with US and UK central bank inflation targets. I will show that expectations from surveys
of professional forecasters remain well anchored at target, and that there are no signs of significant
increases in perceived tail risks of higher inflation, either from surveys or from inflation options.
I will also reflect on the impact that QE has had on government bond yields over the past year, and I will
discuss the interaction between QE and the interest cost on government borrowing.
Lastly, I will discuss the economic outlook and the implication for monetary policy. Monetary policy will focus
on the medium-term outlook for inflation rather than transient factors. What will ultimately tell to what extent
inflation pressures need a monetary policy response is the passage of time. I suspect that upward
medium-term inflation pressure will only emerge once economic slack has been fully eroded. Despite an
improved economic outlook and a likely temporary rise in inflation in the near term, a major challenge for the
economy remains to integrate the large numbers of currently furloughed workers smoothly back into the
labour market. Only once the furlough scheme has ended will we have a better idea of how much persistent
slack there is in the labour market.

2. Analysing recent changes in bond yields
To gain a better understanding of the moves in government bond yields, I will decompose them into various
components. I will focus on the moves since August of last year (which marked the low point in 10y yields),
and will briefly discuss the large swings in the early Covid crisis months of March and April 2020.

First, I will decompose nominal yields into different forward curve segments. Intuitively, you can think of any
long term rate, say the 10y rate, as consisting of a rate that applies between now and year 5, called the
5 year spot rate, and the rate that applies between year 5 and year 10, called the 5 year rate 5 years
forward, usually abbreviated as the 5y5y rate. The 10y rate, which is the annual rate applying for each year
over the next 10 years, is simply the average of the 5y rate and the 5y5y rate.1,2
Chart 1 shows that the rise in long-term yields has been driven relatively more by the 5y5y rate than by the
5y rate. While the 5y5y rose by 105bps, the 5y rate increased by just under 50bps. Since the 10y is the
average of the two, 70% of the increase in the 10y since August of last year is due to rates that apply to the
second half of the next 10y horizon.

What happened is that, at the depth of the Covid crisis last year, not only were short-term rate expectations
very low (and included expectations of negative policy rates at some stage), but forward rates far into the
future were very low as well. With high uncertainty and low inflation expectations, investors were willing to
pay very high prices for safe nominal assets ‚Äì or tolerate very low expected returns, which is the same thing.
When vaccines were shown to be effective late last year, and started to be rolled out this year, the outlook
for the economy improved significantly. While longer term interest rates started rising last summer with the
initial improvement in the economy, most of the increase happened earlier this year, after the successful
To avoid constantly referring to spot and forward rates I will use the convention with ‚Äòùë∫y rate‚Äô as the spot rate for ùë∫ years (the rate that
applies from present to ùë∫ years ahead), and ‚Äòùë≠yùë∫y rate‚Äô as the ùë∫ year rate starting ùë≠ years from now.
2
Of course there is no reason to focus just on the 10y rate, or the breakdown into 5 years periods. There are three reasons for this
choice: 1) the 10y is a very important benchmark, and the 5y5y is typically the choice when we want to ‚Äúlook beyond the current cycle‚Äù,
and as such both are very liquid; 2) this significantly simplifies the analysis and largest swings were observed in the 5 to 10 year
maturities; and 3) when we further decompose this into inflation compensation and real rate components we wish to avoid the
uncertainty beyond 10 years created by the expectation of phasing out RPI (to CPI) in approximately 10 years‚Äô time.

rollout of vaccines began. The risk of short-term interest rates being stuck near the lower bound far into the
distant future receded significantly, and distant interest rate forwards therefore rose back to levels that
prevailed in early 2019. The fact that shorter term rates remain below those levels reflects expectations that
it will take some time for the MPC to raise rates to the distant forward levels, when averaging across many
different possible paths.
Next, it is useful to decompose yields into real and inflation components.
Chart 2 (left for the UK) shows the contribution from real and inflation components, at the 5y and
5y5y horizon, from different starting dates until today.3 This shows that most of the moves in 10y yields since
August last year were driven by 5y5y real rates. After the onset of the Covid pandemic, 5y5y real rates had
fallen almost as low as 5y real rates. Again, the significant uncertainty at the time led to investors being
willing to pay a high price for safe assets, i.e. tolerate a very low expected return, even at longer horizons.

measures from inflation swaps. UK data and calculation details available here.

As uncertainty receded late last year and earlier this year, real 5y5y forward rates rose back to levels seen in
early 2019, while real rates at shorter horizons remained very low. Zooming out to gain a longer term
perspective, it is clear from Chart 3, which shows a longer history of real and inflation components, that real
rates in the UK, both the 5y and the more distant forwards, remain very low historically, even after the recent
increase. That is a story about longer term forces driving the neutral rate of interest lower, a topic that I have
discussed on several previous occasions.4

3

Since the 10y is the average of the 5y and 5y5y, the contribution to the change in 10y of each component is half their change. The
chart shows the decomposition using inflation rates from inflation swaps. Using inflation breakeven rates results in a very similar picture
(not shown). We focus on inflation swaps in the main text because in the US inflation linked bonds suffer from significant liquidity issues
and because they are the underlying asset for inflation options, which we discuss later.

1: 5 year spot rates (5y) and 5-year rate 5-years forward (5y5y) extracted from inflation swaps and government Gilts.
Data and calculation details available here.

Looking at the pattern in the inflation compensation component, as opposed to the real component, we see
that the moves here have been somewhat different. Shorter-term inflation expectations and risks fell sharply
in the early phases of the Covid crisis, with 5y inflation compensation falling around 50bp. But the large falls
unwound quickly following the policy response to the pandemic, even as nominal rates remained low through
the summer months, meaning real yields were still falling as inflation compensation recovered initially.
Further out, 5y5y inflation compensation did not fall nearly as much in the downturn, by roughly 30bp, but
also unwound those smaller falls subsequently.
While real rates remain historically low, and account for the low level in nominal yields, inflation
compensation rates are now near their highs of the past decade, though just 10 to 20 bps above their levels
in 2019 (Chart 3, right) and still below the 2008-2010 period (Chart 3, left). They are not flashing warning
signs yet, but I would be increasingly uncomfortable if they increased materially further from these levels,
especially the 5y5y rates.5 A further rise in near-term inflation compensation rates would be less worrying,
since the MPC itself expects a temporary overshoot in CPI inflation relative to its target, and on top of that
the wedge between RPI and CPI is influenced by Bank Rate and house price dynamics.
Summarising the UK yield curve developments, initially both real rates and inflation rates fell sharply, so that
nominal rates reached all-time lows last summer across the whole maturity spectrum.6 Since then, both real
rates and inflation rates have risen as the economic outlook has improved and uncertainty has receded,
particularly since the start of the year. Increases in 5y rates were predominantly driven by a rise in inflation

5

When monitoring longer-term measures of inflation compensation, it is important to remind ourselves that these markets are not as
liquid as nominal rates markets, especially at longer horizons. These markets are used for hedging large pension liabilities, and hedging
flows can cause significant shifts in inflation compensation over and above those driven by changes in inflation expectation and
perceived inflation risks. Moreover, the levels of inflation compensation more than 10 years into the future are also affected by
expectations of future RPI reform, which makes them more difficult to interpret.

compensation back to the top end of its 2019 range, with real 5y rates remaining relatively subdued.
Movements in 5y5y rates, i.e. more distant forward rates, were predominantly driven by a rise in 5y5y real
rates as the risk of the economy remaining stuck in a low growth and subdued inflation state receded, with a
smaller contribution from a rise 5y5y inflation compensation.
Even though my main focus is clearly the developments in UK rates, I will also look at developments in the
US to illustrate the differences.7
The nominal yield moves in the US were larger in both directions. The US had a higher policy rate at the start
of the Covid crisis, so could cut the policy rate by more. Since the trough, US rates have risen more, and, as
in the UK, 5y5y forward rates are back to levels seen in early to mid-2019.
Where the US differs more markedly is in the relative contributions of real rates and inflation compensation to
these nominal yield patterns (Chart 2, right). Since last summer, 70% of the rise in nominal rates is due to
inflation, as opposed to 30% in the UK. 5y inflation compensation in the US is well above the levels that
prevailed pre-Covid, while 5y5y inflation compensation rates are slightly above their pre-Covid levels.
Compared with the UK‚Äôs 50bp fall and subsequent 70bp rise in 5y inflation rates, the US fell 110bp and rose
210bp. The sharper US increase was likely driven by three factors: first, unlike in the UK, US inflation
compensation rates before the Covid crisis were at levels below those consistent with the Fed‚Äôs inflation
target. Second, the Federal Reserve modified its inflation objective in the intervening period,8 so that a period
of above-2% post-Covid inflation expectations became a desired outcome. Third, the US has added a larger
fiscal stimulus than the UK into an economy that suffered a smaller Covid set-back than the UK.

3. Inflation expectations and risks
To gauge the risks to inflation expectations, we can go somewhat further than merely analysing the levels of
inflation compensation in financial markets. Next, I will look at the entire distribution of inflation expectations,
both in financial markets and in surveys. This allows us to see whether there is any sign of changes in the
perceived risks to inflation beyond the changes in mean inflation rates.
In the UK, inflation expectations measured from surveys of professional forecasters remain well anchored, as
can be seen in Chart 4 (left). Inflation expectations fell during the Covid crisis, and have subsequently
increased during the recovery. They are back to levels consistent with the MPC‚Äôs target, with risks around
the target now roughly balanced (Chart 4, right), having been skewed to the downside over the past year.

7

In the Eurozone, where inflation has been further below target for longer, government bond yields have risen much less, by only 40bp
since last August on the 10Y swap measure. The level of 10Y swap yields has just barely become positive again, at 0.15%.
8
In its ‚ÄúStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy‚Äù, updated on 27 August 2020, the FOMC amended the
formulation of its inflation targeting strategy to say: ‚ÄúIn order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee
seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been
running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for
some time.‚Äù

1: The moments are calculated from the forward (risk-neutral) distributions of inflation extracted from inflation caps and
floors, as described here.

Next, I examine the risk-neutral distribution for inflation compensation implied by options. There has been no
material change in the width of the distribution as measured by the standard deviation (Chart 5, left). And the
distribution of inflation compensation still has a downside skew, as has been the case for the past decade.
No sign therefore of either a rise in the magnitude of perceived inflation risks around the mean, nor of risks
being perceived to be more to the upside.
The story in the US is different, but consistent with movements in yield curve components discussed in the
previous section. Near-term inflation expectations have increased substantially, as the Fed‚Äôs new AIT
framework aims for an inflation overshoot for a period. But inflation risks further out have only unwound the
downside risks from recent quarters, not suggesting any particular perceived risk of higher inflation.

May 2021.
2: Balance of risks is the probability that inflation will be above 3% minus the probability it will be below 1%.

First, looking at inflation expectations from US surveys, shown in Chart 6 (left), in the short term there is a
significant overshoot expected in this year,9 but very little further out (see also Chart 7).10 And while the
balance of risks has now shifted to more upside risks (Chart 6, right), these are still modest. From the
distribution forecasts we can see that risks in the short run have shifted up, along with central expectations,
but risk of inflation exceeding 3% in the next couple of years remains within the range seen since 2000, and
is much lower than in the 1990s, and even further below the perceived risk in the 1970s or 1980s.11
Looking at US inflation options in financial markets confirms this picture of normalization in inflation and
inflation risks, with a short-term overshoot. The movements have been bigger than in the UK because US
inflation compensation and risks were at more depressed levels even prior to Covid. This likely reflects the
fact that US inflation itself has on average been below target in the post-financial crisis period. While the
standard deviation of the option-implied risk-neutral distribution has increased (Chart 8, left), it is still far
below the levels in the period of 2009 through 2013. The most significant change has been the shift from a
negative skew in the years prior to Covid, similar to the UK, to a more balanced risk in the short term and
even a modest positive skew at the 10 year horizon (Chart 8, right). But, while the upper tail of the inflation
distribution has increased more markedly than in the UK, it is still at levels well below 2009-2013, let alone
the 1970s or 1980s.

In Chart 6 I am showing the chart of CPI expectations, which peaks at 3%. The Fed‚Äôs target is 2%, but on the PCE measure. We have
data on PCE expectations as well, which peak at 2.7%, consistent with the historic CPI-PCE spread of around 30bp
10
Current forecast for average PCE inflation over next five years is 2.2% and next 10 years 2.1%, which means the 5y5y expected
inflation is 2%.
11
Core CPI and core CPE were only included in the SPF probabilities surveys since 2007, but probabilities for the inflation rate
measured by the GDP price deflator is available since 1968 for current calendar year, and from 1982 for next calendar year and show
similar picture for recent period but much higher before the 1990s.

In summary, evidence from surveys and option-implied distributions shows the same pattern as evidence
from the inflation component of the yield curve. Survey evidence in the UK remains consistent with the
MPC‚Äôs target. And there is no sign so far of emerging risk to the credibility of our target, either from surveys
of inflation distributions or inflation options. In the US the increase in inflation expectations is consistent with
a larger short-run overshooting, with a similar increase in upside inflation risks, consistent with the Fed‚Äôs new
framework of AIT. Nevertheless, even in the US both central expectations and upside risks remain very
modest by historical standards.

4. The role of QE
At the start of the Covid crisis in March 2020, there was significant financial turmoil, an episode often referred
to as the ‚Äúdash for cash‚Äù.12 The market turmoil was leading to a significant tightening in financial conditions,
which, if left unaddressed, would have led to a further worsening of the outlook for growth and inflation. The
MPC therefore voted to buy gilts and corporate bonds at a rapid pace to help restore market functioning and
thereby ease financial conditions. Those actions, alongside similar actions by other major central banks, as
well as an expansion of various central bank liquidity facilities, were highly successful.
This is consistent with a view of QE that I have expressed on a number of occasions, namely that it is a very
powerful tool to lower yields when market functioning is poor, by significantly increasing aggregate liquidity
through abundant reserves and signalling the willingness to offset shocks. But when market functioning is
restored, and if long term yields already at very low levels with inflation expectations near the target, in my
view the ability for QE to impart additional macro-economic stimulus is limited. In other words, the impact of
QE is state-contingent. I therefore voted in favour of the subsequent rounds of QE in June and November
last year largely because I thought they served as insurance against a renewed episode of tightening in
financial conditions due to market dysfunction, rather than because I was expecting to achieve an outright
further easing in the monetary stance.
One illustration of this is that, when market functioning had been restored, we lowered the pace of purchases
significantly, to well below the pace of government sales of new bonds. Yet yields remained little changed, as
shown in Chart 9 (left). Slowing the pace of purchased did not increase yields, and announcing increases in
the stock of purchases in June and November did not lower yields, although the further purchases might
have helped raise inflation expectations from depressed levels by reinforcing our commitment to fight
disinflationary forces. Relative to a counterfactual of no further QE, we lowered the risk of a premature rise in
yields that might otherwise have taken place, but it is not clear that the policy stance became materially more
stimulative once market functioning had been restored. A similar pattern can be seen in the US
(Chart 9, right), where the pace of Fed purchases was lowered much sooner, and from higher levels, but
yields remained little changed and very low.

See for example in Bailey (2020) ‚ÄúLIBOR: entering the endgame‚Äù, Hauser (2020) ‚ÄúSeven moments in Spring: Covid-19, financial
markets and the Bank of England's operations‚Äù, and Vlieghe (2020) ‚ÄúMonetary policy and the Bank of England‚Äôs balance sheet‚Äù

In the period between April and December 2020, the fact that UK 10y yields fell further than US yields, and
then remained lower relative to US yields, is largely attributable to expectations that UK policy rates might go
negative, rather than any QE effects. After the MPC announced that it was considering adding negative rates
to the toolkit, financial markets priced in an increasing probability of short term interest rates going negative
in the coming years (Chart 10). That probability remained elevated until the end of 2020. It was only in the
first few months of this year, when economic prospects recovered thanks to rapid rollout of the vaccine, that
financial markets judged that negative interest rates were less likely to be required in the UK.

5. QE and fiscal policy
One aspect of QE that has received increasing attention over the past year is its impact on the interest rate
sensitivity of government debt, and whether that impacts government debt sustainability and therefore feeds
back onto the level of yields.
The argument goes as follows.13 Normally the interest rate sensitivity of government debt is determined by
the maturity profile of the government bonds it has issued. Short-term bonds need to be refinanced at
prevailing interest rates in the coming years, so if interest rates rise along the yield curve, the interest cost to
the government will rise. Longer-term bonds, on the other hand, will not need to be refinanced for many
years, even decades, so they act to slow the impact of any yield rises on the interest costs faced by the
government.
But QE changes this calculation, by making the interest cost on government debt more sensitive to
short-term interest rates, in particular to the level of Bank Rate.
The main direct aim of QE is to lower long term borrowing costs once short-term interest rates are near their
effective lower bound (ELB). The MPC‚Äôs ultimate aim in doing this is unchanged from what it has always
been, namely to stimulate private sector spending in order to bring inflation back to target. As a side effect,
QE also lowers the borrowing costs for the government, since it works initially through long-term government
bond yields. However, once QE is in place, i.e. once the Bank of England has accumulated the government
bonds, it does increase the sensitivity of government finances to movements in short-term interest rates. The
reason for this is that, when one considers the balance sheets of the government and the Bank of England
together, the net effect of QE can be thought of as akin to swapping the cost of part of the government debt
from long-term interest rates to short-term interest rates (the rate paid on reserves, i.e. Bank Rate).14 The
total interest cost to the government, once the Bank of England settles any cash surplus or deficit in its APF
facility with government, can be calculated as follows:

Total interest cost = interest rate on gilts √ó gilts held by the private sector
+ Bank rate √ó gilts held by the Bank of England

That works in both directions. When short-term interest rates are low, as they have been for the past decade,
the interest cost faced by the government is also very low. Bank Rate has been below the yield on most gilts
for the past decade.15 But if Bank Rate rises, the interest cost faced by the government will immediately rise,

See also Vlieghe (2020) ‚ÄúMonetary policy and the Bank of England‚Äôs balance sheet‚Äù
This is not just a theoretical argument, there are actual observable cash flow implications. The costs of paying interest on reserves
reduces the transfer from the Bank to Treasury, including from APF gains.
15
The difference between Bank Rate and gilt yields at the time of APF purchases has resulted in approximately ¬£110 billion that has
been transferred from the Bank of England to HMT since the Asset Purchase Facility was created, which is how ‚Äì operationally ‚Äì the
reduction in the average financing cost manifests itself. We have always been clear that these flows would reverse once Bank Rate
rises sufficiently, and depending on how much yields have risen when the APF portfolio is reduced.

one for one, on the portion of government debt that is held by the Bank of England, which is roughly equal16
to the amount of reserves outstanding. That is in contrast to the more gradual pass-through of interest rises
on the portion of government debt that is held by the private sector, where interest rate costs only rise at the
pace at which bonds mature and need to be refinanced.
Why am I discussing these technicalities? There is a lot of confusion about this. The objective of QE is to
help the MPC hit the inflation target. Any impact on government finances is incidental, and does not play any
role in the MPC‚Äôs deliberations. Nevertheless, people ask whether QE is good for the government finances,
or bad for the government finances, whether government debt is more or less sustainable due to QE?
QE, to the extent that it fosters a stronger economic recovery than we would have seen without QE, is
unambiguously good for government finances because a stronger recovery leads to more tax revenues and
lower expenditures. QE also lowers the average government interest burden by keeping longer term interest
rates low. But, once short-term interest rates do start to rise, whenever that may be, the interest cost on the
overall debt position will increase somewhat faster, though from a lower level.

Notes: Nominal weighted average maturity, excluding
inflation uplift, including Treasury bills.

Chart 11 (left) illustrates these mechanisms. Following the rise in government borrowing after the financial
crises and after the Covid crisis, government debt has increased as a share of GDP. And a larger share of
that debt (about a third, as shown by the red), is now affected immediately by Bank Rate changes, rather
than affected gradually by changes in yields along the yield curve.
This mechanism applies to any country that has carried out QE. Chart 11 (right) shows, however, that the UK
is still an outlier internationally in the relatively long average maturity of its government bonds. Reassuringly,
16

The quantity of reserves is not exactly equal to the quantity of gilts held by the Bank of England, because there are some other assets
backing reserves as well, but these are fairly small as a share of the total balance sheet.

13

that means that, on the portion of government bonds held by the private sector, any rises in yields will be
reflected into the government debt burden only slowly, compared to countries that have a shorter average
maturity of debt.
It is also worth pointing out that while QE has acted to make the government debt cost more sensitive to
short term interest rates, over the same period the DMO has increased the average maturity of new
issuance. One way to estimate the net effect of these two countervailing forces is shown in Chart 12.
I re-calculate the weighted average maturity of government debt, but assign a maturity of zero to the portion
of the debt that is held by the Bank of England. Of course the maturity is not actually zero, in fact the true
maturity is however long the Bank of England keeps and reinvests those bonds. But assigning a zero
maturity for the purposes of this chart captures the idea that the interest cost of this part of the debt is entirely
driven by very short-term (i.e. zero maturity) interest rates, namely Bank Rate. The conclusion is that the
adjusted weighted average maturity is roughly at the same level it was a decade ago. In other words,
post-2010 rounds of QE have roughly offset the effect of the increase in the maturity of DMO issuance.

6. Outlook for inflation and policy
Let me now turn to the outlook for the growth, inflation and monetary policy.
The economic impact of the Covid crisis was unprecedented: the UK experienced the largest GDP
contraction in 300 years.
The policy response was similarly unprecedented: the largest ever peacetime rise in the fiscal deficit, and
largest ever increase in the Bank of England‚Äôs balance sheet.
It will be some time before we know how successful these policies have been, but I would say, so far so
good. The unemployment rate has only risen by about a percentage point, despite a 10% annual contraction
14

14

in GDP, in large part due to the government‚Äôs furlough scheme protecting people‚Äôs income as well as their
connection to their employer. Fiscal policy has done the heavy lifting in this downturn.
With significant help from the government‚Äôs credit easing schemes and Bank of England policy actions to
keep borrowing costs low and ensure orderly functioning of funding and asset markets, credit provision
throughout the pandemic generally worked well. A strongly capitalised financial system was able to help
firms absorb the shock.
This year, the unprecedented contraction in GDP is likely to give way to an unprecedented rate of growth in
GDP, such that by the end of the year the MPC expects to have regained the pre-Covid level of GDP. There
is some temptation to call that a boom. I think it is more accurate to call it a prospective return towards
normal. During this return towards normal, we should be prepared for some erratic price moves as not all
sectors experience a return of demand at the same speed, which may create temporary bottle-necks. These
temporary price moves, along with significant base effects, are likely to push inflation above our target
temporarily later this year and early next year.

Economic prospects are better now than they have been at any time over the past year, thanks to the
on-going rapid rollout of vaccinations, but we are not out of the woods yet. Internationally, new virus cases
remain elevated, which continues to weigh on global economic activity. In the UK, we are still dealing with
so-called ‚ÄúVariants of Concern‚Äù, which may yet affect the pace at which the Covid-related restrictions can
safely be eased. On the domestic economy front, we still have the wind-down of the furlough scheme ahead
of us. While the MPC expect most furloughed workers to be reintegrated into the labour market smoothly,
this process is subject to significant uncertainty. We are talking about millions of workers (Chart 13), and

15

15

even if only a small share of them end up in unemployment later this year, that could lead to a rise in
unemployment that is of macro-economic significance.17
The fact that we will have temporarily high GDP growth rates and temporarily higher inflation in the coming
months is not the main focus of monetary policy. Instead, monetary policy will focus on returning inflation
sustainably to its target, which will require focusing on the medium-term outlook for inflation, and therefore
the medium-term pressure of demand on supply, rather than transient factors. This approach to monetary
policy is outlined clearly in the MPC‚Äôs May Monetary Policy Statement and Minutes.

It will be a communications challenge to keep reminding people of the likely temporary nature of the
upcoming inflation. CPI inflation is likely to move above the target (Chart 14), as I have already mentioned,
due to base effects and temporary price rises due to supply bottle-necks in the face of uneven demand.
When CPI inflation is affected by temporary factors and base effects, one cross-check of underlying inflation
pressures is to look at wage inflation. But wage inflation is affected by temporary factors and base effects as
well. Year-over-year growth in Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) is likely to rise sharply in the coming months
before slowing again later this year ‚Äì and this will happen regardless of the underlying strength of the labour
market. Chart 15 shows the evolution of the year-over-year growth rate of private sector regular AWE on the
illustrative assumptions that wages grow at 0%, 2% and 4% respectively from the most recent data point.
The chart illustrates that in all three scenarios the year-over-year growth rate is set to spike sharply to 7-8%,
before falling back in subsequent months.

17

Note that the mapping between furloughed jobs and unemployed persons is not going to be one for one. That is because a single
worker can be furloughed from two jobs at the same time. Thus, if after the end of the furlough scheme they cannot return to either job
and become unemployed, it would add only one person to the unemployment rate. Or, alternatively, if they lose one of them but return
to the other, they would not be counted as unemployed at all.

Aside from CPI and wage inflation, commentators point to all kinds of indicators that have not been
particularly reliable in the past in order to make the case for persistent inflationary pressure.
Some cite rapid money growth, which has not been a reliable inflation indicator for decades. Rapid money
growth has not been a counterpart to rapid credit expansion. Instead, high deposit balances reflect excess
savings accumulated by higher income households, who have maintained a steady wage income but have
seen their spending opportunities temporarily curtailed. In the May MPC forecast, only a small share of that
income is expected to be spent, with the remainder saved. These are not the ingredients of an inflationary
money and credit expansion. Instead, I expect money growth to slow.
Some cite rising commodity prices as evidence of a persistent inflationary problem. The price of lumber is a
favourite, and it makes for a spectacular chart indeed (Chart 16, left). But inflation is not about the increase in
the price of a few commodities. It is about broad-based and on-going price increases. Moving our focus
simply from some isolated commodities to broad indices of a range of commodities, the picture is much less
spectacular (Chart 16, right). The commodity price increases are more modest than in 2011, and it is worth
remembering that even in 2011 their rise did not signal any persistent inflationary pressure.
What will ultimately tell us whether inflation pressures require a policy response or will turn out to be transient
without a policy response, is the passage of time. I suspect that upward underlying inflation pressure will only
emerge once economic slack has been fully eroded, which in turn will require a smooth transition of the
economy out of furlough. Only once the furlough scheme has ended will we have a better idea of how much
underlying slack there is in the labour market.

Sources: Eikon by Refinitiv. Latest observation: 21 May 2021.

Some argue that it will be too late if we wait for the data to give us clarity on underlying inflation pressure. I
do not put much weight on such arguments, for three reasons.
First, given the proximity of the effective lower bound (even with the possibility of modestly negative rates),
tightening too early would be a much costlier mistake than tightening too late. The international experience of
the past two decades has taught us that premature tightening can lead to even more easing later, with below
target inflation.
Second, monetary policy does, in fact, work quite quickly.18 It does not take years for interest rates increases
to start having an effect. As long as we make clear that we will not tolerate persistent deviations of inflation
from target, and act accordingly, inflation expectations are unlikely to drift, and inflation will not become a
persistent problem. Comparisons with the 1970s are misplaced, and fail to take into account that the
institutional framework for monetary policy has fundamentally changed since then.
Third, as I have discussed many times before, I think we continue to find ourselves in an environment where
the neutral rate of interest, namely the rate at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor putting the
brakes on the economy and inflation, is very low relative to the past several decades. That was apparent
before we were hit by the Covid shock, when Bank Rate was just 0.75% and inflation pressures were too
weak. A low neutral interest rate will remain relevant once the Covid shock has passed. If anything, Covid
may have lowered it by increasing the perception of tail risks.19 So if interest rates do need to rise once the
data show that medium-term inflationary pressures are rising, then I suspect that interest rates will not need
to rise very much to slow the economy to a pace that is consistent with our 2% inflation target.

18

For example, Cloyne and H√ºrtgen (2016) find that in post-1992 samples inflation reacts quickly to monetary policy with sizeable
effects in the first and second year after the shock, as do Ellis et al. (2014). These findings for the UK are corroborated by Cesa-Bianchi
et al. (2020). For the US, Olivei and Tenreyro (2007) find a fast transmission of monetary policy to inflation depending on the timing of
the shock which they explain using a structural model of unevenly staggered wage setting.
19
For the role of macro-economic tail risk in determining the level of the neutral interest rate see Vlieghe (2019) ‚ÄúMonetary policy:
adapting to a changed world‚Äù.

7. Illustrative scenarios and preferred paths of Bank Rate

I will conclude by briefly describing some illustrative scenarios for the economy in the coming years, and
what my preferred Bank Rate path might look like in each of these scenarios. These scenarios fall within the
fan chart of the May Monetary Policy Report. The Bank Rate paths I am showing in Chart 17 are consistent
with the MPC‚Äôs guidance on monetary policy, but the guidance encompasses a wide range of other paths as
well. I want to be very clear that these are my own personal views, and do not represent the view of the
MPC. And I emphasise that any future rate path that I discuss is not a promise, it is my own forecast based
on a particular economic scenario. If the data turn out differently, so will the associated rate path.

Notes: Diamonds show hypothetical level of Bank Rate in one, two, and three years‚Äô time.

My central scenario is that the economy evolves similarly to the MPC‚Äôs central projection in May, but with
somewhat more slack than in the central projection. Relative to the MPC‚Äôs central projection, I worry that the
transition out of furlough does involve a modest rise in the unemployment rate, while the economy‚Äôs supply
potential is somewhat less adversely affected, so that there is still some excess supply around the turn of the
year. In that scenario, the first rise in Bank Rate is likely to become appropriate only well into next year, with
some modest further tightening thereafter.
On the upside, should the transition out of furlough happen more smoothly, with the unemployment rate at or
a little below current levels by the end of the year, with associated signs of upward inflation and wage
pressure beyond the temporary and base effects, then a somewhat earlier rise in Bank Rate would be
appropriate. It would probably take until the first quarter of next year to have a clear view of the post-furlough
unemployment and wage dynamics, so a rise in Bank Rate could be appropriate soon after, along a slightly
steeper path than in my central case.
On the downside, the economy might not recover as quickly, perhaps as lingering concerns about ‚Äúvariants
of concern‚Äù continue to weigh on demand, which in turn results in more adverse unemployment dynamics as
19

fewer furloughed workers are hired back straight away, with weaker underlying wage pressure. In that case,
it is still possible that monetary policy might be required to simulate the economy a little further to help
eliminate slack and ensure inflation, after its temporary rise later this year, does not subsequently fall back
below its 2% target persistently.
