Introduction

Many of you will have seen the new Financial Stability Report (FSR) that we published
in July. Our aim in that Report was to set out more concisely and clearly than in previous
years what we considered the main risks to the stability of the UK’s financial system.

The bottom line was that the financial system looked pretty resilient to disturbances in the
near-term, but there were some underlying, longer term, vulnerabilities lurking in the
background.

Some related to potential mismatches or mis-pricing in international

financial markets. Others to extended balance sheet positions at home and abroad. And
some reflected structural dependencies across the financial system, for example, on the
smooth functioning of financial infrastructure. Our view was that they were unlikely to
cause problems in the near future but there was a non-negligible risk that they could
crystallise rapidly and disruptively for the financial system.

On past form we would be publishing the next Report this month but we have decided to
change the publication schedule. Future FSRs will appear in the Spring and Autumn
rather than Summer and Winter. So the 2007 editions are planned for late April and late
October.

But in case four months is too long to wait, I want to use my comments today to set out
our assessment of prospects for financial stability as we near the end of 2006.

Recent developments

Our view remains that near-term risks to UK financial stability are low.

That is mainly a reflection of the continuation of broadly benign macroeconomic
conditions in the UK and globally A rebalancing in global sources of growth does appear
to be under way - and we are watching developments in the US economy and movements
in the US dollar closely – but overall the global economy remains strong.

UK financial institutions profitability and capital levels have remained robust, providing
them with a buffer against future disturbances.

Financial markets have also demonstrated resilience over the past six months. Markets
were turbulent at the time we were preparing the July FSR. It was unclear whether we
were at the start of a significant correction. The subsequent rebound in asset prices, and
declines in measures of volatility, showed that it was a pause not a sustained change in
risk appetite.

More recently, we have seen huge losses at the Amaranth hedge fund. These losses
exceeded those of LTCM, yet markets facilitated a smooth wind down in positions. That
is reassuring though some questions remain about the capacity of markets to handle such
a disturbance if the macroeconomic backdrop and the balance sheets of major institutions
were less rosy. The incident may also raise some questions about how effectively market
forces are acting to restrain those taking outsized risk positions, something that I will
return to in a moment.

Taken together, these developments provide a strong baseline for financial stability. But
the risks that we pointed to in July are still there. In particular, we pointed to the risk that
financial firms concerned about losing market share in rapidly expanding markets might
pay less attention than they should to their resilience to unexpected shocks.

[Chart 1] gives our assessment of developments since July. It shows that a number of the
vulnerabilities have edged up a little as leveraged buy-out (LBO) activity and commercial
property lending have grown and as the number of personal insolvencies has increased.
3

On the other hand, the slowdown in the US economy and the beginning of a narrowing in
its trade balance may have reduced the risks on that side, although we didn’t judge this
material enough to change our overall assessment.

We know how easy and how fruitless it can be to draw up long lists of things that could
go wrong without paying attention to their likelihood. So we try to take a balanced view
that recognises not just what could go wrong but also recognises changes that we think
have a positive impact on financial stability. For example, I have been clear that, in the
long run, the growth of derivative markets and the development of new players like hedge
funds should help to price risks better and spread them more widely, and thus make the
financial system more resilient.

However, there is no denying that financial markets are liable to overshoot. And it is
particularly important to stay alive to this risk when new records are being set for
leveraged bids, returns on equity and City bonuses. Over-optimism in the financial
system can have costs not just for the consenting counterparties but more broadly across
the economy. By talking to you individually, drawing the threads together with our own
analysis and feeding back a dispassionate but informed assessment of what your actions
and plans add up to, we hope we can inform your decisions and thus help to head off
instability.

Low volatility

One of the main vulnerabilities on our league table is low risk premia in financial markets
– that is, the low level of compensation that investors are demanding to hold risk. In my
remaining remarks I want to offer some observations on a closely related and
interconnected topic: the low level of volatility in a number of asset classes.

My colleague Paul Tucker has recently commented on low historic volatility. [Charts 2 to
4] show how the volatility of asset returns has come down for equities, bonds, and
exchange rates to low levels by modern standards. One needs to go back to the Bretton
Woods era to get volatility levels as low as at present.

4

Of course the reduction in the volatility of returns – and the lower compensation for
future volatility embedded in risk premia – is responding to some real changes in the
world. You might break down sources of uncertainty about future returns into three
components: macroeconomic risks, financial risks and risks in the broader environment.

Macroeconomic volatility has fallen considerably over the last decade in many economies
[Chart 5]. In the real economy, greater flexibility in labour and product markets,
especially openness to foreign competition through trade and immigration, has enabled
smoother adjustment to shocks. On the price side, central bank independence and
inflation targeting have contributed to greater price stability.

There is also greater depth and sophistication and fewer rigidities in financial markets.
Innovation has created a variety of products enabling more and better risk transfer by
financial market players and greater choice for end-investors. Greater financial market
flexibility can support macroeconomic stability by keeping credit and liquidity available
during periods of stress.

But risks in the broader environment haven’t gone away. Threats from ecological or
biological disasters, fraud, political conflict and terrorism seem as high as ever. And these
are risks we have identified. As ever there may be some significant “unknown
unknowns”.

So while there are some good reasons for the reduction in financial risk premia significant
risks do remain. The question is how well are they priced? Are there any reasons for
thinking that markets may be underpricing risk? I think there may be.

Low risk premia and low volatility

Sustained low economic and financial market volatility is bound to have implications for
the level of compensation for risk that investors require in asset prices.

In theory if assets become fundamentally less risky, then investors should receive a
capital gain but should accept a lower future rate of return. If there have been signs of the
capital gains, it is less clear that investors have revised down their expectations of rates of
5

return on their portfolios. Indeed the pressure is to go beyond performing relatively well
against your peers and to produce absolute returns. This has been fuelling a fierce search
for yield and for ‘excess returns’ by asset managers who have to respond to this demand.
Delivering on such a commitment in a world of low volatility takes impressive stock
picking skills; buying or selling mis-priced assets and spotting emerging trends before the
rest of the market.

Clearly not everyone can beat the market. Some asset managers will be able to do so for
a while either through luck or good judgement and their challenge is to keep ahead –
often with the extra funds that their performance has attracted. Their competitors face
added pressure to catch up. Both are bound to be tempted to take on greater risk to
generate absolute returns.

Of course this syndrome is widely recognised. Investment mandates and management
remuneration are often measured against a risk-adjusted benchmark to avoid rewarding
such activity. But it can take considerable efforts to spot such behaviour. The
proliferation of new and highly complex financial instruments is making it harder to
assess the incidence of underlying risk. The assumptions underlying the valuation of
positions in such instruments are often unclear.

Many of these products have the effect of selling insurance against unlikely financial
market events. In so far as there has been a genuine increase in the stability of the
economy and financial markets, selling volatility is less risky than it used to be. But it
can be more risky than it appears.

Our market contacts often cite the example of selling ‘out-of-the-money’ options as a
popular strategy recently. Here the seller receives a steady stream of small payments
today in return for paying up in the unlikely event that the price of an underlying
instrument moves significantly from its current value. With sufficient leverage, a small
payment stream can be turned into a tidy return. But as all insurers know, the key to long
term return is to spread your risks widely or to avoid correlated risks.

In assessing risk in financial markets, a common metric is correlation of positions with
the market return. But this is quite inappropriate in this case. The value of a ‘deeply-out6

of-the-money’ option has relatively low correlation with movements in the price of the
underlying instrument or the market generally. So a simple measure of riskiness based on
historical correlations will mistakenly show a leveraged out-of-the-money option trade as
providing a good risk/return trade-off. In the jargon, selling volatility protection can be
one way to generate ‘beta disguised as alpha’.

One would usually expect that any mispricing of risk here would be counteracted by
market forces. Countervailing strategies – buying volatility - should be profitable in the
long run. The problem is that it requires patience, persistence and deep pockets. Going
‘long’ volatility means being prepared to make regular small payments and hoping to be
compensated by a large irregular payoff. In a world of short run return targets, it is not
surprising to find this is unpopular.

If mispricing of this sort is underway it would show up in higher asset prices and lower
implied volatilities across a range of markets. And implied volatilities are at or around
historic lows in equity markets, bond markets, credit markets and foreign exchange
markets [Chart 6-8] despite the market turbulence during May and June and recent
rumblings on the dollar.

Implications of low risk premia

These low levels of implied volatility – and associated low level of risk premia – can have
real implications for the economy and the stability of the financial system.

In the corporate sector, for example, low risk premia may be one factor that has supported
the rapid growth in private equity backed LBOs [Chart 9]. Spreads on high yield
corporate debt have narrowed sharply in recent years, to the point where there seems very
little compensation for credit risk, and almost none for liquidity risk [Chart 10]. A
combination of squeezed corporate credit spreads and low reference risk-free government
yields has resulted in the lowest nominal cost of borrowing for corporates since the 1950s.

In the July FSR we included a rough estimate that - other things equal - LBOs in 2004 and
2005 would raise the future probability of corporate default by 20 basis points. Given
recent activity we now estimate it will add around 40 basis points over coming years
7

relative to the current average probability of corporate default of about 2.0%. Given the
funds already raised by private equity firms, this might be expected to increase further in
2007.

Furthermore, there is anecdotal evidence that other corporates have increased leverage in
defence – taking the view that it is imprudent to be ‘under-geared’ in an environment
where private equity firms are flush with cash. Indeed, the CFO of one FTSE 250
company which geared up significantly to avoid being taken over remarked that “we have
seen almost no drawbacks from being junk”.

Another example of low implied volatilities and risk premia affecting risk taking occurs
in cross border capital flows. In this case, low implied volatilities on interest rates and
exchange rates can support cross-border carry trades because the yield pick up looks
attractive when you can hedge the worst risks quite cheaply [Chart 11]. The continued
smooth financing of global imbalances through these carry-trades in turn leads to low
volatility. But this can of course work in reverse. Foreign exchange volatility has jumped
up since the US Thanksgiving Day holiday. If this volatility were to persist the perceived
risks in the carry trade would increase.

The common characteristic of these examples is that low implied volatilities reduce the
apparent riskiness of portfolios and can encourage investors to take on more risk. And if
implied volatilities are not a good measure of future volatility, they will end up bearing
more risk than they expected.

Avoiding this pitfall requires diligent risk assessment by investors and other
counterparties. That is what is needed for market discipline to do its work. It requires
both adequate disclosure of risk-relevant information and its effective use in investment
decisions. In the case of the hedge fund sector, for example, it seems likely that greater
institutional investor interest will continue to raise the bar on disclosure requirements,
particularly for those generating returns using complex products where traditional
measures like value-at-risk (VaR) may fail to capture fully the underlying risks.

Conclusions

To conclude, our overall assessment remains benign. The financial sector is strongly
capitalised and well placed to handle even large shocks like Amaranth. The rapid pace of
innovation in financial markets also promises better and wider distribution of risk which
is good not just for the financial sector’s stability but should support more risk taking in
the real economy. Greater investment could deliver stronger medium and long term
growth.

But there remain a number of sources of vulnerability in the world economy and in
financial markets which firms need to bear in mind.

Volatility is low, and as time passes longer memories are needed to remember when it
was high. While there have certainly been improvements in macro performance in recent
years, I do not know a central banker who is not surprised at the faith that markets appear
to have in us to keep the great stability going. And the risks in the wider environment are
as great as ever.

It is not clear to me that these risks are fully priced into the market. Market forces may
not have been able to correct any excess optimism given the incentives and constraints of
participants operating in a world with a good deal of opaqueness about risk taking.

In closing, I would stress that I am not saying market participants should avoid risk. But I
do think it is important that market participants recognise that risk has not gone away, and
that there are limits in the ability of financial engineering to insulate the financial system
in aggregate against risk. Given the rapid pace of innovation in financial markets and
products and the low level of risk premia, investors may need to take particular care to
understand the risks they are exposed to. More than in the past, they may need to ask
some searching questions about how funds are being invested and how risks are being
managed. One approach might be to put greater emphasis on stress test results as well as
more conventional risk metrics. Failure to ask probing questions could prove costly for
those directly involved – and, of greater concern, to others in the system – as and when
the credit cycle turns.
