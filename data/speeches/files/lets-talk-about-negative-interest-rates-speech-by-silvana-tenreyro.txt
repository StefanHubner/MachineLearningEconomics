External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England
UWE Bristol webinar
11 January 2021

I would like to thank Lewis Kirkham, Michael McLeay and Lukas von dem Berge for superb research and
useful discussions. I would also like to thank Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Jonathan Bridges,
Maren Froemel, Julia Giese, Andy Haldane, Jonathan Haskel, Andrew Hauser, Silvia Miranda-Agrippino,
Inderjit Sian, Michael Saunders, Ryland Thomas, Matt Trott and Jan Vlieghe for helpful comments,
suggestions and assistance. The views are my own and should not be taken to represent those of the
Bank of England or its committees.

Good afternoon and thanks for having me. It is a pleasure to give this speech, virtually, at UWE Bristol.
Over the past year, the MPC used a range of policy tools to contribute to supporting the economy and
bringing inflation back to target. We also discussed various other tools that might be needed at some point in
future. We always keep our toolkit under review, and given the events of 2020, I am sure it is not surprising
that those discussions continued over the year. The MPC set out its collective view on one of those tools,
negative interest rates, in a box in its August 2020 Monetary Policy Report.
Following that, the Bank of England began structured engagement with firms on operational considerations
regarding the feasibility of negative interest rates. That work is still in progress, and the Bank will report back
when it is complete; I do not have anything new to add on this today.
Once the Bank is satisfied that negative rates are feasible, then the MPC would face a separate decision
over whether they are the optimal tool to use to meet the inflation target given circumstances at the time. As
with decisions on any other monetary policy tool, each MPC member would have the option to vote on this at
each meeting. We are individually accountable for our votes, and are required to explain their rationale to the
public and to parliament. Today I therefore wish to set out my own current thinking on how negative interest
rates might work in the UK. While this view will inform my future votes, my decisions on the amount of policy
stimulus needed (and the right tool to deliver it) will depend on the outlook at the time of voting. I will make
three main points:


First, the ‘financial-market channels’ of monetary policy transmission have worked effectively under
negative rates in other countries, with some of the evidence pointing to more powerful effects.
Through standard cost of capital and exchange-rate mechanisms, as well as higher asset prices,
these effects should lead to higher consumption and investment, and boost net exports and inflation.
Quantitatively, these channels are an important part of monetary policy transmission.



Second, the evidence from experiences of negative rates in other countries suggests that
‘bank-lending channels’ of monetary policy transmission have also been effective at boosting lending
and activity, though there is some variation in the size of the estimated effects. There is no clear
evidence that negative rates have reduced bank profits overall, and a number of studies find positive
impacts, once you take into account the boost to the economy.



Third, as with any policy tool, there are differences in the structure of the economy, both across
countries and over time, which can potentially affect how the tool works. But there is little evidence to
suggest that many aspects of policy would operate differently from usual. It is possible that the
current structure of the UK banking system could lead to a less positive impact on bank profitability.

But at worst, in my view, this could only make bank-lending channels slightly less powerful than
otherwise, while I expect the financial-market channels to work normally.
I will start by explaining what negative rates are and how they might work (Section 1), before touching on the
global economic forces that have led several other central banks to implement them (Section 2). I will then
summarise my views on the international evidence on negative interest rates (Section 3, going into more
detail in Section 3.1). Next, I will discuss some differences across countries and over time that can affect
how policies work (Section 4). Finally, I will update on how I see the current economic outlook (Section 5).

What are negative interest rates?

Over 2020, there was no shortage of media coverage discussing the possibility of the MPC adopting a
negative interest rate policy. But the concept of a negative interest rate probably sounds strange to many
people in the UK. Even among professional economists, many of us were taught that the economy and
monetary policy would operate very differently when interest rates were below zero. Before discussing the
effectiveness of such a policy, I would therefore like to talk about what we mean by negative rates; how, in
general terms, they would work; and whether they actually are so different to what we have seen before.1
When we talk about potentially using negative interest rates, we are referring to Bank Rate, the policy rate
set by the MPC. Bank Rate is the interest rate paid on central bank reserves, which are deposits held at the
Bank of England by banks and building societies.2 At present, with a slightly positive Bank Rate of 0.1%,
these institutions receive one pound per year in interest for each thousand pounds they have deposited.3
Under a negative Bank Rate, they would instead pay an interest charge on their reserves. At a negative rate
of 0.1% applied on all reserves, for example, a £1000 deposit would be reduced to £999 after one year.4
Just as at positive levels of Bank Rate, the interest payments made between the Bank and commercial
banks have little direct impact on the economy. Instead, Bank Rate matters because it influences the entire
set of rates charged on loans and paid on deposits of households and businesses; and because it affects the
exchange rate and a range of asset prices set by financial markets.
Importantly, Bank Rate is only one of many influences on these asset prices and rates. A negative Bank
Rate does not therefore imply that rates facing households and businesses will necessarily turn negative.
With Bank Rate currently close to zero, the average rate charged on loans to UK households is 2.6% while
the average rate paid on household deposits is 0.2% (Chart 1). Many other factors are incorporated into
1

See Bean (2013) for a clear previous explanation of negative interest rates and how they might work in the UK.
One can think of the Bank of England as the bank of (commercial) banks and building societies.
3
With total reserve balances of around £770 billion, the Bank pays out a total sum of around £770 million per year at current Bank Rate.
4
The payment would also depend on how any negative rate scheme was implemented, which has differed across countries. If negative
rates were implemented, the design of the scheme would be part of that decision. See Saunders (2020) for a discussion of these issues.

these rates, including: the risk to the bank of borrowers defaulting; the value of any collateral; the cost of
banks’ other funding sources; how Bank Rate is likely to evolve; and banks’ market share and profit
objectives.5 These other influences are far more important for the level of many loan rates – for example, the
average advertised rate on a £5,000 personal loan, which offers no collateral and has a relatively high risk of
default, is currently 8.2%.

These other influences also vary over time. Loan and deposit rates fell between 2013 and 2016 when Bank
Rate did not change (Chart 1).6 And new mortgage rates also fell over 2019, shortly after Bank Rate had
been increased. But holding other influences constant, changes in Bank Rate do tend to feed through to
changes in rates facing households and businesses. Because other influences are never held constant in
reality, this ‘pass through’ is often easier to see following large changes in Bank Rate. The clearest recent
example was the sharp fall in loan and deposit rates in 2008-09, following a 4.5 percentage point cut in Bank
Rate.
As with the 2008-09 reductions in positive territory, a cut to negative policy rates would aim to transmit to the
economy through two main sets of channels: via the banking sector and via financial markets. Through
banks, a negative rate would aim to lower rates facing households and businesses – most importantly loan
rates – which would in turn boost consumption and investment spending, income and inflation. A modestly
negative policy rate would not translate into negative borrowing rates for households and businesses, but
would intend to lower them compared to a scenario with a positive policy rate. Lower loan rates increase

An important factor here was a fall in banks’ wholesale funding costs from elevated levels during the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis.

borrowers’ spending power and encourage them to bring forward consumption and investment, and looser
borrowing conditions support property prices, in turn stimulating spending via wealth and collateral channels.
These bank-lending channels would add to transmission from financial-market channels of policy, just as at
positive policy rates. Lower market interest rates reduce yields on corporate bonds, depreciate the
exchange-rate and boost equity prices. In turn, a lower corporate cost of capital encourages investment; a
weaker exchange rate boosts net trade and inflation; and higher asset prices increase wealth and spending.
When spending is weak and inflation is undershooting our target, the MPC typically lowers policy rates to
boost jobs and growth, and ultimately return inflation to target, consistent with our remit.
Despite the similarities, until recently, there was a widely-held view that interest rates could not turn negative.
Generations of economists were taught in our textbooks that once policy rates fell to zero, interest-rate policy
could no longer affect the economy.7 We have been conditioned to view zero as a hard constraint – the zero
lower bound – on policy rates.8 Perhaps as a result, even though many central banks cut rates close to zero
following the 2008-09 financial crisis, it was several years until any took them below zero (Chart 2).

The textbook view was that interest rates could not turn negative owing to the existence of cash. Cash pays
zero interest at all times, and banks are free to exchange their interest-bearing reserves for it.9
Consequently, if Bank Rate was negative, banks could avoid having to pay interest by swapping all of their
reserves for banknotes. Similarly, if bank deposits charged a negative rate – or charged a fee greater than
any interest paid out – consumers could close their accounts and keep banknotes under the metaphorical
mattress. In the scenario portrayed in textbooks, even a very slightly negative interest rate would lead
everyone to demand all of their deposits to be converted into cash.
What changed was the realisation that the costs of holding cash are significant, especially for large
depositors or banks.10 While holding a few banknotes is little burden, holding large quantities involves costs
related to security, storage and convenience. And while in the past cash was usually thought of as a more
convenient means of payment than deposits, for many the reverse is now true.
These realisations, along with real-world examples abroad, have made clear that negative policy rates are
possible. Banks and large depositors are willing to incur interest payments on their holdings to avoid the
costs of storing and using cash, at least in the short-term, though uncertainty remains about exactly how far
negative rates could go before large-scale cash hoarding took place.11
Although there are now several examples abroad, we have never before used a negative policy rate in the
UK. To many people who remember well the high interest rates of the 1970s and 1980s, when the policy rate
reached a high of 17%, the low interest rates we have recently experienced may seem like a dramatic
change. But looking further back, low or even negative interest rates do not actually mark such a huge
departure. And, I will argue, some of the seemingly high rates in the past were a nominal illusion.

9
Over the years, many authors have also noted that in principle, different policies or technologies could overcome the zero lower bound.
See Buiter (2009), Kimball (2015) and Rognlie (2016) for discussions. Suggestions date back to Silvio Gesell’s 1916 idea to tax paper
currency, which would be equivalent to having a negative interest rate on cash, and so would lower the rate at which people would wish
to substitute out of interest-bearing deposits. All these solutions amount to either removing or reducing the effective lower bound. This is
a separate proposition from the experiences we have seen so far in other countries, which have taken the cash constraint as given.
More recently, Rogoff (2014) and Haldane (2015) have discussed the possibility that at some point in future, it is conceivable that a
widely-used government issued digital currency could remove the lower bound by facilitating deeply negative rates on deposits.
10
Textbooks typically assumed that the lower bound was zero under the current monetary system, although some authors allowed that
it may be slightly negative, given storage costs for cash, but these were often assumed to be small enough that they could be neglected,
as in Hicks (1937). McCallum (2000), for example, speculates that interest rates could only be negative by “a few basis points”.
11
The answer would likely depend on how long interest rates were significantly negative. Longer periods would incentivise banks to
invest more in storage facilities. More generally, as discussed earlier, the effective lower bound can be affected by policy decisions.

Notes: Bank Rate is year-end rate, sight deposit rate is calendar-year average of monthly rates. To obtain real rates year-on-year
realised CPI inflation in the subsequent year is subtracted from the relevant nominal interest rate.

Over a longer span of history, there were many previous periods when Bank Rate was set at a low positive
level (Chart 3). The high nominal interest rates before inflation targeting was adopted were the exceptions
rather than the rule.12 The dark blue line shows sight deposit rates actually paid to households were typically
lower still. Moreover, real deposit rates – that is, interest rates adjusted for price inflation, which is the most
economically meaningful measure – have been negative many times before (light blue line). But many of us
are prone to money illusion – considering the nominal value of payments, rather than the real value of goods
and services they can purchase.13 As a result, we may regard negative (real) deposit rates as more unusual
than they actually are.

Recent trends in global interest rates

An important question is what has caused the trend over the last 40 years towards low and negative interest
rates in many advanced economies?
Long-term real interest rates are determined by the balance between global savings and investment.14 They
have fallen over the past 40 years (Chart 4) because a range of slow-moving factors made desired
investment fall relative to desired saving.15 These include a fall in productivity growth; greater risk; and

12

Vlieghe (2017) makes the same point for real interest rates.
For example, see Shafir et al (1997) and Darriet et al (2019).
14
The interest rate which balances the amount of global savings and investment over time is known as the trend equilibrium real interest
rate. A box in the August 2018 Inflation Report discussed the factors which have influenced this in recent years.
15
Rachel and Summers (2019) suggest that it has fallen over 300 basis points in a generation.

Notes: Realised CPI inflation in a given year (from BIS) is subtracted from the nominal bond yield in that year (from OECD via FRED).

Ultimately, although central banks can set short-run interest rates, monetary policy has little influence over
these structural factors. The MPC, like most other monetary policy committees, is guided by its remit to meet
the inflation target. And so it must take into account these longer-run trends in savings and investment when
setting short-run interest rates, along with cyclical influences like changes in government spending,
uncertainty and financial conditions. If desired investment falls persistently, for example, persistently lower
policy rates are necessary to offset disinflationary pressure, all else equal.
With short-term interest rates felt to be at their lower bounds, since 2009 many central banks have turned to
alternative, ‘unconventional policies’ to reduce longer-term interest rates, or prevent them from rising. These
include quantitative easing and forward guidance about future interest rates. However, when long rates are
already very low as they are now, and markets are functioning smoothly, my view is that it is difficult to
reduce long rates any further, so there is little further stimulus to be gained from these tools.17 Of course,
other MPC members may take different views on these tools and how their effectiveness varies over time. I
believe that quantitative easing is important in the event of market dysfunction, for example, but also that its
power mainly lies in helping offset the disruption, rather than providing net additional stimulus to the
economy.
16

See Vlieghe (2016) for an elaboration of these points.
The key constraint is that long rates depend partly on market expectations of future policy interest rates. Hence, if markets think that
policy rates have a lower bound, then long rates are also likely to be bounded. Introducing negative policy rates would relax this
constraint.

Many of the structural factors that have reduced interest rates are likely to persist. For example,
demographic trends will not reverse for some time.18 And though I have been optimistic about future
productivity growth, there has been little to suggest that it will recover to rates above 2%, seen in the thirty
years to 2007.19 Finally, though the global rollout of a Covid vaccine should gradually lower risks to
individuals and businesses, perceptions of tail risks – perhaps over future pandemics – are likely to remain
heightened.20 Moreover, growing risks associated with climate change might add downward pressure to
risk-free interest rates.21 I therefore think it is crucial that the MPC has in its toolkit other policies that are able
to effectively boost spending and inflation when needed.

Are negative rates effective? International experience

The debate on negative rates should hinge on whether and under what conditions they are an effective
policy tool. To answer these questions, we must turn to the experience of advanced economies which have
actually implemented negative interest rate policy (NIRP): Denmark (from 2012), the Euro Area (from 2014),
Switzerland (from 2014), Sweden (from 2015-2019) and Japan (from 2016).22 My reading of the literature is
that:


Financial-market channels appear to be unimpeded under negative rates, and some may even be
stronger than usual.



While pass-through to household deposit rates can be constrained near zero, pass-through appears
to be less constrained for corporate deposit rates, which may stimulate spending by firms.



There is strong evidence of transmission into looser bank lending conditions, even if this is
somewhat constrained relative to ‘normal’.



There is no clear evidence that negative rates have reduced bank profits overall, and a number of
studies find positive impacts, once you take into account the boost to the economy.



Taking these points together, the evidence suggests that negative rates can provide significant
stimulus.

18

Indeed, Schmelzing (2020) argues that over several centuries one can observe a gradual ‘suprasecular’ decline in global real interest
rates of around 1-2 basis points per annum. In a contrasting view, Goodhart and Pradhan (2020) argue that a ‘great demographic
reversal’ in the coming years will lead to upward pressure on inflation, nominal and real interest rates, for example as the share of the
population of working age falls back.
19
See Tenreyro (2018) for a previous discussion of my views on productivity growth.
20
See Vlieghe (2017) for a discussion of the effect of risk on real interest rates.
21
Climate change risks might also encourage new investments in green technology, which could limit the impact on the risk-free rate.
22
In most cases these dates correspond to the announcement of the first cut below zero for the interest rate on deposits/excess
reserves held at the central bank – the rate around which interbank lending rates have tended to coalesce in the post-GFC environment
of substantial central bank liquidity provision. For Sweden the dates correspond to the repo rate.

I will now set out the evidence supporting these conclusions. (The casual reader may wish to skip the
remainder of this section.)

Evidence from the literature

I will first examine the financial-market channels of

some corporate bonds. Of course, other factors are

at play here, including the structural forces described
earlier. But empirical studies which attempt to strip

out other factors have found that cuts in policy rates
into negative territory, if anything, may have a
greater effect on longer-term yields than normal.24
And other studies reached a similar conclusion for

the impact on exchange rates and equities.25
This is perhaps unsurprising: there is no obvious reason why these channels would be impaired; the main
questions about negative rates have related to banking sector channels. But financial-market channels are
important and should not be overlooked. For example, estimates from the Bank’s suite of models suggest
that financial market channels - operating via the exchange rate, firms’ cost of capital and households’
financial wealth – account for a third to two thirds of the total medium-term impact on output from Bank Rate
changes, and a half to three quarters of the impact on inflation.26
Turning to the banking sector, I’ll first examine pass-through of policy rates to deposit rates.
When deposit rates are well above 0% at the time when negative rates are implemented, pass-through of
policy rate cuts can be material.27 But several studies document that, rather than shifting smoothly into

23

For example, see Arteta et al (2016).
See Bräuning and Wu (2017) and Rostagno et al (2019). Grisse et al (2017) find evidence that transmission of rate cuts to
international long rates is stronger the closer the proximity to the perceived lower bound, perhaps due to signalling to traders that the
floor on policy rates is lower than they previously thought.
25
Bräuning and Wu (2017), results of Gräb and Mehl (2015) cited in Eisenschmidt and Smets (2019).
26
The range here reflects differences in how persistent the change in Bank Rate is perceived to be: the more persistent the expected
change, the greater the role of the forward-looking financial market channels.
27
A box in the August 2016 Inflation Report documents a positive relationship between the starting level of deposit rates for new
business and the pass-through of reference rates in a number of European economies over 2013-16. Eggertsson et al (2019) finds a
similar result for the average rate on Swedish deposits, while Hong and Kandrac (2018) note that Japanese retail deposit rates were
very low prior to the introduction of NIRP, resulting in less scope for pass-through. Klein (2020) finds no evidence of a slowdown of
pass-through to deposit rates in the Euro Area over the 2014-18 period overall, but notes that pass-through appears to stall after 2017
as deposit rates approached zero. Bittner et al (2020) finds that deposit rate pass-through under NIRP was stronger in Euro Area
countries with higher starting levels of deposit rates.

negative territory, the distribution of deposit rates instead ‘piles up’ close to zero, such that pass-through of
policy rate cuts is reduced.28 The extent of the constraint varies across depositors. As Chart 6 shows,
average household deposit rates appear to have been bounded below by zero. And within the distribution,
the share of household deposits receiving negative rates is very small, albeit increasing.29
In contrast, corporate deposit rates in Denmark and some Euro Area countries have fallen below zero
(Chart 6), with negative rates more likely to be imposed on larger corporates.30 Banks’ decision to ‘go
negative’ also seems to depend on the size and expected persistence of negative policy rates. There was
little pass-through to Euro Area corporate deposits at first, but pass-through increased when policy rates
went deeper into negative territory.31
And the modestly negative rates seen on some deposits have not caused demand for cash to spike,
suggesting that the old textbook model has been superseded.32

Incomplete pass-through to deposit rates has limited direct consequence for households’ saving and
spending decisions. A fall in deposit rates normally has a modest effect on spending, since while it
encourages the depositor to bring forward spending rather than save, it also reduces her income, which
pushes in the other direction.33 Some new studies suggest that for firms, negative rates on corporate
deposits have even led firms to increase investment and employment.34 Interestingly, they find that charging
firms for depositing money prompts a stronger response than changing the (positive) level of interest those
deposits return. This suggests one aspect of the banking channel of negative rates which could be more
powerful than usual.
A theoretical paper by Brunnermeier and Koby (2018) has hypothesised that reduced pass-through to
deposit rates could squeeze banks’ profits and cause a contraction in credit supply.35 Bank profits could fall if
the return on their assets – for example central bank reserves36 – fell by more than the interest paid on their
liabilities, which include deposits. In turn, this could affect banks’ willingness or ability to extend credit.
In my opinion an outright contraction in credit supply in response to negative rates is a remote possibility.
Since bank funding costs overall should fall – given the presence of significant amounts of non-deposit
funding, for example – this should create space for banks to reduce loan rates somewhat (and hence boost
credit supply) while preserving their margins. Competitive pressures may lead banks to cut loan rates by
more than this, which in turn could reduce bank profits, but this would be consistent with stronger credit
supply and more stimulus being provided. I would find it highly unlikely that we would see any combination
where banks would simultaneously reduce their loan rates substantially – such that their profits fell materially
– while also reducing the supply of credit. More importantly, there is actually strong evidence that
negative rates lead to looser bank lending conditions, even if some studies find that the transmission
is somewhat constrained relative to ‘normal’.
In aggregate, loan rates for households and corporates in different countries have generally fallen since the
introduction of negative interest rates (Chart 7).37 While there were many factors affecting loan rates over
this period, the aggregate data suggests that negative rates succeeded in loosening bank lending conditions.
To examine this more precisely, I turn to the literature.

33
These opposing income and substitution effects are present in the standard heterogeneous agent model of Kaplan et al (2014) for
example.
34
See Altavilla et al (2019) on the Euro Area, and Abildgren and Kuchler (2020) on Denmark.
35
When policy rates go below a certain level, lower profits reduce banks’ capital, which in turn constrains bank lending. This mechanism
features in the model of Eggertsson et al (2019) also.
36
Though central bank reserves tend to comprise a relatively small share of banks’ total assets – e.g. see Chart 8 below - and several
countries have restricted the proportion of reserves that are subject to negative rates.
37
One counterexample is Switzerland, where certain mortgage rates rose after the introduction of negative rates. We shouldn’t
overweight this, though, since a tightening in macroprudential policy may have contributed to the rise, and lending rates fell back later.

Several euro area studies have found that negative rates lowered loan rates and stimulated credit growth.38
There is debate over the extent: for example, some found normal levels of pass-through39 while others find
some pass-through but less than normal. 40 All results demonstrate that there is stimulus through the banking
sector.41 For Sweden, studies agree that the Riksbank’s initial cuts into negative territory were passed
through to mortgage rates, but disagree on the extent of pass-through of subsequent rate cuts.42
One identification challenge is that negative rates were implemented to combat disinflationary shocks, and it
is difficult to control for the impact of these shocks in empirical studies.43 That might suggest putting more
weight on certain countries’ experience. For example, negative rates were implemented in Denmark to stem
upward pressure on the exchange rate, in keeping with the DNB’s fixed exchange rate target. Since the
shock was largely external to Denmark44 the Danish experience is more of a ‘natural experiment’ that can
better support causal claims. In Denmark, pass-through has been positive, providing stimulus to the
economy, although slower than ‘normal’.45
Another approach, carried out in a recent paper by Ulate (2021), uses a global sample of data, which allows
the author to use countries with low but positive policy rates as a control group. It finds significant
pass-through for loan rates even as deposit rate pass-through was constrained.46
The most popular method has been to compare outcomes for banks that are more ‘exposed’ to negative
rates relative to others. For example, several studies have used a bank’s reliance on deposits as a proxy for
exposure. By comparing across banks, authors have a better chance of making causal claims about the
impact of negative rates on bank behaviour, although the aggregate implications can be harder to interpret.
As the green entries in Table 1 show, many studies have concluded that more exposed banks had stronger
credit supply responses than others, both in terms of a greater quantity of lending, and by lending to riskier
borrowers. The latter finding suggests that the stimulus provided may be similar to the ‘risk-taking channel’ of
monetary policy also proposed at positive rates.47 In my view, these results are striking, and strongly refute
the concerns around banking sector transmission. Other studies (shown in grey) find little difference across
38

In this context, credit growth is being used as a summary statistic. If negative rates were found to have less of an impact on aggregate
credit growth than ‘usual’ that might suggest that some combination of lower loan rate pass-through, less loosening of non-price terms,
or less of a response of borrower demand to easier borrowing conditions, though some studies do attempt to control for the latter.
39
Eisenschmidt and Smets (2019) and Horvath et al (2018). Klein (2020) found a larger impact on loan rates relative to normal, while
Bräuning and Wu (2017) found a larger impact on loan rates and credit growth at longer maturities.
40
Altavilla et al (2019) found loan rate pass-through to be significant though constrained, though their focus is on deposit rates.
41
And the banks themselves agree. As reported in Boucinha and Burlon (2020), a net balance of respondents to the ECB’s Bank
Lending Survey also report that in absolute terms NIRP resulted in higher credit growth and, particularly, lower loan rates.
42
See Eggertsson and Summers (2019) and Erikson and Vestin (2019). The debate centres around whether to attribute falls in effective
mortgage rates between 2016H2-2018 to lagged pass-through of the cuts in the repo rate in 2015H2-2016H1.
43
This would bias studies against finding a boost from bank-lending channels.
44
For example, you might think that disinflationary shocks in the Euro Area would have little effect on Danish loan rates.
45
See Adolfsen and Spange (2020). One complication is that the structure of the Danish banking system is different to the UK –
differences across countries are discussed in the next section.
46
In a recent blogpost, Beauregard and Spiegel (2020) use a similar approach and find that credit growth was significantly stronger in
NIRP countries after one year, but weaker after two to three years

banks, which provides little reason to believe transmission is constrained. The picture is not completely
uniform. A small number of studies (shown in red) find that more exposed banks are likely to have had a
weaker credit supply response than others, at least along certain margins. Although even if more exposed
banks do cut loan rates by slightly less, for example, it does not follow that aggregate pass-through is zero.
Finally, some studies examine the impact on bank profits. As mentioned earlier, bank profits do not need to
rise in order for negative rates to provide stimulus. Indeed, a reduction in banks’ net interest income – the
difference between the interest banks earn on their assets and pay out on their liabilities - is likely to signify
strong pass-through to loan rates, which should boost spending. However, a sharp deterioration in bank
profits could conceivably affect financial stability, or cause credit supply to tighten later on.
There is little clear evidence that negative rates have reduced bank profits overall,48 49 and a number of
studies find positive impacts,50 once you take into account the boost to the economy provided by the
stimulus.51 Banks’ profits come from a range of sources, each of which may be affected differently by
negative rates. On the one hand, several studies find that one such component - banks’ net interest income tends to fall when policy rates go negative.52 That said, some find that even that hit is partially mitigated by
lower non-deposit funding costs and stronger credit volumes, while increases in risk-taking may also have
helped. Most importantly, the fall in banks’ net interest income tends to be offset elsewhere, for example by
reduced loan losses, which is in turn consistent with looser monetary policy boosting the economy and
raising borrowers’ incomes.53 When taken together, the evidence here suggests that banks overall are not
harmed by negative rates, while the economy benefits.
The way negative rates were implemented may also have helped banks to maintain profitability. For
example, in many cases some portion of banks’ reserves was exempted from negative rates, also known as
“tiering” (though this did not happen in the Euro Area until 2019), while the ECB’s TLTRO (similar to the
Bank’s Term Funding Scheme) helped lower bank funding costs.54

See Strasky & Hwang (2019) for the Euro Area, Hong & Kandrac (2018) for Japan and Lopez et al (2020) for a global sample. In a
recent blog, Beauregard and Spiegel (2020) find little impact on profits initially, but a negative impact on profits after a few years, using a
global sample of banks – however, these results do not control for local economic conditions.
50
See Rostagno et al (2019) for the Euro Area, and Basten & Mariathasan (2018) for Switzerland.
51
A number of other studies have investigated the impact of low interest rates, but not specifically negative rates. For example, while
Borio et al (2017) find that low interest rates reduce bank profits, Claessens et al (2018) find no significant effect on profitability overall,
although the effects appear to become more negative over time. Altavilla, Boucinha and Peydró (2018) find that lower rates are broadly
neutral for total bank profits after controlling for expected future economic conditions, while a prolonged period of low rates does have a
direct negative effect on profits but this is counterbalanced by improved macroeconomic conditions.
52
In addition to the papers looking at overall profitability, Klein (2020) focuses specifically on net interest margins and finds a negative
effect from NIRP. The picture on net interest income is not uniform, however, with Basten & Mariathasan (2018) and Tan (2019) finding
positive and insignificant effects, respectively, for banks more exposed to negative rates.
53
Another channel emphasised in the theoretical literature is capital gains on security holdings resulting from lower policy rates – though
this will only flow through to banks’ accounting profits if securities are marked to market which tends to be the case only for a minority
(Altavilla, Boucinha and Peydró 2018).
54
See Saunders (2020) for more discussion of these options.

Interestingly, a number of studies55 – though not all56 – find that bank equities tend to fall after policy rate
cuts below zero are announced. That seems at odds with the more sanguine results on bank profitability.
One interpretation is that financial markets initially focussed on net interest income, but did not initially
account for the indirect boost to profits from negative rates arising from improvements in other sources of
income. Weakness in bank equity prices after the initial implementation of negative rates could also reflect
an adjustment to a weaker economic outlook, if central banks were perceived to have better information
about the state of the economy, and negative rates were seen to signal a particularly large deterioration.57

55

For example, Ampudia and van den Heuvel (2019) and Bats et al (2020) find that Euro Area bank equity prices have tended to fall in
response to surprise reductions in short rates under NIRP, which wasn’t the case when interest rates were higher. Hong and Kandrac
(2018) show that bank equity prices fell materially upon the announcement of NIRP in Japan, which they argue was largely unexpected.
And Eggertsson et al (2019) find that Swedish bank equities tended to underperform relative to the broader stock market on the days of
negative rate announcements.
56
Altavilla et al (2018) find that falls in short rates and flattening of the yield curve led to higher bank equity prices on the days when
unconventional policy measures were announced, including but not limited to NIRP.
57
See, for example, Romer and Romer (2000) or Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) for evidence of the presence of central-bank
information effects.

What other factors might influence how negative rates work?

While we now have a considerable body of evidence on negative rates from other countries, this is
nevertheless drawn from a relatively small number of experiences compared to changes at positive policy
rates. Hence, as it does for all policies, the MPC has discussed various factors that might affect the
transmission of negative rates, were they to be implemented here. The MPC set out its collective view on
some of these factors in the August 2020 Monetary Policy Report. In this section I will set out my own
perspective.
There are many reasons why monetary policy transmission (or policy multipliers) can vary across countries
and over time. These differences apply to varying extents to all policies. For example, last year
Governor Bailey discussed why the effects of quantitative easing were likely to depend on the circumstances
under which it was used.58 And I have previously highlighted that in the UK interest rates affect inflation more
quickly than in the past.59 So it would not be surprising if some features of the UK economy, at a given point
in time, might influence exactly how negative rates operate here.
Potentially relevant features include the composition of bank balance sheets; differences in openness across
economies; the size and composition of household debt, and the quantitative relevance of market-based
finance in the economy. Importantly, many of these features are not fixed – they can vary over time,
including in response to policy changes.
Most of these differences also affect policy transmission at positive rates. For example, the UK is a relatively
small and open economy, so one would expect the exchange-rate effects of monetary policy to be stronger
than in larger, less open economies such as Japan, but weaker than in Switzerland, for example. Compared
to the euro area, the UK CPI basket is more import intensive, which would lead to a greater direct impact of
exchange-rate changes on inflation, all else equal.60 And UK corporates use a relatively large share of bond
market financing, suggesting that the cost-of-capital channel may be more powerful in the UK.61
Another difference is that UK households have more debt, and a larger share of floating-rate and
shorter-term fixed-rate mortgages, compared with much of Europe62 (Chart 8). On the one hand, this would
suggest a stronger ‘cash flow’ channel of monetary policy in the UK, with more borrowers benefitting

58

See Bailey (2020) and Bailey et al (2020), who echoed Vlieghe (2018).
See Tenreyro (2019), Cloyne and Hürtgen (2016) and Cesa-Bianchi et al (2020).
60
Differences in economies’ size may also be important, if exporters in a smaller economy are likely to have less market power over
prices on the global market, such that more of the adjustment from a move in the exchange rate will come via volumes rather than
prices. See Broadbent (2017) for a broader discussion of the adjustment of UK exporters to the exchange rate.
61
As of 2019, debt securities comprised 8% of total corporate (PNFC) liabilities in the UK, compared to 4% for corporates (NFC) in the
Euro Area, for example.
62
In 2019, the UK household debt to GDP ratio was 84%, compared to 58% in the Euro Area. And as of 2020 Q3, floating rate and
fixed-rate mortgages of five years of less together comprised 98% of the outstanding stock and 98% of the flow of new business in the
UK, compared to 24% of the flow in the Euro Area (stocks data not published).

relatively quickly when interest rates are cut.63 On the other hand, the sizeable share of outstanding
mortgages on floating rates could mean some of the costs to banks’ net interest income are more
front-loaded than the benefits.
Other cross-country differences may be relevant only at negative or near-zero interest rates.64 The largest
UK banks currently fund more of their household and small business lending with household deposits than
do banks in some other countries, including the euro area (Chart 8). The level of deposit rates at the time of
cutting to negative rates has also differed across countries, and within countries compared to later cuts.65 If
other funding costs were to fall in line with Bank Rate, but as in Europe, banks did not cut household deposit
rates below zero, then this could lead to differences in transmission. All else equal, a larger share of
household deposit funding would require that to maintain unchanged net interest income, banks would also
have to cut lending rates by slightly less.66 With an increase in aggregate (and loan) demand and lower
impairments from a stronger macroeconomic outlook, this could still imply a boost to bank profitability,
relative to the counterfactual of no policy change. If banks chose to pass-through less of the cut, this would
suggest a little less stimulus via the banking sector.
The effects of such cross-country differences in transmission are difficult to estimate precisely, both because
they depend on prevailing balance sheets at the time, and crucially, on how the banking system adapts in
response. As an example of how balance sheets can change, UK banks have markedly increased their
share of retail funding since the 2008 financial crisis.67 More recently, they have also substituted away from
more expensive time deposits into sight deposits such as current accounts. If the introduction of negative
rates changed the relative costs of different sources of funding, banks may be able to adjust their funding mix
or maturity over time in a way that maximised profitability, subject to ring-fencing and other prudential
requirements on banks to maintain stable funding bases.
Banks have also used other strategies in the past and in other countries to maintain profitability, which they
could potentially turn to again, although perhaps only if negative rates had to be used more often in future.
For example, some UK banks have charged fees on some of their deposit accounts for several years –
Chart 9 shows the interest-rate equivalent of these fees has varied over time. In Denmark, which has
experienced negative rates for several years, some banks have chosen to set a modest negative rate on
larger deposits. Given the skewed distribution of household deposit holdings in the UK, even charging

63

For example, see Calza et al (2013).
Ramsden (2020) also highlights some of these differences.
65
The current level of sight deposit rates in the UK is lower than it was in the euro area when negative rates were first implemented
there, although more similar for the most recent cut. It is higher than it was for later cuts, and it is higher than in some other countries
when negative rates were introduced.
66
As pointed out in the August 2020 Monetary Policy Report, smaller banks and building societies are generally most exposed to this
risk in the UK. See Saunders (2020) for more discussion on how banks might choose to react.
67
The introduction of ring-fencing for the largest UK banks has also increased the share of deposits used to fund household and small
business lending. Chavaz and Elliot (2020) estimate that this has reduced the cost of credit for households, which in turn increased risk
taking by some smaller banks.

negative rates on only a small proportion of accounts with large deposits above a certain value could enable
banks to significantly reduce their funding costs.
In all, there are many ways banks might respond to further cuts in policy rates other than limiting
pass-through to lending rates. And even if they opted not to fully pass on cuts to lending rates at first, this
would only offset part of the stimulus from lending channels, and would leave the rest of the transmission
mechanism unaffected.

More generally, the effects of any monetary policy are likely to depend on the cyclical conditions at the time
the policy is introduced. My own research has found that US monetary policy is less powerful during
recessions, when it is needed most, than during upswings.68 But with few experiences to go on, there is little
evidence about the presence or otherwise of these effects for negative policy rates.
One factor is that banks’ balance-sheet positions also vary over the cycle, which could potentially interact
with negative interest rates. Banks are likely to be in a somewhat weaker position over the next few years
due to the Covid-induced downturn. At the same time, the UK banking sector went into the Covid crisis
having increased capital ratios markedly over the past decade, in large part in response to actions taken by
the Bank’s FPC and PRC.
To think through the potential effects, one can compare the effects of negative rates on banks with different
initial financial positions. Some studies have found that in Europe, banks with weaker financial positions were

more likely to restrict pass-through to deposit rates69 or tighten some non-interest terms,70 in response to
negative rates. But others obtained opposing71 or inconclusive72 results.
We may also be able to learn from recent experience of interest rate policy in the UK. Although there are no
past examples of negative policy rates, the MPC voted in March 2020 to cut Bank Rate from 0.75% to 0.1%.
Since there is no clear discontinuity at zero in the demand for cash, and since deposit rates facing
households are typically lower than the policy rate itself, then any differences in transmission at negative
rates should also be somewhat evident at low, positive policy rates.
My reading is that the cut in Bank Rate has so far worked as expected. The financial-market channels of
policy appear to be operating normally. And there has been significant pass-through to a range of
commercial bank interest rates (Chart 10). These include rates on existing variable-rate mortgages, on new
corporate loans, and on deposits.73 The rates on new fixed-rate mortgages at low (60%) loan-to-value (LTV)
rates have ended the year broadly flat, though these are less directly linked to Bank Rate, and had already
fallen around 30 basis points over 2019. Very strong demand for new mortgages, coupled with difficulties
processing high volumes of business, have also pushed up on these rates this year.74 (Chart 11 shows the
sharp increase in house-purchase approvals, boosted by the temporary stamp-duty holiday and pent-up
demand following lockdown, which have triggered a thick-market effect.75) Consistent with that, low LTV
mortgage rates rose slightly after the first lockdown ended, before falling back recently.

Monetary policy has also been anticipating and acting against a Covid-related tightening in credit conditions
for high LTV borrowers (i.e. with smaller housing deposits). These products provide lenders with less
collateral, putting them at greater risk of losses. With uncertainty over the outlook for house prices, and a risk
of more mortgage defaults as unemployment rises, lenders’ perceptions of likely losses on these loans have
increased, leading them to increase rates sharply or withdraw products entirely (Chart 11). But absent looser
policy, and the associated boost to incomes and employment, credit conditions would likely have tightened
even more for these borrowers.
My overall assessment is that, while we can never have complete certainty, negative interest rates
should with high likelihood boost UK growth and inflation. Cutting Bank Rate to its record low of 0.1%
has helped loosen lending conditions relative to the counterfactual (of no policy change), and I believe
further cuts would continue to provide stimulus. It is possible that bank-lending channels impart slightly less
stimulus relative to experiences in other countries, at least initially, but I would consider it as very unlikely
that we do not see any boost to lending. There are also several ways in which banks would be able to adapt
to mitigate any hit to net interest income, while overall profitability would be supported by the boost to
demand and the associated falls in provisions, relative to the counterfactual of no policy stimulus. There is
little reason to suspect that the financial-market channels of monetary policy, which our models suggest are
quantitatively important, would operate differently to normal.

Economic outlook

As in 2020, the economic outlook for the UK in 2021 will depend overwhelmingly on the path of the Covid-19
pandemic, both at home and abroad. Since the last MPC forecast (published in early November), we have
had positive news on vaccines, which has been tempered by the intensification of the current wave of Covid.
Altogether, this will imply a worse near-term outlook than anticipated in November, before the economy
starts a now less uncertain recovery later in 2021. Both the speed and the extent of the recovery will hinge
crucially on how households, businesses and economic policy respond to the continued effects of the virus.
The latest manifestation of the virus’s economic effects is the renewed national lockdown brought in last
week in England, with similar measures also in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The precise
path of output over 2020 Q4 and 2021 Q1 will be determined by the timing and extent of these lockdown
measures. We will see headline-grabbing negative growth numbers, followed by large positive ones when
the economy is able to reopen. Crucial for jobs, incomes and inflation will be the level of output we recover to
later in the year, rather than the changes in the interim.
After current restrictions are relaxed, the speed and the extent of the output recovery will depend on how
vaccine rollout and other public health policies affect the pandemic, and on how the behaviour of households
and companies responds to those developments. As high-risk groups are vaccinated and mortality falls,

there is likely to be a reduction in voluntary and mandated social distancing, which will help consumption
recover some way towards its pre-Covid level. But there are factors that will act to slow and limit any
recovery, which policy must take into account.
First and foremost, until vaccination is widespread across the population at home and abroad, there is likely
to be a limit to how far activity can recover in some sectors. Spending in high social-contact sectors is likely
to continue to increase virus prevalence, particularly given the more transmissible new strain. Moreover,
even if the UK continues to vaccinate more quickly than most countries, slower rollout in any of our trading
partners will weigh on activity here, especially in sectors such as tourism.
Further ahead, even as fear of the virus subsides, the differing effects it has had across different parts of the
economy will constrain spending. Some households have built up a large stock of enforced savings during
lockdowns, when they couldn’t spend on services such as hospitality. While this will create some pent-up
demand, it is likely to be released only gradually – consuming many of these services requires time – limiting
the speed of any rebound. And many other households, often low-income to start with, have suffered falls in
income through unemployment or lower working hours, which will translate into lower spending. Many more
households, as well as businesses, may choose to maintain a higher buffer of savings in future or pay down
debt, while job and revenue uncertainty persists.
Adding to the uncertainty, structural changes to the way we consume and work may be partly here to stay.
Consumers have learnt that many goods and services can be purchased as easily online. Workers and firms
have learnt that commutes and rental costs can be efficiently reduced with more remote working. With fewer
days of office work, transport and complementary consumption will fall and, with them, employment in those
activities will also fall. The speed of labour reallocation, and the extent of business failures, will play crucial
roles in determining how much these effects spill over into other sectors, higher unemployment and weaker
aggregate demand.

So far, fiscal policy, especially the government’s Job Retention Scheme, has helped to prevent a much larger
increase in unemployment. The successful development of vaccines should also have given many badly
affected firms confidence in their viability, since where demand substitution and business closures are
temporary, demand should at some point be able to return. But the labour market has nonetheless loosened
significantly.76 In addition, the resurgence in the virus and related downturns are likely to mean significantly
more job losses still to come. For some sectors, despite fiscal support schemes, the cumulative revenue loss
is likely to lead to business failures.

76

The official unemployment rate had risen to 4.9% in October, ahead of the second national lockdown, and measurement difficulties
mean these data were likely to be understating its true rate. Separate HRMC data were consistent with unemployment already being
above 6%.

While fiscal policy is the main actor in this crisis, monetary policy also has a role to play in supporting the
economy, consistent with our mandate. In the near-term, it can stimulate demand in sectors still able to
operate during the lockdown; support cash flow and help keep borrowing costs low for businesses and
households. These effects should help limit insolvencies and job losses, reducing scarring to the economy’s
potential output in future.
The policy measures that limit scarring are also essential to bring inflation back to target. At present we have
a very large degree of spare capacity, so there is no short term trade-off between our objectives. As the
vaccine is rolled out, we will see some pick-up in demand, which should use up some capacity and reduce
the disinflationary pressures from the pandemic. But even as we recover ground, we should not forget that
disinflationary pressures predated Covid – core inflation has now been below 2% for 27 consecutive months,
and for 80% of the past seven years.
Importantly, in my view, the speed with which we eliminate spare capacity, and the scale of the rise in
unemployment, will depend on policy. All else equal, looser monetary policy can help the economy recover
faster, bringing inflation back to target, while also preventing some of the job losses and business failures
that could otherwise reduce potential output in future. The MPC has given guidance that policy will not be
tightened before there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity
and achieving the inflation target sustainably. It is possible that more stimulus be needed to do so at an
appropriate pace. If that is the case, having negative rates in our toolbox will, in my view, be important.
