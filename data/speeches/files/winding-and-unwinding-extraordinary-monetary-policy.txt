Introduction
If cities competed for the title of the birth place of economics then Edinburgh would be one of the favourites.
Hume and Smith would be contenders for individual medals. But such is the low popular standing of
economics I rather doubt that there is much enthusiasm for handing out medals right now. This is not hard to
understand: we have been through a near total collapse of the financial system followed by one of the
deepest and longest recessions in history. I use “we” to include most of the western, rich world. Very few
economists predicted this – though some warned about excesses in parts of the financial system and
imbalances that might cause problems.
But I am not going to apologise for the supposed failings of economics. In fact I am honoured to be asked to
deliver the Scottish Economic Society Annual Lecture. I am going to talk about monetary policy and how it
has been operated in the extraordinary – and I mean extraordinary in a bad way – environment of the past
5 years. I will assess whether some alternative policies might be more effective. I will also consider how we
might get back to a more normal setting for monetary policy and whether we need to rethink the aims and
tools of policy.
Before I get to that let me take one and a half minutes to say why I don’t feel inclined to devote time to
apologising for the failings of economics. One reason is that the value of economics should not be gauged
by how well economists can forecast the future. It is unfortunate then that many people are encouraged to
think that this is pretty much the only yardstick to use. I think if you judged modern medicine by the same
criterion you would not think it very valuable. But of course we don’t do that. We believe doctors are worth
listening to if we have a broken leg or have a brain tumour even though they may not have been able to
predict that you would be in that unfortunate position. A second and stronger reason not to spend time
apologising for economics is that one of the main criticisms made of it is so spectacularly wrong-headed that
it should not be taken seriously. This is the criticism that economists became convinced that the actions of
rational economic agents in shaping market outcomes would inevitably lead to stable and efficient outcomes.
According to this criticism, since we have plainly not had stable and efficient outcomes over the past 5 years,
then it would seem to follow that the guiding principles of economics are deeply flawed. Those who think
they are presenting a sophisticated version of this critique will specifically mention the rational expectations
and efficient markets hypotheses. In fact all the efficient markets hypothesis really says is that financial
outcomes are pretty much unpredictable – not that they are desirable or efficient in the everyday meaning of
that term. And the rational expectations hypothesis is really a way of thinking that stresses the importance of
people’s anticipation of future events in driving their decisions; it in no way means that the collective
implications of such decisions must be optimal. In fact any undergraduate economics textbook spends a lot
of time showing why market outcomes can be – and often are – sub-optimal. Economic thinking at the
frontier of the subject has – for at least thirty years – stressed that a combination of rational behaviour by

individuals and interaction between people in markets where there are information problems creates the
potential for outcomes that are not at all likely to be optimal.
One indication of the dominance of this type of thinking – a type of thinking completely at odds with the
caricature that economists claim that free market outcomes are stable and efficient – is the list of economists
who have won Nobel prizes. The largest group of people on that list won their prizes for work which showed
that market outcomes could often be inefficient and sometimes unstable1. See Annex 1.
I find economic thinking very helpful in trying to understand why we have got into such a mess and, more
importantly, how we might get out of it. Tonight I want to describe the part that monetary policy is playing,
consider whether alternative policies might be more effective and explore some of the longer-term
consequences of what we are still going through. I start by describing how policy has evolved over the past
5 years. Then I will assess whether monetary policy has stopped being effective and if a more radical step –
explicit monetisation of government spending – is required. Finally I consider what the lessons from this
extraordinary period are for the design of policy and assess how, in due course, the transition back to a more
normal monetary policy might be made.
Monetary policy during the crisis
Monetary policy has been trying to offset extraordinary recessionary forces that arose in the wake of a near
collapse of the banking system of the western world.
The measures that have been taken to counter the extraordinary forces at play have themselves been
extraordinary. In the UK Bank Rate was lowered rapidly, from 5.75% in December 2007 to 0.5% in
March 2009. Even with Bank Rate at 0.5%, it looked like demand would be so weak that the economy would
descend further so that inflation might undershoot its target in the medium term.
Reducing Bank Rate further would have had the advantage of using an established instrument to implement
monetary policy. But lowering Bank Rate would also have had disadvantages. First, it is not clear whether it
would have substantially eased the supply of credit at those longer maturities that matter for consumption
and investment. And second, it may have adversely affected the stability of a number of banks and building
societies, whose profit margins were already squeezed: their interest income had fallen much more than their
funding costs because they had a considerable stock of mortgages with interest rates contractually linked to
Bank Rate, not to their own funding costs. I think there were reasons to believe that the benefits of cutting

In the annex I provide a list of winners and an (admittedly subjective) allocation of them to one of three groups: 1. Those for whom
incomplete markets, or asymmetric information, or moral hazard-adverse selection, or externalities, or coordination problems are central
(eg Akerlof, Mirrlees, Spence, Stiglitz): 2. Those for whom those issues are not very relevant (eg the econometricians – Engle,
Heckman, McFadden, Granger): 3. Those for whom even though information issues are central, the laissez faire outcomes are still likely
to be the best realistically available (eg Friedman, Lucas, Prescott, Coase). The first of these three groups is significantly larger than the
other two; I would put almost half of the winners in it (see Annex).

obvious reason to think things are much different today, though this is something to keep monitoring.

(a) Depicted are the Bank’s respective key rates over time: bank rate, minimum lending rate, minimum band 1 dealing rate, repo rate,
and official Bank Rate.

With Bank Rate at 0.5% monetary policy has been further loosened through two other routes.
First, the MPC embarked on asset purchases, aiming to increase the availability, and cut the cost, of funding
(via equity or bond issuance or by other borrowing) for the private sector. One means would have been to
purchase directly large quantities of private sector assets. This is what the Federal Reserve System did
when purchasing mortgage-backed securities (though in fact most of such assets had the backing of
government agencies which made them closer to government bonds than private sector assets). The MPC
has instead decided that its – now enormous – asset purchases should be overwhelmingly of government
bonds2. The people that sell those bonds to the Bank then have to decide which alternative assets to
acquire – these could either be claims on UK private sector entities (eg claims on UK companies that have
issued bonds or equities or deposit claims on banks) or claims on foreign entities (by acquiring foreign
equities or bonds or other debt claims issued by overseas companies and governments). The MPC has
taken the indirect route of buying gilts and then letting the sellers make the portfolio allocation decisions that
2

The Bank has purchased some private sector assets (corporate bonds and commercial paper), aiming to improve the liquidity in, and
flow of, corporate credit; but the amounts have been small compared to purchases of gilts. As of 23 August 2012, the Bank’s asset
purchase portfolio contained £346bn in gilts, £91mn in corporate bonds, and no commercial paper. The bank is still operating (as buyer
and seller) in the corporate bond market.

mean that the funds they get from the Bank are channelled into other places. It seems highly likely to me
that many of those funds have been channelled into the UK corporate bond and equity markets3. Some of
the money has certainly gone towards buying claims on overseas assets – in which case that is likely to have
an exchange rate impact as well as having effects on the domestic economy as the sterling is recycled.
Some of the money flows directly to banks and stays with them – potentially helping with bank funding and
liquidity problems that have at many times over the past few years been acute.
One can argue about how effective all this has been in offsetting the recessionary impact of the financial
crisis. But let me note in passing that one thing one cannot do is to take as proof of its ineffectiveness the
fact that reserves held by banks at the Bank of England have gone up enormously. It is a mistake to see that
as proof that somehow the money created by QE has got “trapped” in the banking sector and is doing no
good. Creating reserves (that is commercial bank deposits at the Bank of England) is how the Bank of
England finances its asset purchases. So it is not surprising that banks’ reserve balances increased by a lot
(Figure 2) – it is simply a matter of arithmetic.

(a) Weekly data, up to 22 August 2012.
(b) ‘Asset purchases’ is the quantity of asset purchased by the creation of central bank reserves by the Bank’s asset purchase facility
(APF); these are reflected by a loan to the APF on the Bank’s balance sheet.

The money is going to come to sit at the Bank as reserves even if by its creation it has triggered multiple
other transactions that have helped finance spending in the economy. This point is not well understood so
let me take one minute to illustrate it.
Suppose the Bank of England buys an extra £1 million of gilts; the seller effectively gets a cheque drawn on
the central bank. That cheque is cashed and so the bank of the seller of the gilt credits the seller’s account
and the cheque is presented to the Bank of England who credits the account of the commercial bank. So
bank deposits are higher as are reserves held by banks at the Bank of England. Suppose the seller of the
gilt now buys a newly created corporate bond that will finance some new investment. The bank account of
the company that issued that corporate bond goes up and that of the buyer of that bond goes down. Some
money will flow between two commercial banks if the buyer and seller of the corporate bond have different
banks – if that happens some reserves at the Bank of England will move from one bank to another. The total
level of reserves held at the Bank of England will not change. Now suppose in the next stage the company
that issued the corporate bonds spends the money on investment, which means more wages and profits get
generated somewhere else and so the money flows into bank accounts somewhere else. Economic activity
is likely to be higher. Reserves may move (many times) from one bank’s account at the Bank of England to
another. But aggregate reserves held at the Bank of England will not change at all. Just looking at what has
happened to total reserves at the Bank of England tells you nothing about this. Nothing. If all that
economics taught us is this it would have done some good.

Figure 3 shows who was holding gilts before and during the Bank’s purchases (the last observation is
2012Q1). The government, net, has issued more gilts since 2009 than the Bank purchased. [In fact, among
the sectors that Figure 3 distinguishes, only the gilt holdings of ‘other financial institutions’ declined – these
include, for example, securities and derivative dealers, mutual funds, and mortgage lenders.] But the fact
that net issuance was larger than the Bank’s purchases does not mean that the effect of the Bank’s
purchases was diminished. The impact of a policy has to be judged against what would have happened in
the absence of the policy action. And unless one believes that net issuance of gilts would have been
significantly lower had the Bank not purchased gilts, the private sector would have had to absorb a much
larger stock of government debt. All else equal that would have reduced the supply of credit to the private
sector. The Bank’s purchases worked to offset that.
I am not going to describe in detail the empirical evidence on the impact of the Bank’s gilt purchases on the
economy; this has been done elsewhere.4 I believe the evidence is that it has had a significant positive
effect. Colleagues of mine at the Bank of England estimated that purchasing £200bn worth of gilts during
2009-10 may have increased GDP by 1.5-2%. The fact that GDP itself has been more or less stagnant for
much of the past eighteen months is not clear evidence that QE has become ineffective; it is evidence that
the forces holding back a recovery remain powerful.

Instead of focusing on the impact of QE on growth, attention has tended to concentrate on the reduction in
gilt yields, probably because the impact of gilt purchases was most visible here. But it was never the
ultimate objective of gilt purchases to lower gilt yields, just as a reduction in Bank Rate never has as its
ultimate objective to lower yields on Treasury bills. Lowering gilt yields is only the first – and not necessarily
the most important – link in a longer transmission mechanism whose overall effect is to increase the
availability of funding for the private sector, raising demand for goods and services. The impact that the
Bank’s asset purchases had on the spreads between gilt yields and yields on corporate bonds, and on
different types of bank lending, has been at least as important for the economy as the impact on the yields
on government bonds.
The second means by which the Bank loosened monetary conditions was an expansion of its lending
facilities.5 With some facilities this worked by increasing the extent to which the Bank insures solvent banks
against liquidity outflows. Figure 4 is a stylised representation of the evolution of the Bank’s lending facilities
during the crisis. Movements in the North East direction in the figure represent a widening in collateral and
an extension of the maturity of lending. In most cases such movements represented an easing in funding
conditions for banks. Liquidity insurance will be used more the lower the interest rate charged, the wider the
type of collateral accepted, and the greater the range of time horizons for which the central bank lends.
In normal times, the interest rate is the most important feature of the Bank’s lending facilities: when banks’
liquidity and solvency are not in doubt, banks are able to offset liquidity outflows with funds raised in private
markets. So they only borrow comparatively small amounts of funds from the central bank. But in the recent
crisis, banks had on occasion substantial difficulties in raising funds in private markets because investors
doubted both their liquidity and solvency. Had the Bank offered to lend only against the highest-quality
collateral, and only at a very short maturity, banks’ liquidity risk may not have fallen back significantly from
crisis levels. The term and the collateral requirements of its lending operations became important
determinants of monetary conditions. By expanding these facilities, monetary conditions eased because a
more comprehensive insurance of banks’ liquidity risks increased their willingness to grant longer-term loans
to the private sector.

Is monetary policy no longer effective?
Despite the extraordinary monetary policy measures taken, growth in the UK has been anaemic – output has
stagnated for more than a year. Some people take that fact – the fact of weak output – as proof that
monetary policy has stopped being effective and, more specifically, that purchases of government bonds
(what you might call conventional QE) is no longer effective. I think this is not very convincing because it
ignores the range of factors which have restrained demand and which might have caused output to fall
significantly had not an increasingly expansionary monetary policy been pushing back in the opposite
direction. It is not as if it is hard to identify such forces – one of which is the clear deterioration in the funding
conditions for banks across Europe that began in the Autumn of last year and which was followed by falling
confidence across most of Europe and stagnation in economic activity.
I am unconvinced that the stagnation we have seen over the past eighteen months in the UK is proof of the
ineffectiveness of monetary policy. But I do take seriously the suggestions that alternatives to what I have
9

called conventional QE might be more powerful in boosting demand. One suggestion is that the MPC should
undertake money financed spending – sometimes called a helicopter drop of money. My view on this can be
summarised quickly: Either money financing (or helicopter drops) is done in a way which pays no attention to
the inflation consequences – in which case it is not a very attractive policy – or it is done in a way which is
sensitive to the longer-term inflation consequences, in which case the differences with conventional QE
largely evaporate. Let me explain.
It is useful to start by asking what is money financed spending (or helicopter drops)? One could think of this
as the Bank of England sending a cheque to every household in the country. Would a £1,000 Christmas
bonus for every family in the UK from the Bank be a good idea? Let me make several points about the
economics of this. In doing so I will put to one side the important question about the legitimacy of the MPC
embarking on what looks like fiscal decisions – I just want to focus on the economics of the thing and ask
how this strategy differs from what I have called conventional QE. Let me start by saying that what I have
described as the Bank giving all families a Christmas Bonus is equivalent to a lump sum temporary tax cut –
a one-off reverse poll tax – financed by new issuance of government bonds (i.e. standard fiscal policy)
followed by the central bank buying those bonds in the secondary market a few moments later and then
channelling all the coupons and redemptions on those bonds straight back to the Treasury.
How is monetary part of this like conventional QE and how does it differ? It is like QE in the sense that the
coupons and redemptions from the gilts the Bank has already bought are flows of money from the
government that are accumulated in a fund that is effectively owned by the government. It is also like QE in
that the policy can be reversed later on: with QE, the gilts can be sold, and with money-financed spending,
the government could later increase taxes temporarily to recoup what it had paid out to households. The
bank reserves that are created as a by-product of the Bank’s QE gilt purchases are not zero-interest bearing
money (as in a Friedman style helicopter drop) – they pay Bank Rate. But they do so in an environment in
which Bank Rate is close to zero.
The QE gilt purchases by the Bank are not guaranteed to be permanent – they can be reversed. Whether
and when they are reversed will depend on inflation conditions and on what level of reserves the banking
system comes to want to hold. Bank Rate will also depend on inflation conditions. So the key difference
between the helicopter drops of money (which is money financed fiscal policy) and conventional QE is that,
with the latter, the terms on which the asset purchases by the central bank are made are flexible and
sensitive to inflation pressures in the economy, while with money financing they might not be. If Bank Rate is
kept close to zero, if coupon payments on gilts are channelled back to the government and if new bonds are
bought as old ones mature, then conventional QE looks very much like money financing of government
spending (helicopter drops of money). If Bank Rate is increased, or if the stock of government bonds held by
the Bank are run down, it will come to be less like helicopter drops of money. How much like helicopter
drops it is depends on subsequent monetary policy decisions made in the light of inflation pressures. Why
10

would one not want that? Why would irreversible helicopter drops be superior, when they might ultimately
generate inflation pressures that would be unwelcome6? Why not prefer a more flexible policy where asset
purchases can be adapted if inflation pressures pick up and the demand stimulus they generate no longer
brings forth more output but instead just creates higher prices? Surely one wants unconventional monetary
policy to boost demand when that generates more economic activity but to have a declining impact once the
extra demand is largely showing up in higher prices rather than in volumes. To my mind this is exactly what
asset purchases – conventional QE – does. If helicopter drops of money are reversed when their
impact shows up very largely in prices and not in activity, the economic difference with conventional
QE largely evaporates.
The Bank’s asset purchases can be reversed and are financed by the creation of reserves that pay Bank
Rate. Therefore they are not the equivalent to permanent money financing of government spending. Yet
some have argued that the Bank is effectively monetising the government’s debt and has lost the focus on its
inflation target. I believe this criticism is misguided. Monetising the debt would involve the central bank
buying up government bonds permanently, and financing the purchase by issuing non-interest bearing
liabilities, independently of predicted inflation. That is the crucial distinction between QE and what I called
helicopter drops of money done in a way that is not adjusted if it later generates inflation. The decision of the
MPC to embark on asset purchases on an enormous scale was not done because it had abandoned the
inflation target; it was done because of the inflation target. It was done because the outlook for demand has
been so weak that unless monetary policy was set to offset this it was likely that inflation would ultimately be
driven below the target level as output languished far below the productive potential of the economy. The
fact that many asset purchases were made at a time when inflation was substantially above target meant
that many people interpreted it as an abandonment of the target. But that would only be a natural
interpretation if the current level of inflation was a good indicator of underlying inflation pressures – and that
was clearly not the case for much of 2011 and into 2012. The fact that the Bank has bought £350 billion of
assets and that most private sector forecasts now show inflation will remain near the target level is a telling
piece of evidence against the argument that asset purchases show that the MPC has given up on inflation
targeting. (There is a different argument that the MPC should give up on inflation targeting that I will return to
later).
Observations from this extraordinary period
Let me stand back a moment and review what has happened over the past 5 years. Where we have got to is
extraordinary: Bank Rate is at its lowest in 300 years and has been there since early 2009; The Bank’s
balance sheet has increased almost fivefold7; some £350 billon of government bonds have been purchased
by the central bank – and those purchases are continuing. The range of assets that commercial banks can

If helicopter drops are not permanent, and the government decides to later reverse their impact if they ultimately raise inflation
significantly, then it would need to run a surplus (or overfund) to remove the money that had been created.

use to borrow against from the Bank of England has been widened; and – more recently – the Funding for
Lending Scheme has been launched – a scheme that in some ways sits in the grey area between monetary
and fiscal policy and one that I will return to in a moment.
I make three observations on monetary policy in the light of these extraordinary events.
First, it is sometimes alleged that a central bank becomes powerless when short-term interest rates are near
zero. The rationale is that at near-zero interest rates, the private sector’s opportunity costs from holding
money are also near zero, so the private sector is willing to hold any amount of money that the central bank
injects without requiring a further decline in interest rate. The central bank then cannot relax monetary
conditions further: the economy is in a liquidity trap.
This is not a good description of where we have been. It assumes that there is only one short term interest
rate in the economy. In fact the rates that really matter to the private sector – for example rates charged on
business loans, yields on corporate bonds and rates on mortgages – have been far above the policy rate set
by the Bank of England. One of the central aims of QE has been to try to stop those spreads widening
further and to ease the flow of credit to the private sector. Clearly the cost of bank funding in private markets
has remained substantially above Bank Rate. Longer-term lending programmes such as the recently
launched Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) have been designed to increase credit supply by reducing
banks’ funding costs, particularly for new lending. The FLS is designed to ease monetary conditions by
helping banks secure funding in private markets for a four-year period – a much longer term than that of
other Bank lending operations. The scheme incentivises banks to expand lending because funding is
cheaper the greater the rise (or smaller the fall) in lending. What makes the scheme attractive to banks is
not only the small size of the fee that the Bank charges but, crucially, also the Bank’s willingness to accept
collateral that private market participants might refuse. None of this would be necessary if we were in a
liquidity trap.
My second observation is that the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy can become blurred in crisis
times. I illustrated this above in my comparison of out and out money financed spending (helicopter drops of
money) and what I call conventional QE. Gilt purchases might seem to fall into the grey area between
monetary and fiscal policy because they lower gilt yields, and reduce the Treasury’s refinancing costs.
The blurring is also to some extent there with all liquidity support operations and with the Funding for Lending
Scheme. Lending to banks against a wide range of collateral and for a longer term increases the central
bank’s credit risk, so ultimately puts taxpayers’ money at risk. In the Funding for Lending Scheme the Bank
accepts a wide range of collateral, including new loans that the banks make. Because the value of the
collateral is not guaranteed, this introduces an element of credit risk even in the presence of
over-collateralisation [that is the substantial haircuts that the Bank makes].

My final observation is about the link between the amount of central bank reserves and inflation. It is
sometimes claimed that the huge expansion of reserves held at the central bank – which are the counterpart
to QE – has to greatly increase inflation at some point in the future. This argument is based implicitly on
some version of the quantity equation for money: the supply of money (M) multiplied by the velocity with
which money circulates (V) is equal to the price level (P) multiplied by the number of transactions paid for
using money (T). That is:
MV = PT
This equation is simply a definition for the velocity of money. But some commentators interpret it as if there
were a mechanical link between the growth of reserves (part of a narrow measure of M) and ultimate
changes in the price level P. This really asks too much of an identity. Inflation arises when demand for
goods and services exceeds the supply potential of the economy at a given price level. My own view is that
demand depends on interest rates far more reliably than it does upon a measure of the amount of money.
Crucially, as long as the central bank retains control over the short-term interest rate, it can operate
monetary policy with a substantially higher amount of reserves. If the Bank did not remunerate reserves at
the policy rate, short-term market interest rates might fall below it. By remunerating reserves at Bank Rate,
short-term market interest rates are much less likely to fall below Bank Rate: because of arbitrage, investors
with reserve accounts – which include all the UK’s major banking groups – should not grant loans at an
interest rate below Bank Rate.
The quantity equation if used in a mechanical way omits the impact of interest rates and it tells one nothing
about shifts in the demand for money that will make velocity vary. And in fact velocity is highly variable.
Figure 5 plots an estimate of the velocity of narrow money, assuming that the total number of transactions is
proportional to real GDP. This estimate of velocity had been around 30 between the early 1990s and 2006,
reflecting the low level of central bank reserves, before the Bank started to pay interest on reserves in 2006.
It fell further when the banking sector’s reserve holdings increased during the Bank’s asset purchases, falling
to a level of about 7 by Q1 2012.

(a) Nominal GDP figures are four-quarter backward-looking sums. ‘Sum of reserves, notes and coins’ is measured by the Bank’s M0
series until publication was discontinued in August 1997. From then on it is measured as the sum of monetary and financial institutions’
‘Other deposits with the Bank of England’ (including reserves) and ‘Notes and coin’ in circulation. All series apart from ‘Other deposits
with the Bank of England’ have been seasonally adjusted.

Empirical studies tend to use a broader monetary aggregate, such as M4 – rather than the sum of reserves,
notes and coins (also referred to as M0) – when computing the velocity of money. Indeed, the ratio of
nominal GDP to M4 is much steadier, having fallen from around 2 during the sixties and seventies to around
1 today (Figure 6). But this does not shed any light on the link between the amount of reserves and inflation,
precisely because the relationship between M4 and M0 is as volatile as the relationship between nominal
GDP and M0 (Figure 7).
Claiming that asset purchases and the rise in reserves must lead to much higher inflation down the road is
therefore wrong. The key factor is whether Bank Rate – and the stock of asset purchases – are
appropriately set to meet the inflation target given the relative movements of demand and supply; and, more
generally, whether the monetary policy stance is appropriate. Historically, growth in some monetary
aggregate may well have been associated with consumer price inflation over the long run – but only if
interest rates have moved in such a way as to make such a co-movement possible.

The MPC loosened monetary conditions in order to meet the Bank’s inflation target in the face of a downturn
almost unprecedented in modern economic times. The MPC’s forecasts suggested that without this
loosening, which involved an increase in the amount of reserves, inflation would have undershot its target in
the medium term. Measures of underlying inflation, which attempt to exclude the influences of one-off
shocks on the price level from the headline inflation rate, were volatile but taken as a whole remained close
to target during the past few years (Figure 8). When the MPC’s inflation projections suggest that monetary
conditions should be tightened, it will reverse some of the extraordinary stimulus that monetary policy has
provided over the past few years.

What should the post-crisis monetary policy framework look like?
The way in which the Bank implements monetary policy has changed substantially since the start of the
crisis8. Some of the changes are temporary – I believe, for example, the main policy instrument will again be
Bank Rate, not purchases and sales of gilts. But other changes will be more long lasting. For example
although the FLS (and the SLS before it) are designed to be temporary schemes, the liquidity insurance

facilities introduced since 2007-08 have become part of the Bank’s permanent Sterling Market Framework.
And the Bank will probably operate permanently with a substantially larger balance sheet: banks have learnt
that they took excessive liquidity risks before the crisis, and are likely to want to hold substantially higher
levels of liquid assets in future (Figure 9). Some of these assets are likely to be held in the form of central
bank reserves.

I want to look at three specific questions about policy in the future. First, whether there is a compelling
argument against continuing to remunerate reserves at Bank Rate and allowing banks to choose their
reserve targets; second, whether the inflation target should be raised to reduce the likelihood that the
monetary policy stance is too tight even with Bank Rate at (almost) zero; and third, whether the inflation
targeting regime should be changed.
In the pre-crisis system of implementing monetary policy banks chose, subject to some restrictions, the level
of their reserve targets. This system effectively reduces private banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves
to zero – banks could repo assets to the Bank of England in exchange for reserves and be charged Bank
Rate, and then earn Bank Rate on those reserves so long as they stayed close to their pre-agreed reserves
target. I think this system has the great advantage of not penalising banks for holding the most liquid of

assets (bank reserves) by keeping their effective price close to the Bank’s cost of creating them – which is
virtually zero.
This arrangement is in the spirit of Friedman’s principle, which is that the opportunity cost of holding money
faced by private agents should be zero because the social cost of creating reserves is zero. (For a recent
re-statement of the result see also Curdia and Woodford, 20119.)
Should the level of the inflation target be changed? One argument for raising the inflation target is that with
higher average inflation, the chances that the central bank is constrained by a zero lower bound on the
nominal interest rate it controls are lower. With inflation at 5%, setting Bank Rate to zero would reduce the
real interest rate to -5%, whereas with inflation at 2%, setting Bank Rate to zero would ‘only’ reduce the real
interest rates to -2%. So to reduce the chances of the lower bound on interest rates becoming a constraint
on policy it might seem sensible to raise the target.
I do not find this argument compelling. Elevated levels of inflation are costly for households and firms: prices
need to be changed more frequently, or else they become more dispersed across firms. In addition, a higher
average rate of inflation has historically meant higher volatility of inflation making it more difficult for people to
compare prices. And the benefits of raising the inflation target appear small.
First, the central bank does not become powerless when Bank Rate reaches zero. It can further loosen
monetary policy by engaging in asset purchases, or by increasing the amount of liquidity insurance that it
provides to the banking sector.
Second, it strikes me as far more likely that a desirable way to respond to the problems we have faced in
recent years is to have banks use more capital (equity funding). With the benefit of hindsight the amount of
capital banks had pre-crisis was remarkably (indeed ridiculously) low. One of the reasons why the sharp
reduction in Bank Rate had a less expansionary effect than one might have hoped was that the funding cost
of bank-dependent borrowers remained elevated. The reason was (and is) that banks are perceived to be
quite risky. One way of ensuring that bank funding costs respond more to a reduction in Bank Rate is to
make them safer by requiring them to use more capital. Higher capital increases banks’ resilience, reducing
their borrowing costs. Higher levels of capital also help finance lending directly: capital is lent out – it is not
kept in a vault.
What about the inflation targeting regime itself? Economists have discussed for many years whether the
central bank’s target should include other things besides inflation. The argument in favour – to boil it down to
its most simple – is that targeting inflation is too narrow. I do not find this very compelling either – and many

of the arguments against inflation targeting are in fact arguments against inflexible inflation targeting rather
than against having an inflation target guide policy. Self evidently inflation is affected by a wide range of
macroeconomic variables, including asset prices, credit growth, the saving plans of households and the
change in the supply capacity of the economy. Ultimately inflation reflects the relative size of the demand for
output and the supply capacity of the economy – which in turn depends upon the supply of labour and saving
from households. In the light of this the idea that focusing on inflation means focusing on some narrow
aspect of economic activity has always struck me as bizarre.

(a) The questions on inflation expectations ask about expected changes in prices, but do not reference a specific price index. Inflation
expectation measures are based on the median estimated price change. Data are not seasonally adjusted. The last CPI observation is
July 2012; it is 2012Q3 for the Bank/NOP and Barclays surveys, and August 2012 for the Citi/YouGov survey.

Inflexible inflation targeting – by which I mean the strategy of setting policy to bring inflation back to target in
the shortest period possible irrespective of why it has been blown away from that target – is not at all
desirable. Inflexible targeting is essentially the same thing as focusing on contemporaneous inflation. The
MPC does not attempt to target contemporaneous inflation, but inflation in the medium term, and its mandate
explicitly allows it to let inflation temporarily deviate from the inflation target to avoid excessive volatility of
output. This enables the MPC to look through one-off price level shocks. The past few years illustrate the
advantages of having such a flexible inflation targeting regime. While one-off price level shocks increased
headline CPI inflation to far above the target, the MPC continued to loosen the monetary policy stance,
countering the enormous recessionary forces we have faced. To have not done so would – I believe – have
created hugely higher unemployment and a deeper slump in activity and that would have meant the inflation

rate – which is today quite close to 2% – would probably sit far beneath it. During this period of exceptionally
easy monetary policy longer-term inflation expectations remained relatively stable (Figure 10).
The inflation targeting regime did not prevent monetary policy being moved in response to the recession –
exactly the opposite is true. Some have said this is because the inflation targeting regime was abandoned.
This is not at all how it felt to me on the MPC and Figure 10 suggests it was not how it seemed to most
people.
How might we get back to more normal conditions?
A rapid return to more normal monetary policy is not imminent. But thinking through how this might
ultimately be done is essential to working out how much further from normal one should go. One would
certainly want to know how the brakes on a car work and how to engage reverse gear before you decide how
much faster and further to drive forward.
The timing and the speed of reversing the unusually accommodative monetary policy stance will be
determined by the outlook for inflation – as was the timing and speed of lowering Bank Rate, of purchasing
assets, and of extending the Bank’s lending facilities. There are many ways in which monetary policy could
come to be normalised. This raises a question of sequencing: should Bank Rate be increased first, or should
the Bank first reduce its portfolio of gilts?
I believe there are likely to be advantages to raising Bank Rate first, and I would expect this to be the
strategy10. First, the costs of reversing any premature tightening would appear to be lower. And second, it
may have advantages for financial stability because some banks and building societies have indexed a
substantial proportion of their lending to Bank Rate, while their funding costs depend on market conditions.
So keeping Bank Rate low squeezes the margins of these financial institutions and weakens them.
Let me explain the first point in a bit more detail. At some point it will seem right to scale back the degree to
which monetary policy is exceptionally expansionary. No one will be sure when that time has come. If you
waited until it was absolutely clear that policy needed to be less expansionary you have almost certainly
waited too long. So in the months after the first tightening move, there is a considerable probability that the
MPC would have to reverse course and loosen monetary policy.
Were the first tightening move to be a sale of a proportion of the Bank’s holdings of gilts while Bank Rate is
still close to zero, reversing the tightening would require the Bank to repurchase (some of) the gilts it had just
sold. Reversing the trajectory of gilt holdings would create unnecessary volatility in the market for gilts. Put

Source: Bank of England. Cumulated gilt purchases were £347.75bn on 31 August 2012.

In contrast, if the first tightening were to be an increase in Bank Rate, that rate could be lowered again if
necessary. The associated costs should be smaller because market participants are used to variations in
Bank Rate. Once Bank Rate has reached a level at which only a remote possibility remains of having to
quickly lower Bank Rate again to almost zero, the Bank could tighten monetary conditions by selling gilts.
In the meantime, the portfolio of gilts might already start to shrink for two reasons. First, the Bank has not so
far reinvested the coupon payments it receives on the gilts11. And second, the first gilts in its portfolio will
mature from 2013 onwards (Table 1). Table 1 shows that by the end of 2015 about £126 billion of coupons
and redemptions would have been generated by the existing stock of gilts the Bank has bought.
Conclusion
Monetary Policy has been set in ways that are exceptional – rightly so, since we have been dealing with the
aftermath of a huge and global crisis. The blurring of lines between fiscal and monetary policy is inevitable
once the policy rate becomes close to zero so that policy can be only made significantly more expansionary
by the central bank expanding its balance sheet. That blurring does not mean that the aims of monetary
policy have become unclear – it is still being conducted with an inflation target as the guiding light. Rather
than the focus on inflation being an unhelpful constraint on policy it is the natural means by which one judges
how expansionary monetary policy should be. Once one takes account of the dependence of the setting of
monetary policy on the inflation outlook the apparent advantages in boosting demand of the monetisation of
government spending (or helicopter drops), relative to conventional QE, largely evaporates. Because QE
11

Most gilts were bought at above par since the yields were below the coupon rate. This means that the value of the gilts is likely to
decline slightly if none of the coupons is re-invested.

takes the inflation outlook explicitly into account, monetisation of government debt has no clear advantages
over QE.
The forces unleashed by the financial crisis that began 5 years ago have been extraordinarily damaging to
incomes and wealth. The banking system across much of the rich, western world remains damaged.
Monetary policy in the UK has been set to its most expansionary setting in history; and I believe it is right that
it is still being moved further in that direction. But economic activity has not collapsed; unemployment has
risen but has not exploded and inflation has neither soared nor become entrenched at a negative rate. I do
not consider this a great success. Perhaps the most one could say is that the boat has not capsized even
though the steering wheel has been turned exceptionally hard in one direction.
Some people conclude from this that the charts we had to guide setting economic policy – largely created by
economists – have been proved useless for navigation. I think that this is both nihilistic and naïve. If I
thought that economics had somehow been proved useless – or just plain wrong – I would conclude tonight
by suggesting the Scottish Economic Society find a new name. But I don’t see any reason to do that. And I
do not think that Adam Smith or David Hume would either.
