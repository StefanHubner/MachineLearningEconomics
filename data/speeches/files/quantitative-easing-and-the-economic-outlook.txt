Good evening! I doubt that many of you will be aware that the Bank of England was actually founded, in 1694,
by a Scotsman named William Paterson. Our original purpose was to raise the funds to enable the King to
finance his foreign military adventures. But Paterson soon parted company with his fellow directors, leaving the
Bank the following year.

Rather more of you may be aware that same William Paterson became the financial brains behind the Darien
scheme, a project to establish a Scottish colony in Panama that could act as trading post between the Atlantic
and the Pacific. Unfortunately, just about everything that could go wrong with the project did, resulting in not
only the deaths of many of the colonists, but also substantial financial losses for the many Scottish people who
had backed the scheme. According to historians, the Darien disaster and its financial consequences contributed
directly to the pressures leading to the 1707 Act of Union between England and Scotland.

The possible dissolution of that union is, of course, now on the agenda. Whether or not Scotland becomes an
independent country once again is a matter for the Scottish people to decide. If the referendum should result in
a vote in favour of an independent Scotland, the associated monetary arrangements would then be one of many
matters needing to be settled. But the exact form of those arrangements would be for the Westminster and
Scottish parliaments to decide, not the Bank of England.

Until asked to do otherwise, the Bank will continue to use the powers delegated to us by the UK Parliament to try
to deliver, to the best of our ability, monetary and financial stability for the United Kingdom as it stands, including
being represented here through our Agency in Scotland. In keeping with that, my remarks tonight will focus not
on what may, or may not, happen to the UK’s monetary arrangements some years down the road, but rather on
our more immediate economic prospects and the actions that the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee has taken
to try to sustain the recovery.

As you will be aware, last October the Monetary Policy Committee resumed its purchases of government debt,
financed by the issuance of additional claims on the Bank of England – so-called quantitative easing. At our
most recent policy meeting less than a fortnight ago, we voted to make a further £50 billion of purchases, which
will take the total sum bought to £325 billion. To give you some context, that represents about a fifth of the
annual output of the United Kingdom and around a third of the total stock of UK government debt in issue.

Why did we decide to inject further monetary stimulus into the economy? And how likely is it to be effective? We
started quantitative easing in March 2009 in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, as the UK
economy was undergoing its deepest post-war contraction. Bank Rate was almost as low as it could go and
further stimulus was necessary to put a floor under demand and get the economy growing again. All told we
bought £200 billion of gilts during that initial phase of quantitative easing.

Quantitative easing essentially involves trading one liability of the state – gilts – for another – monetary claims on
the Bank of England. We aim to buy mainly from non-bank private financial institutions, such as pension funds

and insurance companies, not from the banks, as is sometimes erroneously claimed1. When we buy a gilt, we
simply credit the bank account of the seller with an appropriate sum. If the seller were indifferent between
holding the gilt and holding the associated bank deposit, that is where things would stop. But because deposits
tend to yield less than gilts and assets such as corporate bonds and equities, the seller is likely to want to buy
some other asset instead. The consequence is upward pressure on the prices of a whole range of assets,
including corporate bonds and equities. That increases the availability, and reduces the cost, of finance to
corporates. It also boosts the value of people's wealth, which should encourage more spending.

As I noted a moment ago, we aim to acquire the gilts from institutions other than banks. But as a by-product of
the purchase, banks will find that they have both more customer deposits and an increase in their claims on us
(what are known as bank reserves). That may encourage them to increase their lending, though in the particular
circumstances prevailing during and after the financial crisis, we expected this effect to be quite weak. That is in
line with the observed weakness in bank lending over the past three years.

Our analysis of the first phase of quantitative easing suggests bond yields were around one percentage point
lower than they would otherwise have been. And UK equity prices rose 50% during the programme, though only
a small part of that is likely to be down to quantitative easing. That made it cheaper for companies to access
finance through the capital markets and issuance was indeed strong during 2009. But the ultimate aim was to
sustain demand. Though we cannot be sure what would have happened in the absence of our asset purchases,
our internal work suggests that the first phase of quantitative easing boosted the level of activity by around
1½-2%.

Having finished the first programme of purchases in early 2010, why then did we deem it necessary to restart the
programme last October and extend it at our February meeting?

During late 2009 and through 2010, a recovery of sorts appeared to be taking hold and, by the beginning of last
year, some of us were starting to think that the time to begin withdrawing some of the monetary stimulus might
be starting to draw near. As the year wore on, though, it became increasingly clear that the underlying growth
rate was moderating.

To begin with, that reflected a continuing squeeze on household real incomes, and thus on spending, resulting
from the increase in the standard rate of VAT in January and the impact of higher energy and import prices. In
fact, real household income declined a total of 2½% in the two years after output troughed, whereas in normal
conditions it might have been expected to rise about 5% in that time. But since last August, the deterioration
also seems to have reflected heightened concerns about the prospects for the euro area. That was reflected in
much tighter funding conditions for European banks, including those in the United Kingdom, and increased
caution on the part of businesses both in regards to hiring and capital spending. Output is reported to have

contracted by 0.2% in the final quarter, though some of the business surveys at the start of this year suggest that
the economy may again be expanding.

It was that deterioration in the outlook that led us to restart our asset purchases in October. Despite the recent
more encouraging signs, we continue to expect underlying growth to remain sluggish in the first half of the year
(the actual data are likely to move somewhat erratically because of the extra holiday associated with the
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee). But inflation has been falling sharply, down from its peak of 5.2% in September to
3.6% in January and is likely to continue declining as increases in energy prices a year ago drop out of the
calculation. That means that the long-lasting squeeze on household real incomes is also starting to ease. In
turn, that should facilitate a modest pickup in household spending; the upbeat retail sales figures announced at
the end of last week may be a sign this is already starting to happen. But while growth should gradually
strengthen, the continuing headwinds from the unwinding of excessive debt and the Government’s continuing
fiscal consolidation mean that the pace of recovery is likely to remain moderate by historical standards.

As a consequence, a margin of unused capacity and labour in the economy is likely to persist for some while yet,
helping to ensure that domestically generated inflation – presently running around 1½%, depending on exactly
how one chooses to measure it – should stay subdued. Indeed, in the absence of the extra £50 billion of gilt
purchases announced two weeks ago, we judged that inflation would be rather more likely than not to
undershoot our 2% target in the medium term. That was why we decided that it was necessary to do more.

Moreover, the longer capacity lies idle, the more likely it is to be scrapped completely. And the longer people are
out of work, the more likely they are to become disconnected from the labour market altogether. So there is an
added incentive to getting the recovery back on track quickly.

The euro area represents the biggest single downside risk to this picture. Greece is the country in the headlines
right now, but several countries of the euro-area periphery face, in varying degrees, a challenging mixture of
unsustainably high public and/or private indebtedness and weak competitiveness. Correcting those problems
requires: fiscal consolidation; bank recapitalisation; and a rebalancing of demand towards net exports. The first
two are under way, but the third is harder to achieve in a monetary union where no exchange rate movement is
possible to bring about the necessary improvement in international competitiveness. At best, these countries
face an extended period of very low growth while the necessary adjustments take place. And while this
morning’s agreement between the Greek government and the euro-area authorities is certainly welcome, there
still remains a possibility that events could unfold in a disorderly and damaging fashion at some stage in the
future.

The linkages to the United Kingdom from such a disorderly outcome would be threefold. First, and most
obviously, almost half our exports go to the euro area, so weak growth there has a rather direct spillover on to
us. Second, although UK banks’ exposures to governments, households and businesses in the affected
countries are generally manageable, they do have exposures to, and get finance from, euro-area banks which
are more heavily exposed. A disorderly outcome in the euro area could then result in a tightening of the

availability of funds to UK banks as a result of this interconnectedness and thus also in the credit extended to UK
households and businesses. Third, a bad outcome would probably knock confidence and lead UK households
and businesses to hunker down and postpone spending.

There is little that the Monetary Policy Committee – or, indeed, the Government – can do to influence the
outcome of events beyond our shores. In particular, it would make little sense to set the level of asset purchases
so as to try to counteract an extreme event whose likelihood, timing and magnitude we have no realistic way of
assessing.

The latest extension of our asset purchase programme has proved controversial in some quarters. Some
commentators have questioned its likely effectiveness in stimulating demand. Others have focussed on the
undesirable distributional consequences.

As far as the effectiveness of the policy goes, the impact depends on what those who have sold the gilts do with
the money we give them in return, and how banks, businesses and households respond to the resulting
movements in asset prices and money holdings. It is quite possible that the impact of a given quantum of
purchases will be different at different times and be sensitive to the prevailing economic conditions. But that is
also the case with changes in Bank Rate, where the effects can be equally uncertain.

Tracking the impact of the new round of purchases is also harder than before. Market participants have
increasingly come to anticipate our actions, so that asset prices tend to move ahead of our decisions. That
makes it difficult to isolate the impact on asset prices of policy changes from the myriad of other things driving
them. The fact that UK government bond yields have fallen about a quarter percentage point more than those in
Germany and the United States since the late summer is, however, at least consistent with the effect we
expected. In any case, so far we have seen little to suggest that the effect on nominal demand will be markedly
at odds with that of our first round of purchases. But it is still rather early to draw firm conclusions one way or the
other.

Turning to the distributional consequences of the asset purchases, attention has focussed on the downward
impact on annuity rates, which have fallen about a percentage point over the past three years since we started
our purchases. That means someone2 with a £100,000 pension pot, who could have expected that to yield an
annual pension of a little under £7,000 three years ago, would now get just under £6,000. That is a rather
substantial income loss. But it is only part of the story. Those pension funds will typically have been invested in
a mix of bonds and equities, with perhaps a bit of cash too. The rise in asset prices as a result of quantitative
easing consequently also raises the value of the pension pot, providing an offset to the fall in annuity rates3. The
impact of quantitative easing on those approaching retirement is thus more complex than it seems at first blush.

More generally, the current extended period of rock-bottom interest rates has impacted heavily on those holding
most of their savings in deposit or short-term savings accounts, who have seen negative real returns. Savers
have every right to feel aggrieved at losing out; after all, they did nothing to cause the financial crisis. But neither
did most of those in work, who have also seen a substantial squeeze in their real incomes. And unemployment,
particularly among the young, has risen as output has fallen. This is all a reflection of the hit to output from the
financial crisis. Output is still some 4% below its previous peak and more than 10% below where it would have
been if the economy had simply continued growing at its pre-crisis historical trend. There have been few
winners over the past few years.

In a deep sense, the low level of real interest rates here and in the other advanced economies is a reflection of
the impact on the financial crisis. Heightened uncertainty and, for some households, a desire to reduce their
indebtedness have resulted in an increased propensity to save. And the same heightened uncertainty has
reduced the appetite of businesses to invest and encouraged them to build up cash buffers. Substantial
dissaving by the public sector could offset that initially, but there are limits to how long the markets will allow high
deficits to be sustained. Fiscal consolidation was unavoidable at some juncture.

Given that, the stance of monetary policy needs to be loose in order to sustain demand. If we had chosen to run
a substantially tighter monetary policy, then that would only have served to depress activity and raise
unemployment even further. By slowing growth, it would also make the task of fiscal consolidation and
de-leveraging even more challenging. And by providing a gloomier climate for business, it would also inhibit
investment and slow the necessary re-balancing of our economy towards manufacturing and internationally
tradable services.

Treating serious medical conditions often has unwanted side effects. But, unpleasant as those side effects
sometimes are, treatment is invariably better than the alternative. So it is with the economic medicine of low
interest rates and quantitative easing. The immediate consequences may be unpalatable, but the sooner we can
get the economy on the mend, the sooner we can return policy to more normal settings and the better it will be
for all of us – savers, businesses and employees alike.

Thank you!
