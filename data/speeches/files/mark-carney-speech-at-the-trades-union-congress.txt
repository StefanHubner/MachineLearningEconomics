President and Congress.

It is a pleasure to be in Liverpool today to discuss the prospects for the UK labour market.

The growth and distribution of jobs and incomes matter to everyone.

Employment does much more than provide the means to support workers and their families; it is essential to
personal fulfilment and human dignity.

Part of that dignity is being paid a living wage.

Over the past year, the Bank of England has ensured that it pays all of its 3,600 staff at least the living wage.

And we have recently brought all our contracted service staff in central London up to the London living wage.

We are in the process of our final review. But I can announce today the Bank’s intention to become an
accredited Living Wage employer by the time of the next TUC conference.

Of course, the Bank of England’s responsibilities for promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom
go much further than being a responsible employer.

We manage monetary policy to achieve price stability: low, stable and predictable inflation.

And we promote financial stability by regulating and supervising financial institutions as well as by taking
targeted actions to insure against unsustainable indebtedness, as we did earlier this year for the housing
market.

By maintaining price and financial stability we put in place the foundations for sustainable job creation and
income growth.

Stability gives workers the confidence to invest in skills or to change jobs. And it gives firms the confidence
to hire new workers, invest in new equipment, introduce new products and pursue new markets. We need
workers with the right skills. And we need companies taking strategic initiatives to grow productivity. That
productivity is needed to secure real wage increases over the medium term.

And as I will explain, the labour market is central to our decisions – decisions which must take into account
both short-term fluctuations and the profound changes sweeping labour markets across advanced
economies.

These changes include:

-

Powerful demographic forces, notably the ageing of the workforce, increases in longevity and rising
participation of women in the workplace;

-

How globalisation and new technologies are splitting production chains across companies and
across borders;

-

How financial risk is being steadily shifted to employees from both employers and the state through
changes to the structure of pensions and benefits, reduced job security and evolving labour market
institutions, including the union movement;

-

The sharp reduction in the employment share of middle-skilled jobs, relative to more- and less-skilled
jobs; so-called job polarisation.1

Collectively, these trends have affected the dynamism of labour markets and the spending patterns of
families.

And they have interacted with the forces unleashed by the Great Recession to challenge the durability of the
expansion.

The Great Recession led to enormous dislocations in advanced economy labour markets.

In many economies unemployment and underemployment skyrocketed. Youth unemployment reached
perilous levels.

Central banks responded with unprecedented monetary stimulus.

That was consistent with their price stability mandates. And it recognised the threat that the recession might
permanently scar the workforce.

As the recovery in many advanced economies has evolved, central banks are assessing the extent of
structural changes in labour markets and are grappling with what they mean for monetary policy.

The answer is not uniform across major economies. This is one reason why monetary policy in the US, euro
area and the UK can be expected to be less synchronised than in recent years.

1. A tale of three labour markets

Indeed, despite common underlying influences, differences in how the labour markets of major economies
responded to the Great Recession have been striking (Chart 1).

The US

Take the world’s largest economy – the United States – as a benchmark.

Unemployment there more than doubled during the recession. While that rate has recently fallen back, that
headline is much better than the details.

The number of Americans in work has only just returned to where it was before Lehman failed, even though
there are now 14 million more people of working age.
Much of the fall in the unemployment rate is the result of workers in their prime leaving the labour force.2 3

Far more vacancies remain unfilled than usual, indicating big mismatches in the labour market. And fewer
people than normal are switching jobs, suggesting an ongoing reluctance to take risks.

The American labour market still is not working as it once did.

The UK

Even though times for many families have been tough, relative to that benchmark, the UK labour market has
performed well.

Despite a recession that was deeper and more prolonged, unemployment did not rise as much and has
fallen back sharply since.4

In contrast to the US, this rapid fall has been accompanied by significantly higher participation rates.
2

See Yellen, J (2014), “Labor market dynamics and monetary policy”, Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic
Symposium, Jackson Hole. In addition, Erceg and Levin (2013) show that there was a reduction in US participation rates of around
2½% between 2007-12. Of that, rates fell most markedly among the young (reflecting higher educational enrolment) and ‘prime age’
adults 25-54 years old. There was a sharp up-tick in older workers claiming forms of social insurance; but that was partly offset by
higher participation rates among older workers, perhaps reflecting a need to offset lost retirement income. Erceg, C and Levin, A (2013),
“Labour force participation and monetary policy in the wake of the Great Recession”, IMF Working Paper No. 13/245, July.
3
The 3pp fall in the participation rate is a marked break from its stable level in the preceding decade. Overall participation was flat at
around 66% between 2004-7. It had fallen to below 63% in early 2014 (Bureau of Labour Statistics). By contrast, before that, and over
the longer run, participation rates had been essentially acyclical – invariant to business cycle conditions (Erceg and Levin, 2013).
4
Outturns for unemployment have remained some way below what would have been expected given the past relationship between
changes in unemployment and growth (Okun’s law). Year-on-year increases in unemployment during 2008-9, for example, remained
around 1ppt below a simple Okun relationship based on data since the early 1970s. That is in stark contrast to the experience of the US
in that period, where unemployment outturns were some way above past Okun’s law relationships.

There are now over one million more people in work in the UK than at the start of the crisis. Total hours
worked are some 4% above their pre-crisis level.

That exceptional employment performance has come at a cost, however: wage growth has been very weak.
Adjusted for inflation, wages have fallen by around a tenth since the onset of the crisis.

To find such a fall in the past, you would have to look back to the early 1920s.

The weakness of pay has, in effect, purchased more job creation. It has not resulted in an unusually high
level of profits.

The burden of the Great Recession has been shared across the UK. Profits have been squeezed almost as
much as labour costs. Employees have seen their real incomes reduced, but more people are in work as a
result.

In the US, the burden has been much more concentrated on those who have lost, and not regained, work.
And in contrast to the UK, American companies have increased their profits significantly as a share of
national income.

The euro area

What makes the UK performance even more remarkable is that we have faced the added challenge of
rebuilding competitiveness.

In the run-up to the crisis, the UK’s economy had become increasingly imbalanced.

When the crisis hit, sterling fell by a quarter. Prices of imported goods rose sharply and that fed through to
higher inflation.

The squeeze on real incomes was pronounced. And yet there were relatively few calls for higher wages to
compensate.

As a result of that painful adjustment, the UK is more competitive. And if the world economy returns to a
surer footing, there is a real prospect that the UK can properly rebalance its economy.5

Euro-area countries have needed to make similar – if larger – adjustments to restore competitiveness but
with less flexible labour markets and without a flexible currency (Charts 2-4).

The results have been dire. Euro-area unemployment has risen sharply over two successive recessions to
its current rate of over 11%. It stands at over 14% in Portugal, 20% in Spain, and 25% in Greece.

Over 6% of the euro-area labour force is now long-term unemployed and in danger of becoming detached
from the labour market.6 And despite high unemployment, there is evidence of labour shortages.7

There is a clear danger of a misplaced if not lost generation of workers in the euro area and in the US.
Britain’s labour force and trade unions deserve great credit for ensuring that this risk is much lower in the UK.
By sharing the burden, our economy is better positioned for the future. The question is whether we will seize
the opportunity.

2. Why the UK labour market outperformed: a labour supply shock

Before considering how we can, it is helpful to understand just why the UK labour market has outperformed.

When the recession hit, the demand for labour naturally fell. But surprisingly the potential supply of labour
appears to have increased as well with an estimated 1.5 million people entering the labour force.

The number of additional people wanting to work overwhelmed the longer-term effects of population ageing,
which, all else equal, would have been expected to have removed around half a million people from the
labour force (Chart 10).

This expansion of the workforce is being driven mainly by women and older workers. Before the Great
Recession, between 46% and 83% of those in the 50- to 64-year-old age cohort were active. Now it is
between 60% and 89% (Table 1). In part this reflects a continuation of past trends within age cohorts, but it
goes much further.8

The greater risks and financial burdens that many are now facing are likely to be important drivers of the
recent increase in the labour force.

6

The average of European Commission, OECD and IMF estimates of structural unemployment have increased from 8.8% in 2008 to
10.3% in 2013, reported in Draghi, M (2014), “Unemployment in the euro area”, Speech at the annual central bank symposium in
Jackson Hole, August.
7
There is evidence of there having been an increase in skills mismatch both in the rightward shift of the euro-area Beveridge curve and
as indicated by skills mismatch indices. See Draghi (ibid.).
8
Since 2007, annual average growth in participation rates has increased by 3 basis points for those between 50 and 59 years old to
between 10 and 15 basis points (Table 1). For those over 65, the increase in participation growth rates has been around 6 basis points.
Growth in participation rates also increased by around 5 basis points for those in age cohorts between 35 and 49 since 2007.

Changes to pension arrangements have encouraged people to work longer.9 State pension ages are rising,
and the default retirement age has been abolished.10

Reforms to the UK’s welfare system, including attaching job-search conditions to welfare payments, could
have prompted those affected to seek work.11

Sharp falls in wealth and increased uncertainty about future incomes following the financial crisis have
undoubtedly changed many people’s retirement plans, making them work longer and retire later in order to
compensate.12

And the scale of the debt accumulated by Britain’s households in the run-up to the recession has
encouraged more people to work, and to work longer. 13 Around 40% of households reported being
concerned about their levels of debt in 2013.14 Almost a tenth of households in a recent Bank of England
survey said they were working more because of concerns about repaying their debt.

So the strong performance of the UK labour market reflects in part people feeling compelled to work for
financial or other reasons.

When British workers have been challenged, they have not given up (Charts 5-8). Some have taken less
productive or lower-skilled jobs. Others are working part-time. Some have become self-employed. Others are
prepared to do the same work for less than they would have done.

9

Banks et al (2005) find that those in (predominantly final-salary) employer defined benefit plans report chances of working at age 60
that are, on average, 3 percentage points lower than those of individuals in the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), an
average-earnings-based defined benefit scheme. Those with defined contribution pension arrangements report probabilities up to
7 percentage points higher than those in SERPSs. See Banks, J, Emmerson, C and Blundell, R (2005), “The balance between defined
benefit, defined contribution, and state provision”, Journal of the European Economic Association, 3(2-3):466-76.
10
Cribb et al (2014) find that women’s employment rates at age 60 increased by around 7 percentage points when the state pension
age was increased to 61. Male partners’ employment rates also increased – by around 4 percentage points – perhaps indicating a
desire by couples to coordinate their retirement planning. Cribb, J, Emmerson, C and Tetlow, G (2014), “Incentives, shocks or signals:
labour supply effects of increasing the female state pension age in the UK”, IFS Working Paper No. 13/03.
11
For example, out-of-work lone parents with older children must now claim Job Seekers Allowance, a benefit with job search conditions
attached, unlike previous Income Support. Consistent with these changes, Blundell et al (2014) find that participation and employment
rates appear to have increased strongly (by 8-9%) among lone mothers who were affected by the 2010 changes. Blundell, R, Crawford,
C and Jin, W (2014), “What can wages and employment tell us about the UK’s productivity puzzle?”, The Economic Journal, 124 (May).
See also Avram, S, Brewer, M and Salvatori, A (2013), “Lone parent obligations: an impact assessment”, Department of Work and
Pensions Research Report No. 845.
12
Blundell et al (2014) examine the effects of the peak-to-trough wealth shocks implied by the financial crisis on older workers’ labour
supply. They focus on individuals aged 55-74, and examine whether changes in wealth help to predict future employment patterns in
2010-11 given employment status in 2006-7. They find evidence that shocks to housing wealth helped to predict employment status. For
example, compared to the least affected 20% of men, the worst affected 20% of men were 14% more likely to be in work in 2010-1. The
authors caution against taking too strong an interpretation of their results, however. For example, the regional house price indices used
to calculate changes in housing wealth may be capturing wider regional variation in labour demand.
13
Eggertson and Krugman (2012) illustrate how increased labour supply is one margin through which households that need to de-lever
can do so. Eggertson, G and Krugman, P, (2012), “Debt, deleveraging and the liquidity trap: a Fisher-Minsky-Koo approach”, Quarterly
Journal of Economics.

Wage pressures are, on past relationships, as low as if the unemployment rate were around 10%, not the
6.4% it is today (Chart 9).15

With more workers at competitive wages, companies have been encouraged to hire. They already had
reason to favour labour over new capital investment given the higher cost and lower availability of credit
following the financial crisis.16

This substitution of labour for capital across the economy has continued to lower productivity per hour
worked.

That weak productivity growth is not the result of laziness on anyone’s part. It is a natural consequence of so
many people wanting to work and companies employing them in place of capital.

Since the typical economist asks whether what they have observed can work in theory, the annex shows
how a ‘labour supply shock’ results in a lower path for real wages and productivity, higher employment, and
greater downward pressure on wage growth at any particular rate of unemployment.

Although the adjustment has been painful, trading off lower productivity and wages for much higher
employment, on balance it provides a solid foundation for a durable expansion. That is because keeping
people in work through a recession maximises the prospects for individuals and the economy.

By staying in work, individuals retain and learn new skills. And they are better placed to participate in the
expansion when it gathers force. This can make a material difference to an individual’s lifetime earnings.17

For the economy, maintaining workforce attachment is the best way to ensure that cyclical downturns in
aggregate demand for goods and services do not translate into permanent reductions in our economy’s
potential to supply them.

As a result, Britain has an opportunity, not often seen after a deep recession, to reach and sustain a higher
level of employment than in the past. And workers can maximise their pay prospects.

But, you rightly ask, when will this start? When will Britain get a pay rise?

Oreopoulos et al (2012) estimate that a rise in unemployment by 5 percentage points implies an average initial loss of earnings for
new college graduates of around 9 per cent, an effect which fades only after a decade. The persistent effects from adverse labour
market conditions are much larger for individuals in the first year of their careers than for those with a few years of experience. And
losses are magnified for those whose earnings are predicted to be lower, based on their college major. See Oreopoulos, P,

The expansion of labour supply does not mean permanently weak growth of real incomes.

As employment approaches its new higher level, wage pressures should increase and capital investment
should continue to recover. Productivity growth should pick up bringing the higher, sustainable pay rises that
British workers deserve.18

Specifically, the Bank’s latest forecast expects real wage growth to resume around the middle of next year
and then to accelerate as the unemployment rate continues to fall to around 5½% over the next three years.

By the end of our forecast, we see 4% nominal pay growth on average across the economy. This is
consistent with our inflation target and the economy’s potential. I will touch at the end of my remarks on how
workers and employers can raise that potential.

But first let me turn to the implications of all these labour market developments for monetary policy.

3. Monetary policy implications

One of our roles at the Bank of England is to deliver price stability in a way that supports jobs and growth.

Our price stability objective is clear: the inflation target of 2% CPI inflation.

Supporting jobs means helping the economy reach the maximum sustainable level of employment. That
level changes as the economy changes.

That is why, a little more than a year ago, even though inflation had been above the target for most of the
past five years and economic growth was poised to accelerate, we did not raise interest rates from their
historic low level of ½%.

We did not because we recognised that the UK had a huge number of unemployed and under-employed
workers and that the economy was running below full capacity. We expected inflation to fall back. We saw
that confidence might have been returning, but it remained fragile. We knew the nascent recovery was not
yet secure.

So we used the flexibility in our remit, given to us by Parliament, to return inflation to the target over a longer
period than usual in order to support sustainable jobs and growth.
18

See Barnett, A, Batten, S, Chiu, A, Franklin, J, and Sebastia-Barriel, M (2014), “The UK productivity puzzle”, Bank of England
Quarterly Bulletin, Q2, for an analysis of the UK’s ‘productivity puzzle’. The standard view has been that the UK has suffered from a
collapse in the underlying growth rate of productivity. On that basis, we would not expect there to be significant scope in future for either
productivity or real wage growth. The interpretation of the recent behaviour of the labour market as a labour supply shock has more
positive implications for the future.

To make our intentions clear, the Bank committed not to even think about raising interest rates from historic
lows at least until unemployment fell back to 7%.

That guidance gave businesses the confidence to hire and invest. It reassured households that the costs of
servicing their debts were not about to rise abruptly at a time when they remained particularly sensitive to
interest rates. And it evolved with the economy.

The effectiveness of that policy has been reinforced by the healing of the financial sector. Prompted by the
Bank of England, British banks have raised over £140 billion in new capital in the past few years. They are
right-sizing their balance sheets and re-focussing their businesses.

The recovery has exceeded all expectations. It has momentum. There has been a sustained and sharp fall
in the unemployment rate to 6.4%. Over 800,000 jobs have been created in the past year alone. We expect
robust growth of 3½% this year and 3% in 2015.

The challenge now is to secure a durable expansion; to make sure the economy realises its full potential.

What does that mean for interest rates?

With many of the conditions for the economy to normalise now met, the point at which interest rates also
begin to normalise is getting closer. In recent months the judgement about precisely when to raise Bank
Rate has become more balanced.

We have no pre-set course, however; the timing will depend on the data.

Moreover, the precise timing of the first rate rise is less important than our expectation that, when rates do
begin to rise, those increases are likely to be gradual and limited. Rates will go up only as far and as fast as
is consistent with price stability as part of a durable expansion, with the maximum sustainable level of
employment.

For a variety of reasons ranging from the weakness in the euro area, to ongoing repair of household balance
sheets, we are not expecting interest rates to head back to the levels seen before the Great Recession.19

The actual path of interest rates will be determined by the evolution of the balance of aggregate demand and
aggregate supply.

Before the crisis, monetary policy largely tracked developments in aggregate demand because the structural
dynamics of labour supply and productivity growth were relatively consistent.20 But in the wake of the crisis,
the supply side of the economy has been anything but predictable.

Originally, we thought the major uncertainties were centred on productivity growth.

But as the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has seen wages, employment and productivity evolve,
we are increasingly of the view that there has been a material labour supply shock for the reasons that I have
discussed.

So we have been paying increasingly close attention to developments in the labour market. Our forecasts
for the next three years, and hence our interest rate decisions, are based on key judgements that:

-

the number of people participating in the labour force will continue to rise, reaching 64% of the
population later in the year and continuing its upward trend of the past decade;

-

the unemployment rate that the economy can sustain without generating accelerating inflation will
return to where it was before the Great Recession (around 5%), and, at around 5½% now, is
currently only a little above that; and

-

there is scope for the average hours people work to increase further, reducing by about half the
current gap between actual and reported desired hours.

In short, and unlike the US and euro area, the economy is likely to be able to sustain a higher level of
employment than in the past. The uncertainty is less the direction of that development and more its
magnitude.

To assess that magnitude and its implications for inflation, we are tracking a range of indicators, including
those of the prospective paths for wages and unit labour costs.
Actual wage growth, at just 0.6% since a year ago excluding bonuses, is currently very weak.21 However,
there are some leading indicators that point to a modest pick up over coming quarters.

For example, job-to-job flows have been increasing (Chart 11) and some surveys of pay growth have picked
up more sharply in the last year. Although the relationship between these surveys and average wage growth
has become less robust in recent years (Chart 12), they do offer encouraging evidence of better wage
prospects for those changing or finding new jobs.

20

See Broadbent (2014).
According to the ONS AWE measure, pay excluding bonuses for employees in the economy as a whole was 0.6% higher than a year
earlier. Including bonuses, pay growth was -0.2%. In the private sector, the equivalent figures were 0.9% (excluding bonuses) and
-0.1% (including bonuses).

Of course, the pay of existing employees needs to pick up as well. After all, what matters for economy-wide
inflation is the average wage relative to economy-wide productivity.22 To that end, we will be closely
monitoring pay settlements that are bunched around the turn of the year and taking a steer from the pay of
new hires as a potential leading indicator of broader pay pressures.

Some observers have discounted the implications for inflation of the recent weakness of pay growth because
it stems from the types of jobs being filled – a ‘compositional effect’. However, these are real jobs being
performed by real people, and an increase in lower-skilled lower-wage jobs is one consequence of
working-off the labour supply shock. We also need to be mindful of the possibility that it represents part of a
longer-term trend towards job polarisation.

What matters for inflationary pressures, irrespective of the type of job, is the relationship between wages and
productivity, as captured by unit labour costs. Across the economy, wage growth is barely above productivity
growth. Unit labour costs are currently soft (growing at only around 1% in the economy as a whole), are
below the growth rate necessary to meet the inflation target, and indicate that there is further to go before we
reach the new sustainable level of employment.

In other words, there is still slack in the labour market that must be used up, and the recent revisions to the
profile of UK output up to 2012 seem unlikely to change that assessment materially. That slack is wasteful.
And if it were to remain, inflation would remain below the 2% target.

The MPC’s current best collective judgement is that, while it has narrowed rapidly, this slack is broadly in the
region of 1% of GDP. As this margin of slack continues to narrow, we expect wages to pick up slightly faster
than productivity, and unit labour cost growth should increase, consistent with meeting the inflation target.

However, the MPC expects it will take the better part of three years for this to happen.

With inflation at 1.6%, continuing downward pressure from the appreciation of sterling, and with slack
remaining, the current inflation environment is benign. But it will not remain benign if we do not increase
interest rates prudently as the expansion progresses. Our latest forecasts show that, if interest rates were to
follow the path expected by markets – that is, beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very
gradually – inflation would settle at around 2% by the end of the forecast and a further 1.2 million jobs would
have been created.

In other words, we would achieve our mandate.

There is, as always, uncertainty about the future.
22

It is the average of real unit labour costs across firms in the economy that matters for inflation.

12

But uncertainty does not mean stasis. You can expect interest rates to begin to increase.

The exact path will depend on the economy. Our assessment will undoubtedly change as the economy
evolves and policy will of course be adjusted if geopolitical events have a material impact on the outlook.

If indicators suggest the economy is moving more slowly towards our goals, we will have learned that we are
further from sustainable capacity. Prospective wage and unit labour cost growth will be weaker. Rates will
go up later and more gradually.

And should we see faster progress, prospective wage and unit labour cost growth will be stronger, which will
suggest we are closer to maximum capacity and that the economy can sustain higher rates sooner.

In all events, rate rises can be expected to be gradual and limited compared to the experience of the UK in
the past.

4. Conclusion

We are under no illusions. The Great Recession was a calamity. Britain’s workers have borne many of the
consequences.

Our job is to ensure the economy achieves its potential and to maintain price and financial stability, for
sustainable growth in jobs and incomes.

But monetary policy cannot do it alone.

Others – including trade unions, government and businesses – will determine the potential of this economy.
You will ultimately determine the size of Britain’s pay rise.

Those in work need to be able to seize new job opportunities in a world where technology and globalisation
cause labour markets to shift rapidly.

Skill levels need to be raised continually. That is of course first and foremost about education. But crucially it
also means access to lifelong learning, both on and off the job, available to all.

The TUC’s engagement with the UK’s skills agenda is a major contribution to realising that imperative. In the
past year alone, unionlearn, has supported over 200,000 people to invest in their skills.

Such investments are crucial for the durability of this economic expansion and for Britain’s future. They will
help to deliver long-term productivity – so that the British people get the pay rise they deserve.

Appendix: stylised description of labour market dynamics
This appendix sets out a stylized description of recent labour market dynamics derived from a simple model.
First, suppose firms employ labour
Firms pay a real wage of

to produce output

, where 1

is the labour share of income.

. As a result, they demand labour up to the point at which the real wage equals

its marginal product, or, in log-linear terms:
(LD)
Equation (LD) is the labour demand curve. For given final demand, , labour demand is a decreasing
function of the real wage,

.

Second, households supply labour, trading off the disutility of working more with the extra consumption
higher wage income brings. The simplest resulting labour supply curve is:
(LS)
This condition says that households supply more labour when the real wage is high, governed by the
(inverse) Frisch elasticity .
The two curves LS and LD deliver labour market equilibrium real wage and employment. That is illustrated in
Figure 1.
Figure 1: Labour market equilibrium.

Figure 2: Demand and labour supply shocks
reduce wages but can result in higher
employment.

This simple framework can be used to depict – in a simplified way – the dynamics of the crisis, as in
Figure 2.

First, a large shock to demand shifted the labour demand curve leftwards (from LD0 to LD1). The economy
moved from point A to point B. Employment fell, unemployment rose, and wages fell. This captures, in simple
terms, some features of the initial phase of the crisis.
Second, in the more recent past, labour supply rose (from LS0 to LS1), reflecting a number of forces
discussed in the text. The economy moves from point B to point C, so employment recovers (to above its
pre-crisis equilibrium), but wages continue to fall.
Weak wage growth
With some additional structure, the simple model above can be used to understand unemployment and wage
inflation.23 If wages are adjusted infrequently (ie there is nominal wage stickiness), then the following relation
between wage inflation,

, and unemployment can be derived:
(WPC)

where
and

captures expected inflation,

is the ‘natural’ rate of unemployment (which can vary over time)

is a parameter capturing the degree of wage stickiness. Equation (WPC) is the Wage Phillips Curve.

For a given natural rate of unemployment, WPC traces out the relationship between wage growth and
unemployment. Chart 9 contains a reduced-form representation of the WPC, taken from Broadbent (2014).
As that chart shows, outturns for wages in 2013 and 2014 were considerably below the past relationship,
which would otherwise suggest that unemployment would be expected to be around 10% given the observed
decline in wages. In light of equation (WPC), one way to interpret this is as there having been a decline in ,
the natural rate, such that a given rate of unemployment puts greater downward pressure on wages.
Broadbent (2014) discusses Chart 9 further.
