Communicating Monetary Policy in Practice
Vital Topics Lecture
Manchester Business School
17 May 2005
It is a great pleasure to be here, the third member of the Monetary Policy
Committee to have the privilege of speaking in this distinguished Vital
Topics lecture series at the Manchester Business School. My links with
Manchester and its business community go back around thirty years, to
when my late father, Denis Bell, was appointed chairman of the then
North Western Electricity Board (Norweb) and my family moved to the
area. They still live here, and I have been able to witness Manchester’s
stunning development and progress of recent years, be it Salford Quays,
the new merged University, or the Spinningfields development where The
Royal Bank of Scotland has its new offices.
When I accepted Professor John Arnold’s kind invitation to give one of
this year’s Vital Topics lectures, I must confess I had not appreciated that
it was to be sponsored by the Manchester Evening News and The Royal
Bank of Scotland. So I am surprised and delighted to discover that
tonight I have a double pleasure: not only am I honoured to be speaking
in this, the first Vital Topics lecture series of the new Manchester
Business School, now the largest campus-based business school in the
UK, but I am sharing the platform with an old friend and colleague from
RBS, Martin Merryman, Director of RBS Financial Markets North.
Aware that I would be approaching the end of a three-year term on the
Monetary Policy Committee when I spoke to you this evening, I had
considered that it might be appropriate to offer you some reflections on
the process and communication of monetary policy in this country. In the

3

event that seems to have been a felicitous judgement. For it was in May,
almost exactly eight years ago, shortly after an historic election victory by
the Labour party, that significant changes to the framework of monetary
policy in the United Kingdom were announced, which established the
monetary policy regime we have today. And it was in a Royal Bank of
Scotland dealing room that I heard the news.
In those days interest rate announcements were a big deal and a crew
from ITN were standing ready to film the financial markets’ reaction to
the first interest rate decision of the new Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and
to record my comments. But it was not just an interest rate change that
was announced. A new Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of
England was to be formed and given operational independence to set
interest rates to achieve the Government’s inflation target.
Hitherto interest rates had been determined by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer following consultation with the Governor of the Bank of
England. The shortcomings of this procedure, which had become known
as the “Ken and Eddie” show under the previous administration, were
contrasted with the new arrangements by then Governor Edward, now
Lord, George in a Manchester Business School Vital Topics lecture in
February 1998. As he told this audience: “the reflective, interactive,
debate within the Monetary Policy Committee is very different (too) from
the sometimes exaggerated advocacy of a particular viewpoint which
inevitably crept in to the Ken and Eddie show during which the Bank
usually had at most an hour in which to persuade a sometimes reluctant
Chancellor!1”
So unexpected was the announcement of Bank of England independence
when it came in May 1997 that it took me some minutes to persuade the
1

4

assembled team from ITN that the real story was not the interest rate
change (a rise of a quarter percentage point as it turned out) but the new
monetary regime, a story which, I believed, should lead the lunchtime
news. I was whisked to the studios where I declared that this was an
event of historic significance, a brave and progressive move that
subsequent governments would be unlikely to reverse.
And so it has proved. In the recent election campaign no major political
party proposed any changes to the system in their manifestos. And even
the particular choice of inflation target (currently 2% on the Consumer
Price Index measure of inflation), a legitimate matter for democratic
choice, was unchallenged. The new system is widely perceived to have
been a success. Until December 2003 the Monetary Policy Committee
was charged with keeping inflation of the Retail Price Index excluding
Mortgage Interest Payments (RPI-X) at 2.5%. It averaged almost exactly
that, 2.4%, over the period, never deviating by more than one percentage
point either side of target. And inflation on the new Consumer Price
Index measure is currently close to its 2% target. See chart 1. As an aside,
it should be noted that the rather higher rate recently recorded by the RPI
is due to higher mortgage costs as the MPC has raised interest rates over
the last year. RPI-X, which strips this effect out, is close to its old 2.5%
target. Moreover economic growth and employment have been
remarkably stable, though one can argue about the extent to which that
reflects good luck rather than good judgement.2
For the last three years, as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee,
I have had the privilege of being part of that process. Tonight I would
like to share with you some reflections.

As Lord George recognised, in that first MPC Vital Topics Lecture in
which he described the new arrangements, a key element of the UK’s
monetary policy framework is its transparency. Under the Bank of
England Act 1998, the goal of monetary policy is clear. It is to achieve
price stability as defined by the government’s inflation target,
reconfirmed to the Committee each year at Budget time, and, subject to
that, to support the government’s economic policy objectives. We are
lucky; not all monetary policymakers have such a clear objective. The
transparency of the target buttresses the credibility of monetary policy,
helping inflation expectations to remain anchored and making it easier to
bring inflation back to target in the event of shocks. A clear
understanding of the policy process builds confidence and mitigates
sudden surprising moves in interest rates which can unsettle real
economic behaviour.
The Committee communicates its policy in several ways. Many of the
tools it has at its disposal are an integral part of the policy framework,
enshrined in legislation and detailed in the Chancellor’s annual letter to
the Governor setting out the MPC’s remit. First, there is the monthly
interest rate announcement itself, sometimes with an accompanying
statement. Two weeks after the meeting to which they refer minutes are
published. A quarterly Inflation Report gives a detailed assessment of the
economic conjuncture and the Committee’s forecasts for growth and
inflation, detailing the uncertainties and risks to the central projection,
and is followed by a televised press conference by the Governor.
Individual members of the Committee are regularly called before
parliamentary committees, the Treasury Select Committee of the House
of Commons and the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of
Lords, and they give media interviews and speeches, working with the
twelve Agencies of the Bank around the regions and nations of the
United Kingdom. No doubt many of you will be familiar with the Bank’s

6

Agent in the North West of England, John Young, and his two deputies,
Graeme Chaplin and Neil Ashbridge.
Of course under the framework the Committee has another tool of
communication at its disposal that it has in fact not so far been able to use
in practice. Should inflation deviate from target by more than one
percentage point the Governor is required to write the Chancellor an open
letter explaining why, outlining the steps the Committee proposes to take
in response, the period within which inflation is expected to return to
target, and how this approach meets the government’s monetary policy
objectives. A further letter is to be sent after three months if inflation
remains more than one percentage point away from target. Some
commentators have interpreted this system as the Committee’s
punishment for failure if inflation falls outside an acceptable target range.
It is not. The target is a symmetric point target. The MPC is required to
achieve 2% CPI inflation at all times. But it is recognised that “the actual
inflation rate will on occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks
and disturbances. Attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these
circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output” and
employment3. In other words, in the event of a substantial shock the
letter provides a public opportunity for the Committee and Chancellor to
engage in an open debate about the desirable strategy for bringing
inflation back to target. As the Chancellor noted when setting out the
MPC’s remit: “In responding to your letter, I shall, of course, have regard
for the circumstances prevailing at the time.”
So how good is MPC communication in practice? How transparent are
we? In my experience the MPC is straightforward in its communications.
The MPC doesn’t spin. Nor are we disingenuous. For instance, if MPC
members say they are not targeting house prices, that means they are not
3

See Bank of England (2005b).

7

targeting house prices. This doesn’t always make interesting copy and
there is sometimes a tendency to look for hidden messages. But the truth
is often more simple. We are even more boring than you might think.
Unfortunately for headline writers, however, the stuff of monetary
discourse is risk and uncertainty, the nuanced probabilistic language of
possibilities and likelihoods. As the present Governor, Mervyn King,
likes to point out, the probability that our central projections for output
and inflation will be realised is close to zero. That is why the forecasts
are presented in the form of fancharts representing the Committee’s
collective view of the likely probabilities of a range of different outturns.
But, as the Governor also reminded us recently, public debate in many
policy areas deals poorly with issues of risk and uncertainty: “The
reluctance to give adequate prominence to risks may reflect the fact that
many of us feel uncomfortable with formal statements of probabilities.4”
Perhaps as a result, commentators may be inclined to over-simplify and
over-interpret MPC comment. A speech or interview is rarely a direct
hint about the next vote. It would be a foolhardy hostage to fortune if it
were.
In addition, the MPC faces a challenge in communicating policy that is
not faced by many other central banks. Monetary policy in the UK is not
formulated collectively by the Committee, but individually. The policy
decision each month is taken by majority vote and each member is
individually accountable to the government, parliament and the public at
large for his or her decisions. The votes, and the arguments which inform
them, are published in the minutes. If I have formed one overwhelming
impression from my years on the MPC it is of the importance of
individual accountability, and of the respect accorded to the integrity of
Members’ individual views among the staff of the Bank and within the
4

King (2004).

8

process itself. The individual accountability of members of the Monetary
Policy Committee is paramount. And the procedures originally
established by Governor George and the then Chief Economist, now
Governor, Mervyn King, respect and safeguard individual accountability.
You can see this in the influence individual members have on the
research agenda and the willingness of the staff to pursue minority
interests. You can see it in the complete absence of pressure to vote in a
particular way for, while issues are discussed in great depth, there is no
advance disclosure of voting intentions, no deals struck in cabals or
smoke-filled rooms (in fact since Sir Edward ceased to be Governor we
have had no smoke-filled rooms at all). And you can see it in the care the
Governor takes, as his predecessor did, always to be the last to give his
policy recommendation, after the rest of the Committee have spoken, so
as not to exercise any undue influence on the vote.
This is important. There is evidence that committees make better
decisions5, not just reflecting majority voting, but also because the
pooling of individual knowledge among committee members “means that
a group can be more than just the sum of its parts”6. Some commentators
have argued that dissent on the Monetary Policy Committee, as measured
by the frequency of split votes, appears to have diminished and that might
mean the Committee is less effective. But what appears to matter to the
effectiveness of committees is the exposure to a diversity of view, the
wide-ranging nature of discussion, the willingness to consider all
possibilities. The persistence or otherwise of minority voting tells us little
about the diversity of opinion expressed. Having disagreed with and
voted against the majority on the Committee, as I have on several
occasions, I have been happy to find that real engagement has enabled me
to vote with the majority again, at least for a while. Indeed two MPC

9

colleagues, Lomax (2005) and Lambert (2005), have noted the
importance of the lengthy discussion that takes place on the Committee in
formulating the Inflation Report projections, and indeed it appears that
Committee members are individually more likely to alter their views in
Inflation Report months, suggesting that the process has informed their
views7.
In fact the financial markets appear to recognise that the discussion can
be as informative as the vote. Analysis undertaken at the Bank of
England finds that on average the MPC Minutes contain as much news
for the financial markets when the vote is unanimous as when it is split8.
But it is important that both the Minutes and the Inflation Report
adequately reflect the breadth of debate and views on the Committee.
There can be many routes to the same conclusion. At least one observer
has suggested that concentration on the voting record might encourage
individual members to raise their profile by dissenting9. That would be
unfortunate.
It has been supposed that individual accountability might confuse the
clear communication of monetary policy. The Committee does not
coordinate a communications strategy. If we all speak at once it may tell
you something about the common pressures on our diaries, but not that
we have a strategy to get a collective message across. In any case
speeches are usually arranged too far in advance for that to be practicable.
To form expectations of the future course of interest rates, therefore,
observers need to understand the thinking not of one but of nine, and not
7

In her speech Rachel Lomax (Lomax,2005) showed that “since 2001, almost two thirds of rates
changes taking place in Inflation Report months, compared with the one third that would be expected if
rate changes were evenly spread over the year.” We can see a similar pattern in changes to the level of
interest rates that members individually voted for. On average, members changed the level of interest
rates they voted for 48% of the time in all Inflation Report meetings, compared to 37% of the time for
all meetings.

just on the central view but also on the attendant risks and uncertainties.
Might a multiplicity of voices speaking about monetary policy make it
harder to understand? In the early days of the Committee I had feared that
it might and that there might be a tension between individual
accountability and effective communication10.
So what are the features of a transparent monetary policy regime against
which the performance of the MPC can be assessed? First, there is
credibility. On this the current policy framework scores highly. After the
new framework was announced in 1997 inflation expectations in the
financial markets, which had generally exceeded the old target, quickly
came in line with the new target. See Chart 2. Expectations have
remained anchored at target since, suggesting that the new regime is more
credible than the old.
It might also be expected that movements in official interest rates would
be fully anticipated in a totally transparent monetary policy regime in
which the policymakers’ so-called “reaction function” was fully
understood. Although expectations of the future course of interest rates
would respond to economic developments, the public would know how
the policymakers would process the information and the interest rate
moves themselves would be anticipated. Monetary policy would indeed
be boring. However in an early study using data from January 1994 up to
June 1999 Clare and Courtney (2001) found little change in the market
reaction11 to interest rate announcements following independence. In
other words interest rate decisions appeared to still surprise as much after
independence as before. Lasaosa (2005) extended this study to June 2001
and found that not only could interest rate announcements still surprise
after 1997 but that macroeconomic data announcements surprised the

11

markets less in the post-independence period, and interest rate changes
about the same or more. This was the opposite of what might have been
expected. Moreover, at least up until mid-2001, it did not appear that
surprises were diminishing, as might have been expected had it taken the
markets time to learn how the new regime worked.
How should we make sense of this finding? Could this imply that the UK
regime is not so transparent and well understood after all? Or might there
be aspects of transparency which could raise the likelihood of surprises?
First, it should be noted that these studies compare data postindependence with the period 1994 to 1997, whereas in fact some aspects
of the current regime, such as an inflation target, publication of the
Inflation Report and the minutes of the (albeit very different) monetary
policy meeting were in place by 199412. Indeed Chart 313, which shows
the extent to which financial markets have been surprised by interest rate
decisions since 1986, appears to suggest that surprises had diminished by
1994 compared to the earlier period, although the extent of earlier
surprises might have been exaggerated in a less liquid market. Second,
Lasaosa (2005) uses data up to mid-2001 and it is possible that more
recent evidence taken from the last four years could show that the
incidence of surprises has diminished.
Moreover, in a forthcoming paper, Lavan Mahadeva of the External MPC
Unit shows that if monetary policy announcements contain new
information on the state of the economy, and hence the likely future
12

Important changes which were implemented since September 1992 were the quantification of an
inflation target in October 1992 by Chancellor Lamont; the publication of a quarterly Inflation Report
since February 1993; the formalisation of the role of the monthly meetings between the Governor and
the Chancellor; the publication of the minutes of these meetings; and the issuance of a press notice
outlining the reasons for the change. See, for example, Bowen (1995).
13
The data used are on the three-month LIBOR interest rate futures contracts traded on the London
International Financial Futures and options exchange (LIFFE). A three-month constant horizon implied
forward rate is derived from adjacent contracts by linear interpolation. The chart shows the daily (9am
to 6pm) surprise on days that the policy rate was changed since 1986. Rate changes were not always
implemented according to a pre-announced timetable of days or times for this period. Hence we use the
daily surprise.

12

stance of policy, then transparency might increase the extent to which
financial markets react to policy announcements. This might occur if the
policymakers are better placed to interpret what news means for inflation
and output, and for policy. Policy announcements would then act as a
beacon, helping the private sector understand the economic conjuncture.
This would suggest that we might expect the relative incidence of
surprises to have increased following Bank of England independence,
reflecting both the increased transparency of the decision-making process
and the role of experts in setting the policy rate.
In an attempt to understand the reasons for the persistence of surprises in
the new policy regime we have examined the events and market
behaviour leading up to the four occasions on which the financial markets
appear to have been most surprised by an interest rate announcement.
These are the occasions when the move in the implied three-month
interest rate three-months forward14 from 15 minutes before an interest
rate announcement to 45 minutes after it has been the largest. See Chart
4. The four occasions are June 1998, September 1999, August 2001 and
February 2003. In all cases it was a decision to change the official interest
rate that surprised, rather than an unexpected no-change decision and
longer dated expectations (for three-month interest rates six and twelve
months hence) also recorded significant moves, suggesting that the
interest rate surprise was more than simply one of the timing of a rate
move that was otherwise anticipated. The two most recent surprises were
in Inflation Report months, perhaps reflecting the intensity of the
Committee debate in those months.
All four surprises seem to have resulted from a difficulty in identifying
turning points. Three occurred well into the cycle, when many of the
economists surveyed by Reuters had thought that rates had already
14

See footnote 13.

13

peaked or troughed; in September 1999 it was the timing of the first
rate rise that surprised. The prevalence of surprises at turning points
would seem to be consistent with the rate decision having provided a
signal to help the private sector understand policy and interpret the
current conjuncture. Moreover, the Minutes of the meetings reveal that
several of the surprises seem to stem from an asymmetric interpretation
of economic data by the Committee and the private sector, which would
also suggest that the rate decisions played a role in signalling the
monetary policy implications of economic news. The Committee’s
concern about the strong average earnings figures in June 1998 is the
most striking example of this, but differences in interpretation of data also
appears to have played a role in the September 1999 and the August 2001
surprises.
None of the rate decisions were unanimous. But in all but one instance,
the previous month’s meeting had seen a minority voting for the move
made the following month15. This is consistent with Petra GerlachKristen’s finding that minority voting is informative about subsequent
interest rate moves16. However on two occasions there had been a threeway vote in the previous month, with a minority also voting for a move in
the opposite direction17. On each occasion there had been one or more
speeches, and also interviews, by MPC members in the month leading up
to the decision. On the first two occasions this included members who
didn’t support the rate move. On the last occasion, February 2003, a
speech by Governor George was incorrectly interpreted by some
observers as ruling out a cut. However, although this may have reinforced
prevailing interest rate expectations, there is no evidence from financial
market prices that this speech altered expectations. In the event, the

Governor voted with the majority in favour of a cut in rates. This
evidence suggests that a multiplicity of individually accountable voices
speaking in the period leading up to the interest rate decisions could have
led to a misinterpretation of the majority position and been a factor
contributing to the four interest rate surprises we have examined.

Conclusion
So it would seem that no matter how clear the MPC might be in
communicating, asymmetric information and knowledge will mean that
surprises cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover the complex nature of
the subject matter, the range of potential outturns, the risks and
uncertainties can militate against simplistic expressions of the outlook for
growth, inflation and interest rates.
The inevitable tension between the expression of individual opinion and
the expression of a clear message is another ingredient that can
complicate communication. But individual accountability is an important
factor in the strength of the current framework. It would be folly to
interfere with it. But it is important that the full range of argument and
diversity of opinion be expressed in the Minutes and the Inflation Report.
Financial markets and the media have shown that they have the
sophistication to deal with it. Of course, interviews and speeches can
further elucidate individual viewpoints. But the expression of an
individual view between meetings has to be regarded as just that – an
individual view.
What is clear, however, is that while individuals on the Committee may
differ on the outlook, the risks, or the policy implications, they all remain
committed to achievement of the inflation target. So you can be sure of

15

one thing; whatever the economic weather, there are nine individuals
committed to ensuring that CPI inflation stays close to 2%. That message
at least is simple.

from nominal and index-linked government bonds.
b) RPI is the measure of inflation used for index linked bonds, but is not the target measure for inflation
in the UK. RPI will differ from both RPIX and CPI. In part, these differences reflect the coverage of
the index. For example RPI includes mortgage interest payments. In addition, RPI will typically be
higher than CPI due to a formula effect, as the CPI uses a geometric mean rather than an arithmetic
mean to aggregate individual prices within each expenditure category.
