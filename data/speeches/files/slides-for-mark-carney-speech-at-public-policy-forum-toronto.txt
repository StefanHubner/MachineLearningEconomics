What has been done
Institution

Effect

Examples

Enabling institutions

Transformed the skill base of workers

Primary, secondary, tertiary and technical
education

New insurance institutions

Supported those displaced

Unemployment insurance, universal
healthcare, state pensions, child benefit

Labour market institutions

Influenced provisions and shared the surplus

Friendly Societies, Trade Unions, Cooperatives, minimum wages

Employers

Created environments to help employees
thrive

“Model Villages” (providing housing,
schooling and recreation), higher pay
(Ford’s $5 initiative), occupational
pensions

22

What could be done

First:
• Assess and address the skills gap
Then:
• Reduce frictions to applying new technologies

• Deepen Productivity and Creation effects
• Adapt all elements of market ecosystem
23

Business
• Identify skills mismatches and adopt anticipatory talent
management strategies
• More effective workforce training, as skill set of existing
employees is rate limiting factor of technology adoption
• Corporate re-training programmes for workers to be
retained by company and returned to workforce
• Providers of general purpose technologies explore
opportunities to maximise job-creating, augmented
intelligence
24

Labour market institutions
• Balance labour mobility with appropriate protections of
workers in new, non-standard jobs
• Taylor Review of modern working practices suggests people
working for platform-based companies be classed as
dependent contractors
• Embrace technology-enabled solutions to improve matching
and bridge skills gaps
• Enhance benefits and data portability (including reputational
histories of dependent contractors)
• Equalise incentives for human capital and physical investment
25

Enabling institutions
• Successive IRs developed primary, secondary and tertiary
education
• Could 4IR lead to quaternary education?
• Institutionalise re-training in mid-career
• Integrated with social welfare system
• Universal support schemes for retraining
• The UK’s Flexible Learning Fund
• Singapore’s SkillsFuture programme

26

Financial system
• New payment solutions for distributed commerce and realtime P2P transactions
• More effective, platform-based finance for SMEs
• Data-based financing for intangibles
• More efficient cross border transactions and trade finance
through better payments plumbing and robust digital IDs
• Expand impact investing to build social capital consistent
with new labour market
