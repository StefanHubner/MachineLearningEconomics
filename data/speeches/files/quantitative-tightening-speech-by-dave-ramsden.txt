Speech
Quantitative Tightening: the story so far
Thank you very much to the Money Macro and Finance Society for co-hosting this event
here at the Bank of England.
My remarks today are going to focus on the Bank of England’s experience of quantitative
tightening (QT). The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) set out its strategy for the mix of
monetary policy instruments to deliver tighter policy in the August 2021 Monetary Policy
Report (MPR), including the key principles that would underpin its approach to QT.1 Since
then, those principles have been put into practice with QT commencing in February 2022,
initially through maturities and augmented last autumn with a programme of gilt sales.
In September 2022, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts held in the Asset Purchase
Facility (APF) by £80 billion. By the end of September 2023, this will have reduced the size
of the total APF by 11.6% when including corporate bond sales. Alongside their decision,
the MPC committed to an annual review of the parameters of the QT programme, as part
of which it would set the pace for the reduction in the stock of gilts held in the APF for the
following twelve months.2
The review will inform the MPC’s decision on the pace of QT. That decision will be framed
by the MPC’s key principles; in particular, that QT is not the active tool for monetary policy.
The Committee has a preference to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting
the stance of monetary policy. For me this means that QT should be thought of as
operating in the background.
As we near the first such decision point, now is an appropriate time to reiterate the
principles underlying our approach to QT, to reflect on what we have learnt so far about
the impact of QT on the economy and financial markets and to consider any lessons.
Drawing on the work of Bank staff which is feeding into the review, I will offer my
perspectives on the future of the programme, including the pace of stock reduction next
year. To give my conclusion up front, I see potential to increase slightly the pace of gilt
stock reduction.
CPI Inflation at 7.9% in June remains much too high. Since December 2021, the
Committee have increased Bank Rate from 0.1% to 5% in order to ensure that inflation
returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. I will conclude my remarks with

some brief thoughts on the outlook for inflation and the potential implications for monetary
policy.
QT may be operating in the background in comparison to Bank Rate but it raises important
issues and is rightly subject to considerable interest and scrutiny. In telling the story on QT
so far, I hope to contribute to the understanding of QT.

QT in context – the growth of central bank balance sheets globally
To put that QT story in context, it is useful to reflect briefly on the quantitative easing (QE)
that preceded it and the resulting scale of central bank balance sheets globally.
Over the course of the past two decades, and especially since the onset of the global
financial crisis, QE was an important instrument of monetary policy for central banks,
including the Bank of England.34 QE was first launched in the UK in March 2009. With
Bank Rate having been cut to its then effective lower bound, the aim of QE was to lower
long-term interest rates, in order to boost economic activity and meet the inflation target in
the medium term. Over the decade that followed central banks in the UK and other
developed markets saw their balance sheets increase significantly in size.
In the UK, the stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes in the Bank’s APF peaked
at £895 billion towards the end of 2021 (Chart 1), following the implementation of further
QE in response to the Covid-19 crisis and its aftermath. The vast majority – £875 billion –
of these purchases were of UK government debt, amounting to around a third of the total
gilts in issue, and of annual UK GDP. The remainder of the MPC’s QE portfolio comprised
around £20 billion of UK corporate bonds.5

There is a growing body of work assessing the economic impact of QE, to which the Bank has contributed.
For a recent summary of QE at the Bank of England, see QE at the Bank of England: a perspective on its
functioning and effectiveness | Bank of England. The Bank’s approach to QE has also be assessed in
detail by the Bank’s Independent Evaluation Office: IEO evaluation of the Bank of England’s approach to
quantitative easing | Bank of England. MPC members have contributed through speeches –
Broadbent (2018, 2023), Ramsden (2021), Tenreyro (2023).
4 Global central banks also used other tools including the Funding for Lending Scheme and Term Funding
Scheme in the UK and the ECB TLTRO.
5 The Bank’s balance sheet is in practice even larger because of the size of drawings under the TFSME,
which peaked at £193bn in December 2021.

The APF is fully indemnified by HM Treasury, which ensures that monetary policy
decisions are not constrained by the potential implications for the Bank’s balance sheet.
The assets held in the APF generate a range of cash flows, which- alongside interest costs
and the gains or losses made at maturity or sale- have driven consequent cash transfers
between HMT and the APF.6
Between 2013 and end-September 2022, the APF transferred £124 billion to HMT under
this arrangement, but it was always recognised that reverse payments from HMT to the
APF were likely to be needed in the future as Bank Rate increased and the APF’s gilt
holdings were eventually unwound. Quarterly transfers from HMT to the APF have since
taken place in the last three quarters.

Asset purchases involve large flows of cash during the lifetime of the portfolio because of factors such as
income from coupon payments on the bonds held and interest paid on the loan used to fund them.

Where the cash position ends up is uncertain and dependent on a whole range of factors
including Bank Rate.7 But importantly, the MPC does not take into account financial risk or
profit when taking monetary policy decisions, including about the APF gilt portfolio.

QT in principle – the MPC’s key QT principles are designed to keep it in the
background
To ensure a smooth unwind of the APF gilt portfolio, the MPC set out its approach to QT in
the August 2021 MPR,8 which was based on three key principles designed to reduce its
impact and thus keep QT in the background; first the committee had a preference to use
Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy; second
sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets; and
third to help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a relatively gradual and predictable
manner over a period of time.
Key MPC principles for QT

In line with the MPC’s first principle, the Committee’s preference is to use Bank Rate as its
active instrument in most circumstances primarily because there is greater certainty, built
up over long experience, around how changes in Bank Rate affect the economy compared
with its other policy tools. Changes in Bank Rate can also be operationally easier and
quicker to implement.

Although QT is designed to operate in the background, it has the important benefit of
reducing the risk of a ratchet upwards in the size of the central bank balance sheet over
time, if successive policy cycles meet the effective lower bound on interest rates.9 That in
turn should increase the headroom and flexibility for the central bank to be able to use its
balance sheet in the future in pursuit of its monetary and financial stability remit, should
that be needed.

QT in practice – a clearly telegraphed, gradual and predictable approach
The process of reducing the stock of assets held in the APF began following the
February 2022 MPC meeting when Bank Rate reached 0.5%. The MPC began QT before
either the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank.
Consistent with the principle that APF unwind is gradual and predictable, the MPC began
by ceasing reinvestment of maturities from its stock of both government and
investment-grade corporate bonds.
At the February 2022 meeting, the Committee asked the Bank to design a programme for
the sale of the £20 billion corporate bond portfolio held in the APF. The subsequent
Market Notice announcing the sales programme was published in May.10 These sales
were completed within a year, earlier than anticipated, and with little impact on market
functioning. I will return to this later in my speech.
The MPC set out our approach to gilt sales alongside the August 2022 monetary policy
decision. This restated our three key principles and set an indicative £80 billion stock
reduction target, which included both maturities and sales, for the 12 months from October
2022. This was in order to allow the market sufficient time to prepare for participation in the
Bank’s operations.
We have designed our approach to QT carefully in the context of the MPC’s three key
principles. As my colleague Andrew Hauser set out in a speech in November,11 we have
achieved that in four ways.
First, as discussed above, the MPC adopted a progressive and clearly telegraphed
approach to developing and communicating its unwind programme, which seeks to leave
Bank Rate as the active instrument for policy.

Second, the operational delivery of sales can be adjusted in light of market conditions. The
MPC set a high bar for amending its annual target for the reduction in the stock of
purchased gilts outside of the schedule annual review. But the MPC did grant discretion to
Bank Executive to adjust the operational delivery of QT if market conditions warranted it.12
In light of a significant repricing of UK and global financial assets in late September 2022,
Bank staff postponed the beginning of gilt sale operations until 1 November. When those
sales began, we also varied the gilts made available for sale, by temporarily delaying the
sale of the longer tenor gilts that were at the centre of the crisis until Q1 2023. This was
positively received by market participants at the time.
Third, Bank staff have designed sales to work with the grain of the market, wherever
possible. We are selling bonds through a set of frequent, modestly sized auctions set out
in advance through a quarterly calendar of operations. As the Governor set out in an
exchange of letters with the Chancellor in February 2022,13 the Bank has been liaising with
the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) in order to minimise interference with the DMO’s
own issuance programme and to try to ensure sufficient gaps between supply events of
the same maturity.14 This coordination has worked effectively and has been a key element
in ensuring the QT programme is consistent with the MPC’s principles
And fourth, the Bank has introduced a new Short Term Repo (STR) facility to ensure that
QT does not put undue upwards pressure on short-term money market rates.15 As assets
held in the APF mature, or are sold back to the market, the reserves used to fund those
purchases will be extinguished. Once the level of reserves falls below that required by
commercial banks to meet their payments obligations and broader liquidity needs, absent
any action from us, banks would start trying to borrow reserves in money markets, causing
short-term interest rates to rise significantly. Our current thinking is that this point of
reserves scarcity still lies some years away, but that is highly uncertain. We have therefore
introduced the STR as an alternative source of reserves for commercial banks, should it
be needed. That has been operating since October 2022 and is designed to be freely used
from the start.16

markets, and intends that is should be seen as such by bank boards and overseas regulators. See PRA

Taken together, these four elements have helped the Bank conduct the MPC’s QT
programme in a way which should minimise the potential for its impact on gilt yields and on
financial markets.

Gilt quantitative tightening – limited impact on gilt yields
Precisely because of the way QT is designed to work in the background, it is difficult to
measure its impact with any certainty. It also remains early days. Nevertheless, we are
continually assessing the emerging evidence.
While QT is, in theory, the opposite of QE, we have always stressed the state contingency
of the associated transmission channels. Moreover, the MPC’s approach to QT effectively
turns off some of the channels that were important during QE, exploiting this state
contingency.17 First, in line with our key principle that Bank Rate is the active tool, the MPC
is not using QT to signal the future path of Bank Rate and so materially change
expectations of policy rates, so there is no so-called ‘signalling channel’. Second, by
conducting QT carefully when market conditions are not stressed, the liquidity and market
function channels of QE are likely to be minimised during QT.
The empirical evidence we have so far supports the theory: the overall impact of QT on gilt
yields appears to have been small.
That is particularly the case in the context of the very much larger developments in the
outlook for our active policy tool, Bank Rate. To illustrate that, Chart 2 shows that the vast
majority of the ~300bps increase in UK 10-year gilt yields since February 2022 (when
maturing gilts stopped being reinvested) has been driven by increases in expected policy
rates. As discussed above, our QT strategy contains no upward signal on the path of
rates. Instead, the key driver of yields over this period has been the evolving outlook for
inflation and hence the expected path for Bank Rate.

(a) The chart uses estimates from a range of internal models of UK term premia to split the 10y gilt yield into
expected rates and term premia contributions. Expected rates reflect investors’ expectations of the average
short-term monetary policy rate over the next 10 years, and term premium is defined as the additional
compensation investors demand to hold a longer-term bond relative to a series of shorter-term bonds.
Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P, Tradeweb and Bank calculations

In contrast, we estimate that term premia have increased by only around 40bps in the
period since QT began. QT may of course be one contributing factor to this much smaller
component – for example, any portfolio balance channel of QT would be expected to show
up in the term premia. But QT is unlikely to be the major driver of this component either.
Term premia will also reflect the increase in uncertainty around the outlook for the
economy and rates and also the material increase in DMO issuance.
Our market intelligence suggests that QT, while likely having some impact on yields, has
had a relatively small role to play. For example, in the June 2022 Market Participants
Survey, conducted by the Bank, the median respondent reported that QT expectations had
pushed up UK gilt yields by 10bps for the UK 10 year gilt and ongoing market intelligence
conversations suggests that the impact on yields remains small.
Consistent with the view that QT should not be operating via liquidity and market
functioning channels, event study estimates suggest a limited impact around QT auctions.
As an illustration, Chart 3 shows the average absolute intraday range in gilt yields across
a range of maturities separated into the 37 QT auction and remaining non-auction days
since the sales programme started last November. If the ongoing flow of QT sales was
having a significant effect on yields, you might expect to see larger moves on QT auction
days, but that is not the case.

that moves in swap spreads and curve steepness measures have not been unusual on QT
auction days relative to other days.

The limited QT-related flow effects observed around auctions so far would be consistent
with markets having largely priced in any QT impacts well ahead of time – or alternatively,
that the overall impact is just very small. This is, of course, entirely in line with the MPC’s
approach given the principle that QT should be gradual and predictable.
Since the sales programme commenced in November 2022, the Bank has sold
£26.54 billion of gilts in sales proceeds terms. The Bank has announced £7.11 billion of
sales in Q3 to deliver the MPC’s £80 billion target, based on the market value of APF gilt
holdings.
Overall, the evidence to date supports our expectation that QT effects on gilt yields, while
greater than zero, appear to be materially smaller than the effects of QE. Given our
experience so far, as a very rough indication of scale, Bank staff estimate that a one-off
additional £80 billion of QT relative to expectations is likely to increase 10 year gilt yields
by less than 10 bps in prevailing market conditions. Based on our experience of QE, that
would map across into an impact on activity and inflation of less than 0.2% and 0.1pp
respectively.
These small numbers are welcome. The MPC’s key principles have been designed exactly
to support a relatively small economic impact from QT, such that it can proceed as a
process in the background.
Importantly, to the extent any QT impacts – while relatively small – are coming through,
the MPC will have observed the associated effects on asset prices, conditioned its
forecasts accordingly and has full flexibility to adjust its active tool – Bank Rate – to the
extent that any offsetting action is deemed necessary. Given the limited evidence for QT
impact to date, particularly in the context of the other large shocks to the economic
outlook, from my perspective QT has not had a bearing in determining my votes on
Bank Rate since the QT programme commenced.

QT operations – mindful of market function
Bank staff are constantly monitoring market liquidity and functioning, drawing on a
combination of market intelligence and data analytics.18 Dedicated market intelligence
teams speak to a broad set of market participants about conditions in the gilt market and
broader UK-relevant financial markets. We combine this with a wide range of quantitative
indicators on market liquidity, including indicators based on transaction-level data. As
already stressed, the Bank’s QT operations are designed to operate in the background.
Based on our experience to date and in line with the second of the MPC’s key principles,

See Navigating market signals: MaPS for policy makers – remarks by Andrea Rosen | Bank of
England

Page 12

we have found no evidence that our operations have themselves disrupted market
functioning.
First, some context. As already flagged and covered in detail elsewhere, market conditions
deteriorated rapidly in late September 2022.19 Metrics of gilt market illiquidity spiked,
reaching similar levels to the 2020 ‘dash for cash’ (Chart 5).

Conditions did improve in late 2022 and into the New Year, before deteriorating somewhat
following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March and the associated increase in
volatility. Liquidity conditions have since improved overall. Some metrics remain somewhat
higher than their average over previous years, but this is broadly as expected in the
context of the higher level of volatility (Chart 6).

Looking over the first eight months of sales, the impact of our auctions appears to have
been small and our operations have not disrupted market functioning. As I noted earlier,
yield moves on auction days do not look materially different to non-auction days. And
liquidity metrics look no worse on QT auction days (Chart 7).

The auctions themselves have been well absorbed by the market so far, with an average
bid-to-cover ratio of just over two, that is we generally get twice the value of bids than the
size of each operation (Chart 8).

As well as avoiding harming market functioning, there is some evidence that our QT sales
have had an additional positive effect on the gilt market. Over the first half of 2022, we saw
signs of scarcity of short-dated bonds in particular, driven by increased demand for
collateral. You can see that by looking at the ‘specialness’ of these bonds in repo markets
– that is, how far away secured borrowing rates on specific bonds are from a general
secured borrowing rate. As shown in Chart 9, this repo specialness became more acute in
early 2022. That was not just a UK story – a similar effect was seen in short-dated German
government bonds. This scarcity was also evident in the difference between swap rates
and bond yields – the swap spread – and in how dispersed bond yields were from a fitted
yield curve (yield curve ‘noise’).

Since we started selling bonds through QT this scarcity effect has alleviated, especially at
short maturities. For these bonds, repo specialness has reduced, swap spreads have
fallen (Chart 10) and yield curve dispersion has ticked down.

Of course, QT is only one factor in driving these developments- the DMO has also been
issuing short dated bonds, and demand for collateral has reduced since last year.
However, in returning particularly scarce short-dated collateral to the market, QT sales do
seem to have played a role, an emerging feature that is supported by our market
intelligence.
Taking all market intelligence evidence together so far, QT sales auctions have operated
in line with expectations since sales started in November 2022.

Corporate bond sales - successfully completed ahead of schedule
As a final point on the market’s capacity for digesting QT, I will note the successful wind
down of the corporate bond portfolio held in the APF. The size of the corporate bond
portfolio, which was added to the APF by the MPC from August 2016, peaked at £20
billion. Noting that the impact on monetary conditions at a time when markets were
functioning relatively normally was likely to be small, the MPC ceased reinvestment of the
CBPS in February 2022, with the Bank commencing sales from the portfolio in September
2022.

This process went well. Our sales operations were designed to be responsive to market
demand and we sold the corporate bond portfolio ahead of target. Sales were completed
on 6 June 2023, well ahead of the initially expected pace (Chart 11). A small number of
very short maturity bonds will continue to be held in the portfolio, maturing fully by
5 April 2024.

What have we learned so far and what is next?
The framing for the MPC decision on QT for the next 12-month period is to balance the
reduced uncertainty from our experience to date alongside the market backdrop. QT sales
auctions have operated as intended so far through this period. The MPC will take into
account market functioning, our view of which will be updated throughout the summer,
when it makes its decision on pace for the twelve months from October 2023 to September
2024.
In advance of that decision, I think the story is “so far, so good”. Our QT programme
continues to operate in the background. It is having only a limited impact on gilt yields, all
else equal. Market liquidity has declined somewhat over the past 18 months, in line with
heightened macro volatility, but it has improved substantially since autumn 2022. There
has been no discernible impact from our sales operations on market liquidity, and indeed,
there have been some signs that our sales may have helped alleviate collateral scarcity
somewhat.
We can of course never be complacent, and will continue to monitor market functioning
closely. But so far, this has all been achieved by applying the three key principles for QT
that the MPC set out almost two years ago.
There are three things the MPC could weight as it makes its upcoming decision.
First, when we decided on the initial £80 billion pace of unwind last September; we had no
direct evidence on how sales would affect financial markets. The MPC incorporated this
uncertainty into its initial decision on pace. From my perspective, I saw this as aiming
under somewhat in order to incorporate a degree of ‘learning by doing’. The MPC has
learned more about the economic and market impact of QT since then, with reassuring
signs so far.
Second, we know more about the intermediation capacity of market participants. The pace
of gilt sales from the APF into the market has generally been successfully absorbed by the
market to date, including as gilt supply from the DMO has increased materially, and has
had the added advantage of returning scarce collateral to the market. Given that, it seems
reasonable for sales to continue at this pace for the next twelve-month period.
Third, when making its decision for the next twelve-month period, the MPC will be
conscious that as well as the £80 billion reduction in the stock of gilts this year, the
reduction in the overall APF over this period included the additional successful sale of the

£20 billion corporate bond portfolio. 20 As Chart 12 shows, the total decline in the APF in
the year from last October will amount to some £100 billion.

Taken together, for me personally, these factors support a carefully considered increase in
the pace of reduction in the stock of gilts in the twelve months ahead reflecting: the
completion of the CBPS unwind; the reduced need for aiming off for learning; and
evidence so far on marketing functioning. I emphasise careful –like the MPC I want QT to
set a gradual and predictable pace for unwind and to let it operate in the background, after
all.
The MPC’s focus is on total stock reduction. But the underlying components for QT also
matter. The higher maturities from the APF in the twelve months from October 2023 to
September 2024 as shown in Chart 12 mean that it is possible to increase slightly the
overall pace of gilt stock reduction to more than the £80 billion achieved over 2022-23,
while at the same time keeping the amount of sales that the market must intermediate
broadly unchanged.
The MPC will announce its decision on pace ahead of it taking effect at the start of
October. Bank staff will continue their regular market monitoring ahead of that point. And
the MPC will be drawing on the full range of data and market intelligence available to it
when taking its decision.

In addition, the Bank successfully completed its sales of the £19.3bn portfolio of temporary holdings of UK
government bonds purchased in Autumn 2022 on financial stability grounds.

Further out, it bears restating that this is an annual process. We continue to learn as we go
and will take next year’s decision with another full year of data and experience. The size of
maturing gilts in the APF will increase again in 2024-25, and the MPC will have to return to
the issue of the pace of stock reduction when its next reviews its QT programme.

Returning to the active tool…
In August, the MPC will decide on the stance of monetary policy, based on its active
monetary policy tool- Bank Rate. This decision will be framed by updated economic
forecasts in the August MPR.
In the last MPR forecast published in May, the MPC highlighted that it expected headline
CPI to fall sharply from April 2023 onwards as energy prices ease. That is what we have
seen since, with CPI inflation falling from 10.1% in March to 8.7% in April and to 7.9% in
June.
CPI inflation has begun to fall significantly but remains much too high. The MPC has
consistently stressed that monetary policy decisions will address the risk of more
persistent strength in domestic wage and price settling. This was represented by the
upward skew in the projected distribution on CPI inflation in the May forecast.
At the subsequent June meeting, the MPC recognised that the second-round effects in
domestic price and wage developments generated by external cost shocks were likely to
take longer to unwind than they had done to emerge. There had been significant upside
news in data up to the June meeting that suggested more persistence in the inflation
process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in
demand. Some indicators of future pay growth and goods inflation had weakened, but their
properties as leading indicators had not been tested in a similar period of high inflation.
The scale of the upside surprises in official estimates of wage growth and services CPI
inflation suggested a 50bps increase in interest rates to 5% was required at that particular
meeting in order to return inflation to the 2% percent target sustainably in the medium
term.
I am not going to comment on the detail of the data published since the June meeting. The
August MPC round starts soon and will be completed with our announcement on 3 August.
What I do want to emphasise as my conclusion is that the MPC will continue to monitor
closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole,
including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and
services price inflation. If there is evidence of more persistent pressures, then further
tightening in monetary policy would be required.
