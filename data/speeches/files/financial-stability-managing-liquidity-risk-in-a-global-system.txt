1. Introduction
Much is written today about the search for yield. Much is said about the factors that
underlie it: accommodative monetary policy; savings gluts; and financial engineering
which multiplies the opportunities for increasing leverage. And much, too, is said about
new instruments, such as those involving credit risk transfer, or new players, such as
hedge funds, that trade them.
However, my main concern today is not with the search for yield as such, nor with market
innovations or new players. Rather, it is with the financial vulnerabilities to which they
could give rise, and what can be done to mitigate those vulnerabilities.
Because it seems to me that the search for yield also highlights some less benign aspects
of today’s financial system: the opacity of markets in some new instruments; the
difficulty of knowing the real value of assets and contracts; reliance on models that have
not been tested in the full range of economic conditions; the uncertainties over behaviour
of new participants in the markets should events turn adverse; and the difficulty we have
in judging just how deep markets will prove to be should a substantial number of
investors decide simultaneously to try to realise their investments.
On a more practical level, there is no lack of evidence that things can and do go wrong.
We have recently seen lack of operational discipline in some financial markets leading to
documentation backlogs and to uncertainty over the enforceability of transfer of risks. We
see more relaxed lending criteria in the LBO market, increased reliance on potentially
illiquid instruments in trading strategies, and questionable quality of some IPO’s. We
have seen specific examples of significant downgrades or outright failures such as
GM/Ford, AHBR and, more recently, Refco and Delphi.
One reaction to these episodes is that they show the market doing its work and are
testimony to the effectiveness of market discipline. The fact that the financial system has
coped with these problems may well also be testimony to the strengths of that system.
On the other hand, might not these episodes be a potential sign that all is not well? The
question is: are vulnerabilities mounting, and will they one day crystallise when a bigger
shock arrives that the market simply cannot absorb?
The fact is, we just don’t know. And that is why we need to be particularly vigilant.

4
Such questions lead me to think about issues relating to liquidity. If a period of market
stress materialises, triggered by a sharp snap back in prices, it is critical that the financial
system should be able to meet a temporary increase in the demand for cash without
precipitating, in the vernacular, a ‘market meltdown’. Liquidity is therefore the focus of
my remarks today. By liquidity I mean two things. First, institutional liquidity: the
continued ability of individual financial institutions to meet claims as they fall due. And
second, market liquidity: the depth of markets for the sale or loan of assets or the hedging
of the risks that underlie those assets.
To set the scene, it is perhaps worth reflecting on how liquidity needs and processes may
amplify the risks of instability—that is, their ability, in stressed conditions, to disrupt the
functioning of the financial system generally, and the banking and payment systems
specifically.
The traditional route arises from the banking system’s role in maturity transformation
between short term deposits and long term loans. Managing this mismatch whilst
maintaining the confidence of depositors is the essence of the business of banking.
However, the presence of this maturity mismatch means that individual banks are by their
nature fragile. The connections between banks, and the potential for doubts about one
bank to spread to others, mean that the failure of one bank to manage its mismatch can
potentially put at risk the financial system more widely. Bagehot in 1873 summed up this
link between maturity mismatch and systemic risk:
‘Of the many millions in Lombard Street, infinitely the greater proportion
is held by bankers or others on short notice or on demand; that is to say,
the owners could ask for it all any day they please: in a panic some of
them do ask for some of it. If any large fraction of that money really was
demanded, our banking system and our industrial system would be in
great danger.’
In Bagehot’s time, the role of the Bank of England was to act as guardian of the reserve
of bullion that underpinned the credibility of the whole banking system. The technology
may have changed, but in essence the role of the Bank today is one that Bagehot would
recognize. Central bank money is the ultimate settlement asset. And banks still
demonstrate their ability to meet depositors’ demands for repayment by holding a

5
sufficient stock of high quality securities against which central banks—and in normal
circumstances the markets—will lend. Confidence in the modern financial system is
therefore underpinned by the preparedness of central banks to lend against such high
quality security without question.
Central banks have, therefore, a keen interest in developments that affect the demand for
and supply of liquidity. It is not surprising that they try to limit the likelihood of events
that might lead to excessive increases in demand for liquidity or constraints on its supply,
and also try to have in place the operational apparatus to respond to such developments, if
felt necessary, at minimum cost.
The traditional sources of liquidity risk for banks are unusually heavy demands from
depositors for repayment and from their customers to draw down pre-committed funding.
Today’s environment encourages us also to recognise disruption to markets as a potential
trigger for such extraordinary demand. If you think about the expansion of markets in
which banks participate, both as principals and as intermediaries, and the fact that at times
of stress investors would be likely to place a premium on “safe” assets and ultimately on
cash, then it soon gets you back to thinking about the robustness of arrangements that
enable banks to satisfy unexpected spikes in cash demand, perhaps in unexpected
locations. Markets rely on this in order for them to function with confidence.
2. How has the world changed?
I said that Bagehot would recognise the modern role of central banks. However, the firms
that comprise the financial system are much altered since his day. So I should like to
make a few observations both about how this has affected firms’ own liquidity
management, and crucially how the public authorities might react.
Firstly, concentration in the global financial system has increased, with a relatively small
number of global firms—banks and non-banks—representing a significant fraction of the
system. These firms often employ centralized liquidity management. And they are
increasingly strongly interconnected, within and across borders, and via new markets for
risk transfer as well as more traditional channels. Participation in risk transfer markets
does more than just create new links between firms: it also creates a new potential
demand on firms’ liquidity in the form of margin calls. Moreover, this additional demand

6
may be positively correlated with other liquidity risk that firms face in the event of
market stress.
Secondly, there are certain features of the prevailing financial and economic environment
that give us pause for thought. Market prices are at historically unusual levels: real and
nominal returns on risk free assets are low and credit spreads are tight, both in traditional
and structured products. It is of course hard to say definitively the extent to which today’s
markets are merely reflecting changed fundamentals. But it is quite possible that some
investors have unwittingly taken on higher levels of risk in pursuit of what they would
consider to be “normal” levels of return. And it is certainly prudent to plan for the
possibility of a sharp reversion of prices to historically more normal levels (or even
beyond them, given the tendency of markets to overshoot). There could be a period of
impaired market liquidity during any such correction. One could imagine a number of
potential catalysts for such a correction, ranging from a geo-political event to some form
of major operational disruption.
The Bank concurs with the widely held view that the growth of markets in risk transfer
should contribute to greater financial stability, by allowing a more efficient dispersion of
risks. But the depth and reliability of the more recently developed markets in risk under
stressed conditions has not yet been fully tested. Moreover, risk transfer markets can, and
probably at present do make the ultimate destination of risks more opaque. This hampers
our ability to assess the overall stability of the financial system, and, potentially, to react
effectively in a crisis.
3. How have firms reacted to these changes?
The banking industry has, not surprisingly, responded to these changes by paying greater
attention to liquidity risk management. And, as well as day-to-day management, banks
have given more consideration to how they would cope with extreme or ‘tail’ events.
Banks have developed, or are at least in the process of developing, sophisticated scenario
analyses, and are assessing the contingency arrangements that would be required to
respond to these scenarios. It is certainly encouraging to observe the determination with
which many banks are addressing liquidity risk, and it is at the same time noteworthy how
efficiency drivers have led many banking groups to take a more centralised approach to
liquidity management.

7
But, despite the progress that banks are making in addressing liquidity risk, the
framework that underpins their contingency plans makes a number of assumptions,
particularly regarding access to funding markets. There seems, for example, to be a
widespread view that, whatever has happened to a firm’s access to wholesale unsecured
funding, it will be able to borrow secured against good collateral. Lying behind this is
probably an expectation that national authorities, and in particular central banks, will be
ready to provide liquidity against good collateral in the event of the failure of one or more
of the markets for secured borrowing.
Banks are also giving greater thought to the impact of an extreme event on the value of
collateral and the proportion of that value that can be borrowed, as well as the sale value
of any assets that they might consider liquidating. The assumptions here might prove to
be optimistic particularly in circumstances such as those seen in 1998, when extreme
events led to one-way markets and a vicious circle in which asset price falls did not lead
to increased demand but rather to further increases in supply. It is for reasons such as
these that the contingency planning that firms put in place needs to be sufficient.
Banks have also placed increased emphasis on identifying potential sources of liquidity
shocks. Products which entail the posting of margin, such as derivatives, can result in
significant calls on liquidity.
4. Policy Responses
So what gaps does this leave, and what policy responses are therefore needed on top of
firms’ own actions? There is scope for further work by the private sector on improving
liquidity risk management. But there are also a number of issues for public authorities to
address.
The preparations that firms make are influenced by regulation. When balancing the costs
and benefits of measures to mitigate risk, banks naturally have regard to the interests of
their own shareholders. But one of the roles of, and indeed justifications for, regulation is
to ensure that firms also take sufficient account of the interests of others who would be
adversely affected by their failure: their own borrowers and depositors, for example, but
also the customers of other banks that would suffer losses if a particular bank were to get
into difficulties. In other words, one purpose of regulation is to align private choices with
public welfare maximisation.

8
Hitherto, public authorities have placed much emphasis on capital requirements as a way
of achieving this reconciliation. Indeed, one reason for imposing capital requirements is
to limit the risk of liquidity problems, by giving the market a level of assurance over the
solvency of a firm. But this emphasis on capital has perhaps overshadowed the
importance of direct liquidity requirements. Analytically, liquidity is a more difficult area.
But arguably the case for prudential liquidity requirements in some form is just as strong
as for capital. Liquidity cushions are a first line of defence: in times of stress they can buy
time, and where organisations are solvent they can help to prevent liquidity problems
turning into solvency ones. I will return to this later.
But besides regulation, the public authorities—specifically central banks—have a crucial
role as the ultimate providers of liquidity. They therefore need to ensure that they are
properly equipped to carry out this function.
Avoiding or resolving liquidity problems is not just a matter of ensuring adequate
aggregate liquidity; it also means ensuring that liquidity can be, and is, distributed
effectively round the system. This was illustrated by the events of 9/11, when the US
money market was temporarily unable to distribute liquidity to the banks that needed it.
On that occasion, for example, the Federal Reserve injected considerable liquidity, more
than $100bn, via a combination of daylight overdrafts, discount window lending, and
general market support. 9/11 also highlighted the importance of central banks being able
to lend directly to solvent institutions facing a liquidity crisis. Under stressed conditions,
and with the associated uncertainties, attempts by a perfectly sound bank to borrow
unusually large amounts from the market, even against good quality collateral, have the
potential to raise, or exacerbate, doubts about that bank’s solvency. But a solvent bank
that is in need of liquidity can safely reveal its need to the central bank without
precipitating a crisis in market confidence; uniquely, the latter is not at risk of
experiencing a run, and so will not overreact in an effort to protect its own balance sheet.
In many countries ‘automatic’ direct liquidity provision against pre-defined acceptable
collateral is hard-wired into the operational framework for monetary policy
implementation through so-called ‘standing facilities’. In the UK we are broadening the
range of firms to whom we can supply liquidity in this way. This implements Bagehot’s
prescription for mitigating systemic risk, that the central bank should as far as possible

9
make clear in advance its preparedness to provide liquidity in stressed conditions.
Referring to the central bank, he puts it thus:
‘The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their
own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others.
They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to “this man and that
man”, whenever the security is good.’
The picture becomes more complex in the case of global firms that manage liquidity
centrally. Such firms have liquidity needs in multiple currencies and locations. They may
find it costly to hold enough liquid assets in every market in which they operate, and
hence potentially face a mismatch between the location of their liquidity needs and that of
their liquid assets.
In response to this several central banks, notably those in Switzerland, Sweden, the UK,
and the United States, have taken steps to allow the cross-border use of collateral in some
or all of their routine lending activities. Others have taken the alternative route of
attempting to reduce collateral costs for banks, and hence relax potential constraints, by
accepting a range of less liquid and non-marketable assets, while still controlling the
credit quality of the assets involved. For example, the Eurosystem accepts a wide range of
non-sovereign debt securities, including corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. The
European Central Bank’s proposed ‘Single List’ will also include certain bank loans;
indeed these are already eligible in some member countries. Similarly, the Fed has
broadened the range of collateral accepted at the Discount Window.
A working group commissioned by the Basel-based CPSS (Committee on Payment and
Settlement Systems) in 2004 has examined whether existing arrangements would prove
adequate in an emergency. It would appear that some of the infrastructure required to
facilitate more extensive cross-border use of collateral is already in place: links between
securities settlement systems, for example. Nevertheless, central banks may need to put in
place more cooperative and coordinated policies, such as the establishment of a
framework for information-sharing.
When risks do crystallise it is imperative that central banks, along with regulators and
ministries of finance, are well prepared so that they are able to respond in an effective
manner. The CPSS working group looked at preparations that are needed in order to be

10
able to make effective use of existing infrastructure in a crisis. But it is equally important
that central banks and regulators be in a position to make the decisions necessary for
resolution of a crisis, both individually and, when needed, collectively.
This entails gathering data and intelligence on firms and markets, sharing it appropriately
amongst all relevant public authorities, understanding the systemic conjuncture, and
setting up national and international frameworks for coordination of decision making. I
could give an entire speech about questions in these areas, and current and potential
initiatives to address them1. However, today I would like to return instead to the subject
of liquidity regulation.

1

One important pre-requisite is that the authorities have access to up-to-date and accurate information

about financial firms, on which they can base shared assessments of the position of individual firms and the
likelihood of a crisis affecting the financial system as a whole. The information needed includes, inter alia,
a firm’s group structure, capital, liquidity asset holdings, large exposures, and its involvement in markets
and in payment, clearing and settlement systems. This information can be collectively thought of as a
‘Fact Book’ on a firm. In some countries much of this information is already available. The FSA recently
published a paper outlining the information that the UK authorities collectively deem it necessary to have in
a financial crisis, and asking for firms’ cooperation in making available a limited amount of additional
information that is not already collected on a routine basis.
We also obtain a great deal of additional information in the course of our own market operations, through
our involvement in payment systems and other infrastructure, through our counterparties and contacts, and
in other ways. Intelligence of this sort allows us to understand the environment—the products, techniques,
and markets—in which firms operate and how they and the markets in which they trade may behave in
times of stress. It therefore supports analysis of how stress might spread and how the authorities can most
effectively respond; and it helps to identify the appropriate channels for communicating this response. But
analysis from intelligence can also provide early warning of symptoms of actual or incipient stress; for
example, a high degree of leverage coupled with crowded trades in markets that can be illiquid.
The authorities then have time, where appropriate, to publicise any concerns so that firms can take action to
prevent the risks from crystallising, and factor them into stress tests and scenario analysis. We provide such
analysis regularly in our Financial Stability Review. And were a crisis to develop, an understanding of the
‘systemic conjuncture’ is also required to enable the authorities to assess on a continuing basis the likely
systemic impact, and to choose an appropriate policy response.
As well as information exchange, strong co-ordination of decision making between central banks,
regulators, and ministries of finance, is likely to be essential for effective crisis management. This is true
both at a domestic and an international level. A first step is for the relevant national authorities to have
clear, well established, processes for decision making and for communicating externally, and to ensure that

11
The potential willingness of the authorities to supply discretionary—as opposed to
routine—liquidity in a crisis is likely to give rise to moral hazard, because in the real
world, faced with incomplete information, it is difficult or impossible to identify ex ante a
‘pure’ liquidity crisis. By, for example, relaxing normal criteria on collateral quality
authorities may move from the injection of liquidity to what is effectively the provision of
risk capital. Firms may then be inclined to tailor their risk-taking to their own assessment
of the probability of intervention, while at the same time the incentive for firms to hold
adequate buffers of liquid assets is likely to be reduced. The gap between the amount of
liquidity that a firm will choose to hold, and the optimal public choice will then widen. It
is not surprising, then, that in most jurisdictions firms’ liquidity management is subject to
standards imposed by regulation.
Intervening in this way requires that the authorities be able to answer some difficult
questions. There is the question of calibration: how much liquidity is ‘enough’ for any
given firm? In other words, what is the optimal public choice of liquidity buffer? And for
how long should a firm be expected to be able to survive without outside help? This is a
much more difficult question for liquidity buffers than for capital, as in the case of
liquidity it is not sufficient merely to analyse the structure of a firm’s assets and
liabilities. The firm also has to take account of the possible ways in which its
counterparties and creditors may behave in a crisis. Moreover, in a liquidity crisis, there is
feedback from the actions that a firm takes to meet liquidity needs—selling assets for
example—to the market’s perception of its solvency and hence to the size of those very
liquidity needs. Furthermore, it is arguable that buffers should vary to some extent with
these processes are well understood by all parties. In the UK, HMT, the Bank and the FSA have a published
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), established in 1997, which sets out a high-level framework for cooperation in the field of financial stability.
Although there is no such agreement at an international level at an equivalent level of detail, a
‘Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation between banking regulators, central banks, and finance
ministries of the European Union in Financial Crisis Situations’ was signed earlier this year. It is fair to say,
however, that this represents only a first step.
Finally, if the authorities decide to take measures to mitigate the systemic impact of a crisis—for example
through emergency liquidity injection of one sort or another—it is vital that the central bank, supervisor and
ministry of finance act, and are seen to act, in a decisive and joined up way. In the UK, the MOU provides
for strategic management of a crisis at meetings of a ‘Standing Committee’, the members of which are
senior representatives of HMT (who chair the meetings), the Bank, and the FSA.

12
the level of risk that a firm brings to the financial system. Firms that, for example, are
relatively large or opaque, or have more extensive connections to other parts of the
financial system might be expected to meet higher standards under such a regime.
The impact of liquidity standards on a firm’s relationship with its central bank, both in
normal times and in crisis, also has to be considered. In many countries, the UK included,
firms need to obtain central bank money in order to make payments to other banks in the
real time gross settlement system and to settle delivery versus payment securities
transactions. The ability to obtain central bank money—liquidity—depends at all times on
having access to sufficient quantities of high quality collateral. And such collateral is of
course amongst the best forms of insurance against liquidity problems. So the extent to
which prudential liquidity standards require firms to hold collateral, and the precise way
in such requirements are calibrated, have a direct impact on the economics of their
participation in payment systems and in central bank operations to implement monetary
policy.
The structural and conjunctural developments that I described earlier are most material to
these questions. On calibration, for example, greater inter-linkages between firms mean
that the external costs of failure—the costs that are not borne by the firm itself and are
therefore unlikely to be taken into account in its own planning—are greater. If markets on
which firms now rely for some of their liquidity became fragile, then, all else being equal,
firms would be more vulnerable to liquidity problems.
This argues for the authorities in all jurisdictions to review whether the liquidity standards
that they currently impose are still appropriate, given the nature of firms and their
activities. But globalization also means that there is a case to look again at consistency of
liquidity standards across jurisdictions. As central banks or regulators we are each
seeking to achieve a high level of soundness in our respective financial systems. But the
soundness of any of the global firms that are a major part of those systems is a function of
the standards imposed on the group and its major subsidiaries in many jurisdictions.
None of this necessarily argues for full harmonization of liquidity standards in the way
that capital standards have been harmonized. But each jurisdiction inevitably relies to a
degree on liquidity standards imposed elsewhere to ensure the soundness of potentially
systemically significant firms. Central banks and regulators need at least, therefore, to

13
come to a common understanding of what they are individually seeking to achieve with
liquidity regulation. Are we, for example, seeking with such regulation to limit the
likelihood of crisis, or the impact of a crisis should one arise, or both? What sort of
liquidity problems are envisaged in the regulation? Most importantly, we should seek a
common understanding of the dividing line between ex ante insurance, and ex post
resolution.
5. Conclusion
This is my last Financial Stability speech as Deputy Governor and I would like to leave
you with several thoughts.
First, I can’t help feeling that it is at times such as this, when we have a relatively benign
environment, that we should seek to address difficult and contentious issues of the kind I
have been discussing. It is certainly true that the risk transfer markets and the financial
system have coped, with remarkable success, and with few signs of instability, with the
various events and shocks in recent years. But we need to be sure that we are not
complacent in placing trust in the ability of the financial system to continue to absorb
shocks smoothly.
Second, policy makers have found it hard to discuss lender of last resort issues because
they can so quickly raise the spectre of moral hazard: by giving too many clues to their
likely response to instability, policy makers fear undermining market discipline and so
making crises more likely. Equally, public policy makers should recognise the distinction
between clarity about processes—where transparency to my mind can only be positive for
confidence—and transparency about how decisions might be reached in a particular case,
where constructive ambiguity remains important as a mechanism to reinforce market
discipline. On the other side of the fence, banks and financial institutions have made
impressive strides in coping with these realities, but may be reluctant to move explicitly
to transparent best practice standards. Maybe this is for fear of giving up competitive
advantage, or maybe it is a fear that regulators might seek to impose unwelcome
prescription in how they manage liquidity risks.
Third, my message today is that both public and private sectors would be wise to
overcome these inhibitions in the interest of developing mechanisms for providing
liquidity in a manner that is fit for purpose in today’s globalised world, and recognises the

14
new environment and systemic conjuncture. In the case of private entities, they, to my
mind, could show greater enthusiasm and leadership in coming up with sets of best
practice standards, in the knowledge that failure in one institution could be severely
damaging for others.
I say this in the knowledge that, in the case of the public authorities, debate on all these
issues is rising rapidly up the agenda, not just in London where the FSA and ourselves
have a shared responsibility, but in other major financial centres as well. Progress on
understanding all of these difficult issues can be made through ongoing informal dialogue
amongst the central banks and regulators that are most concerned with our largest
financial institutions. I am encouraged that there are a number of informal groups who are
undertaking work in this area. These feed into official groups such as the Financial
Stability Forum where the vital connection between the public and private sector can be
made.
These are stimulating and fascinating issues, and I confidently expect them to occupy
people’s minds for many years to come.
