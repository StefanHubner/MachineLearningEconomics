On Sunday it will be ten months since the UK’s vote to leave the EU in June 2016. In that context, I would
like to discuss two main points. The first is backward-looking, and relates to the economy's recent marked
outperformance compared to expectations just after the Brexit vote. The second is more forward-looking,
and relates to the economy’s adjustment in the next year or two to the Brexit process and how it is unlikely to
be simply a microcosm of Brexit’s long-run effects. In other words, the path to a post-Brexit Britain may not
be a straight line.
I’ll start with the first of those points: the economy’s recent – and welcome – resilience. In the August 2016
IR, just after the Brexit vote, the MPC forecast that the economy would slow markedly, with quarterly growth
close to zero in H2 2016 and early 2017. The BoE was not alone in expecting weaker growth: the IMF and
OECD made similar forecasts, and in general the consensus was slightly gloomier than the BoE (see
1

figure 1) . In practice, growth has remained solid. Indeed, on the current vintage of the ONS data, quarterly
GDP growth in H2 2016 was slightly stronger than H1.
Compared to the BoE’s forecasts from last August, the economy’s outperformance in H2 2016 was spread
widely across consumer spending, housing and business investment. Exports and imports both did better
than expected, but net trade overall was less supportive than forecast last August (see figure 2). In terms of
contributions to QoQ GDP growth in H2 2016, the upside in business and housing investment combined was
worth slightly more than the upside in consumer spending. Real wages turned out slightly softer than
expected, with slightly higher inflation and lower pay growth than forecast. Household savings have fallen
more than expected.

Even with weakness in retail sales volumes, most recent evidence suggests that the economy continued to
grow in Q1 of this year. For example, most business surveys are around longrun averages, job growth has
picked up, and NIESR estimate Q1 growth at 0.5% QoQ. The latest survey from the Federation of Small
Businesses is broadly consistent with this picture (see figure 3).
The BoE’s post-referendum forecast reflected three major factors.

First, the judgment that the possible longrun effects of Brexit would produce a modest adverse effect on
actual and potential growth nearterm. Analysis by the IMF and OECD suggests that Brexit will reduce UK
2

potential growth slightly over time, the next 15 years or so . Possible factors at work include reduced trade
openness, reduced inward investment, reduced competition in some sectors, lower net inward migration, and
the need to reallocate resources between different sectors. Of course, the long-run effects of EU exit are
highly uncertain, and perceptions may well change markedly as the details become clearer.

Using the Treasury survey of outside forecasters, the consensus for UK real GDP growth in mid-June (before the EU referendum) was
1.8% for 2016 and 2.1% for 2017. The consensus in August 2016 was for growth of 1.6% in 2016 and 0.7% in 2017. See also IMF
(2016b), OECD (2016b).

The BoE’s forecast assumed these longrun Brexit effects would come in linearly, hence having some effect
even in the first year or two, before Brexit actually occurs.

Second, and more importantly, the BoE interpreted the sharp dive in business surveys just after the
referendum as indicating that heightened uncertainty over the UK’s future trading arrangements would weigh
heavily on nearterm growth, notably consumer spending, business investment, housing and commercial
property. This appeared consistent with evidence that uncertainty often causes businesses and households
3

to defer major spending decisions .
No single measure can always reflect all aspects of uncertainty. The BoE’s approach is to combine various
indicators, including financial market data, surveys of households and businesses, and media citations of
4

5

uncertainty . There was a sharp spike in this and other uncertainty gauges just after the Brexit vote . This
was accompanied by a marked deterioration in business surveys, commercial and residential real estate
markets, and other signs (eg a preference for hiring temporary, rather than permanent, staff) that seemed to
6

reflect heightened business caution (see figure 4) . The BoE’s mid-August forecast put a lot of weight on
that sudden deterioration, although the forecast was actually less pessimistic than the surveys implied.

The third factor was the sharp drop in sterling, which is down by 16-17% since late-2015, with about two
thirds of that depreciation occurring after the referendum. The BoE judged that this depreciation would lift
inflation above target in 2017-19, eroding consumers’ real incomes and spending. But, reflecting
Brexit-related factors (including long run issues discussed above), the forecast assumed the lift to export
volumes from sterling’s depreciation would be less than usual.
7

Of course, forecasts are fallible . They will always be wrong in some respect. This does not mean that
forecasts are useless. It typically takes one to three years for the full effects of monetary policy actions on
growth and inflation to come through. Forecasts help the central bank to distinguish between transitory
developments in the economy – which usually do not warrant a monetary policy response – and more
important underlying trends. It is better to include forecasts in the policy process – accepting that the
8

forecasts are imperfect – rather than to only consider the economy's recent trends . Moreover, it is useful for
central banks to publish their forecasts to achieve public accountability for their actions, and to explain why
9

monetary policy has been set a certain way to meet the inflation target . Such forecasts also should make it
easier for observers with different views about the outlook to gauge how policy might evolve if they rather
than the central bank turn out to be right.

In that spirit, I would like to highlight several factors that probably help explain the economy’s recent
outperformance.

First, Brexit-related uncertainty probably mattered less than expected. The post-referendum spike in
the BoE’s uncertainty index proved short-lived and this measure now roughly matches its long-run norm.
This has been reflected in a commensurate rebound in business confidence and hiring attitudes, with a
10

relatively stable housing market. Moreover, the measurement of uncertainty is itself uncertain .

The mid-2016 jump in the BoE uncertainty index was driven heavily by components that are less well
correlated to economic growth (eg media mentions of “uncertainty”), see figure 5. The uncertainty indicators
that are best correlated to economic growth (eg net balance of households expecting higher unemployment)
generally did not deteriorate anything like so much, and maybe should be accorded higher weight in gauging
the overall level of uncertainty.

Second, UK monetary conditions loosened significantly in response to the Brexit vote. The MPC cut
Bank Rate and resumed asset purchases, the Term Funding Scheme helped ensure that the rate cut was
fully passed through, while the FPC’s reduction in the counter-cyclical capital buffer cut risks that the
referendum outcome led to tighter credit conditions.
All this, plus the lift to export profitability from sterling’s sharp depreciation, probably gave some boost to
demand and confidence in recent quarters. Of course, forecasts made at the time largely included these
factors, but their combined effect may have been greater than expected. The boost from these looser
financial conditions is not yet over.

Third, global activity has been stronger, with better trends in world trade, business surveys and consumer
surveys. This has given some lift to UK export prospects – but, perhaps more importantly, probably also
11

boosted asset prices and UK growth expectations . This is nothing to do with the Brexit vote, it just
happened to occur at around the same time.
Fourth, the uncertainty spike was not – unlike prior episodes -- accompanied by a major deterioration
in the cost and availability of credit, partly reflecting the factors noted above but perhaps also the greater
12

resilience of the banking system . The BoE Credit Conditions survey suggests there has been little overall
13

change in credit availability for households and businesses since the referendum : the FSB and Deloitte
CFO surveys confirm that picture for businesses (see figure 6). UK bank lending spreads have been roughly
stable and bank lending rates remain around record lows (see figure 7). Indeed, the average 2-year fixed
10

See Forbes (2016).
The CPB reports that the 3-month/3-month change in world trade volumes was 2.4% in January 2017 (9.9% annualised), the highest
pace since 2011, with especially strong import growth in emerging markets.

mortgage rate with 75% LTV has fallen by over 50bp since last May. It is hard to disentangle effects of
uncertainty from changes in credit conditions, because they often move closely together. But the UK’s 2016
experience supports the idea that uncertainty matters much less for growth if credit conditions do not
14

worsen .

And fifth, it is also possible that, unconnected to the Brexit vote, the UK expansion has developed
greater momentum and resilience, reflecting low unemployment, several years of solid real income growth,
and a reduced emphasis on balance sheet repair following the 2008-09 recession. Aggregate corporate
liquidity is relatively high, the ratio of household wealth to income is at a record high, and private sector
money growth has been reasonably firm since late-2012 (see figures 8 and 9). Once the post-Brexit
uncertainty spike faded, these positive underlying drivers have helped sustain demand in recent quarters.

These factors, some of which are mutually reinforcing, probably help to explain why demand has held up
better than expected. Many of these factors are likely to carry forward, supported also by the reduced pace
of UK fiscal tightening announced in the Autumn Statement and recent Budget. As a result, the BoE has
several times raised its near-term growth forecasts, and our central forecast for 2017 growth (published in
the February IR) is above the external consensus. As it became clear that the economy was doing better
than expected, the MPC moved from an easing bias last August to a neutral position in late 2016. Our latest
forecast, based on market rates, assumes a gently rising path of interest rates.

Having looked back, let me now try to look forward.
For the sake of argument, let’s assume for now that the work by the IMF and OECD is valid, and that Brexit
will lead to a slightly worse outlook for trade openness, investment, and productivity growth over time. Over
the long run, this is unlikely to affect either way the MPC's ability to keep inflation close to the 2% target,
although it would affect the rate of economic growth consistent with that inflation path.

The near-term adjustment to Brexit may well differ from those long run trends in several respects.
This is partly because the full effect of supply-side changes usually takes time to come through, especially
15

for productivity growth . It is also because the Brexit vote triggered a large depreciation of sterling, and this
depreciation will have powerful effects on the economy in the next year or two. It is also because the UK
economy is evolving in ways that have nothing to do with Brexit. Overall, I suspect that the next year or two
will see steady growth, above-target inflation, stronger exports, and a pickup in business investment. And
there are no signs so far that productivity trends are weakening.

CPI inflation has already risen from around zero in early 2016 to 2.3% in February/March this year, the
highest since late-2013. And the pace of price hikes has quickened notably in recent months. The

3-month/3-month seasonally adjusted annualized rate is running at about 4% for the headline CPI and
2½- 3% for core inflation. Both are the highest for over 4 years. These short-term measures are volatile, and
our target is for the 12-month change in the CPI. But these short-term growth rates help illustrate the extent
to which price hikes already are coming through, and beginning to squeeze consumers’ real incomes.

Part of this rise in YoY inflation rates reflects the pass-through to prices of tradable goods and services from
sterling’s depreciation, including that before the referendum. But there are other factors, including global
trends in oil and commodity prices. Indeed, YoY CPI inflation has risen by a similar amount in the OECD as a
16

whole, and only slightly less in the Euro Area (see figure 10) .

Given the usual lags, most of the post-referendum depreciation has not yet been reflected in consumer
prices. As this continues to feed through, the MPC's base case, described in the February IR, is for YoY CPI
inflation to rise to roughly 2¾% late this year and in early 2018. The full pass-through will probably take
several years.
In my view, there are risks that the near-term boost to inflation from sterling’s depreciation will be somewhat
steeper than the February IR base case, even with modest wage growth. In particular, a range of indicators
point to sizeable cost pressures in sectors focused on tradable items, a message backed up by the latest
17

FSB survey . These surveys mostly measure the breadth, rather than the pace, of price increases. But in
the past, they have been a useful guide to inflation trends for CPI items with a relatively high import content,
18

and point to considerable further upside in CPI prices in the next few quarters (see figure 11) .

With the average levels of sterling and commodity prices over the last few weeks, I would not be surprised if
CPI inflation reaches 3% later this year or early next. Such an outcome might well imply that the near-term
squeeze on household real incomes and spending, and on profits in sectors with high import content, will be
sharper than the IR base case. In theory, these readings could simply reflect faster pass through of sterling's
depreciation. In this case, higher near-term inflation would probably be followed by a faster subsequent drop
in inflation. But currently I suspect it is more likely to reflect a greater total pass-through, as after sterling's
depreciation in 2007-09. This would be consistent with evidence that currency swings driven by changes in
the economy's supply side (and Brexit probably falls into this category) tend to produce above-average pass
19

through to consumer prices . In this case, higher near-term inflation may well also signal some upside risks
to medium-term inflation, and hence to long-term inflation expectations.

Either way, I want to stress that this prospective near-term inflation pickup does not imply that Brexit Britain
will face persistently high inflation. Nor does it signal that the MPC has gone soft on our low inflation remit.
16

Since March 2016, EA CPI YoY inflation has risen from zero to +1.5% YoY, with no change in core inflation. Over the same period,
UK CPI inflation has risen from 0.5% YoY to 2.3% YoY, a rise of 1.8pp, with a 0.3pp rise in core inflation (from 1.5% YoY to 1.8%).

Over time, the appropriate monetary policy can and will ensure that inflation returns to the 2% target,
consistent with our remit.

Exports did not play much role in the economy’s resilience in the last few quarters . However, most recent
business surveys (including the FSB survey) show buoyant readings for export orders, confidence and
deliveries (see figure 12). These surveys suggest that in aggregate, UK exports are now likely to benefit
more or less as usual from sterling's depreciation rather than the more muted response implied by
consensus and BoE forecasts.

This produces something of a paradox: the referendum triggered a substantial sterling depreciation, probably
reflecting the view that Brexit will, over time, hinder UK exports in some way. But, for now, the UK remains a
full EU member with corresponding trade access. There is the possibility of an implementation phase that
might keep the UK’s trade arrangements fairly close to their current status for a period beyond the expiry of
the normal 2-year Article 50 deadline. The possibility of less-favourable trading arrangements post-Brexit
may still be too uncertain and distant to constrain exports in many sectors.
21

Hence, as my colleague Ben Broadbent noted, UK exporters are currently in something of a ‘sweet spot’ .
In the near-term, the boost from sterling’s depreciation may well outweigh any adverse Brexit effects and
generate quite strong export growth, especially given signs of better external growth. CBI surveys suggest
that a record share of manufacturing firms report improved competitiveness versus EU and non-EU markets
in recent quarters (see figure 13).

Indeed, even though the improvement in export orders has yet to be fully reflected in export volumes,
increases in export prices are already lifting the relative profitability of export-focused sectors. For example,
ONS data show a sharp rise in H2 2016 in the growth of nominal value added in sectors for which exports
play a major role (see figure 14), with a marked disparity between domestic-focused and export-focused
sectors.

Not all export-related sectors are benefiting equally. In particular, optimism over export prospects has risen
more sharply in sectors which usually have relatively short order books. On balance, in sectors with very
long order books (eg aerospace) -- and whose order books are perhaps more likely to extend into post-Brexit
conditions – optimism over export prospects has fallen slightly (see figure 15). Some sectors may be
constrained by limited spare capacity. Moreover, service sector exporters are generally less
currency-sensitive than manufacturing, and, correspondingly, report less recent improvement in external
competitiveness and export prospects. Nevertheless, there are signs of a sizeable boost from the low pound
in some service sectors, especially those focused on tourism in the UK.

20

The current account deficit did fall sharply in Q4, but this owed a lot to swings in flows of non-monetary gold, which often are erratic.
Excluding erratic items, the trade deficit was little changed between H1 and H2 2016.

If we have been too early in assuming that Brexit will reduce the economy’s openness, imports may also
prove to be stronger. Even so, I suspect that exports and net trade will add a bit more to growth this year,
and perhaps also 2018, than generally expected. Of course, this does not prove or disprove the notion
(which seems to be implicit in sterling’s depreciation) that Brexit might constrain UK exports longer term.
Regarding business investment – again, in contrast to worries of Brexit’s long-run effects – surveys
suggest that firms’ investment intentions have improved recently and are slightly above average overall,
especially in manufacturing (see figure 16). Reflecting the boost from sterling’s depreciation, the share of
manufacturing firms citing capacity expansion as a key reason to invest is the highest since 1979, with
particularly high readings among larger firms (more than 500 employees).

Investment may be supported also by the strength of corporate profits. The ratio of private non-oil corporate
profits to GDP in Q4 last year was the highest since 2000 (see figure 17). Taking annual data, the return on
capital for nonoil non-financial companies in 2016 was the highest since 1998. Overall corporate liquidity is
strong, and both the cost and availability of credit are favourable. Moreover,the BoE agents report that for
some firms, the need to increase efficiency in the face of increases in energy, labour and materials costs is
22

an additional spur to nearterm investment .

To be sure, Brexit uncertainties may limit the extent to which current favourable trading conditions lead to
strong investment growth and increased export capacity. But even so, for now, the indications from business
surveys seem to me to be less weak than implied by the consensus.
Productivity trends are more mixed. The BoE’s view has been that any adverse effects of Brexit on
productivity will be very gradual. In practice, with faster output growth but slower job growth, productivity
(output per hour) picked up to 1.2% YoY in Q4 2016, roughly half-way between the recent pace (2010-15
average of 0.5% YoY) and the pre-crisis average (1995-2007 average was 2.0% YoY).

It is possible that, with the economy probably near full employment and uncertainties over the future
availability of foreign workers, firms may now be more likely to increase investment in training and
labour-saving technology, or to undertake difficult decisions to re-engineer internal processes, in ways that
deliver more lasting productivity gains. Conversely, in recent years, the ample availability of
labour -- including foreign workers – may have encouraged some firms to adopt labour-intensive production
methods, and fuelled growth in labour-intensive sectors.

But it is also possible that the productivity pickup in H2 2016 was partly temporary, with Brexit uncertainties
leading firms to defer hiring despite solid activity growth. Hence, there may now be a catch-up in labour

demand. Indeed, the latest ONS figures show a sharp rise in hours worked in early 2017 (see figure 18).
The BoE agents report a slight pickup in firms’ hiring intentions (see figure 19), while the FSB survey points
23

to quite a marked rise in hiring plans . So it currently appears that the late-2016 productivity pickup is not
being sustained.

I stress that these recent and prospective near-term trends in prices, productivity, exports and investment
probably tell us very little either way over the long-run effects of Brexit over the next 10-20 years.

Let me try to tie this together.

My hunch is that in 2017-18 we will see higher near-term inflation, plus a greater rotation of growth away
from consumer spending and towards investment and net trade, than the February IR base case. The
upturns in exports and investment may keep the economy growing at around 2% YoY across 2017-18
combined even as consumer spending slows. To me, growth seems more likely to exceed the external
consensus (which is for around 1½% in 2017-18 combined) that to undershoot.

The continued modest pace of pay growth suggests that the output gap is not fully closed. Nevertheless,
with the jobless rate down to 4.7%, matching the lows of the last 40 years, slack is probably quite limited.
Moreover, recent months have seen quite a sharp drop in the numbers of under-employed part-time workers
and in the numbers of people who would like to work but are loosely attached to the workforce. As a result, a
U6-style under-employment rate - which adds these groups to the official jobless rate – has fallen from 9.7%
four months ago to 9.0% now, and is only slightly above the 2000-07 average (8.4%).
Unless the recent productivity pick up of H2 2016 is maintained – for which (as noted) evidence currently is
slim – economic growth of around 2% implies that unemployment and under-employment are unlikely to rise
in coming quarters and may well fall further.

Of course, there are many uncertainties. For example, consumers might retrench more than expected in
response to the currency-driven erosion of their real incomes. Exports might fail to live up to hopes evident
in business surveys. The process of Brexit might be bumpy, creating new waves of uncertainties. But there
are also upside risks to growth. For example, consumers might view the real wage squeeze as temporary
and, amidst ample credit availability, save less and maintain spending more than expected. Moreover, the
factors behind the economy's recent outperformance, including better global growth, may continue to propel
the economy more than expected going forward.

I would like to conclude with some comments on monetary policy.

The figure for Q1 2017 is the second highest for any quarter since the start of 2010.

The neutral interest rate is probably significantly lower than in the period before 2007 , but even so, I judge
that the current policy stance is clearly accommodative. The lower neutral rate implies that, if the MPC were
to lift rates at some stage, the tightening path probably would be limited and gradual. Moreover – and,
again, while not prejudging what I or the MPC might decide on monetary policy – a modest rise in rates
would still imply that considerable stimulus remains in place, helping to support output and jobs.
At the MPC’s most recent meeting, in March, I voted for unchanged policy, especially on the grounds that it
would be useful to see a bit more economic data for early 2017. I am not going to announce today how I will
vote at the May meeting. There is plenty of data still to receive, and insights to be gained. So that decision
will be made and announced at the proper time. I am not a big fan of using code words or language to signal
or pre-announce policy decisions before they have been made. But, I do believe it is important that any
monetary policy decisions, and the context underlying them – whether they are policy changes or not – are
clearly explained.

Finally, I do not believe the MPC is necessarily obliged to delay any policy moves until we have certainty
over the exact shape of Brexit and its long-run effects on the economy. We make our decisions from
meeting to meeting, and will fulfil our remit during the Brexit process and after it. Any policy decision carries
risks that subsequent events make the decision controversial, but that is always the case. Perceptions of the
economic outlook have already changed markedly in recent months and may well continue to do so. It is
natural for policy to respond to the changing outlook if needed, consistent with our low inflation remit.

Note: the left chart uses a 97-sector split of the economy, with sectors allocated according to whether the
share of exports in sectoral output is above or below average. The right chart uses a 21-sector split of
manufacturing industry in the CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey. Sectors are split depending in whether
the average length of order books over 2010-16 is below or above the average for all sectors. The sectors
with very long order books are those for which at least 15% of firms on average have an order book equal to
over 12 months of production: this covers aerospace, electrical engineering, motor vehicles and transport
equipment. Sources: CBI and BoE.
