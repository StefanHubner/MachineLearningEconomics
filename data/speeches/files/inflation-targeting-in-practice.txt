Introduction
Five and a half years ago in his Monnet lecture Charles Goodhart1 was able to talk
with some confidence of the features that particularly distinguished the UK’s
approach to inflation targeting. Today with over 20 countries, in every habitable
continent, formally operating some variant of inflation targeting and many more
adopting some parts of the framework, all actively sharing experience and best
practice, I suspect that most aspects of our approach would find a counterpart
somewhere else in the world. But Charles’s focus on the Monetary Policy
Committee’s (MPC) personal engagement in producing a published inflation forecast
still seems to me to capture the essence of the UK’s approach.
Today I want to talk about the role that forecasting has come to play in helping the
MPC to take and communicate its decisions. In what sense does the Committee really
‘own’ the published forecasts that go out under its name? How much use do we make
of models, and what models do we use? How far do our forecasts appear to drive
interest rate decisions? And is there any evidence that this has helped to make policy
more or less predictable? Finally I want to end by commenting on some of the issues
raised by forecasts as a means of communication.
Why the MPC has always been involved in forecasting
The MPC’s early involvement in the forecast process is firmly rooted in the kind of
committee it is, as well as the nature of the remit it has been given.
The objectives of UK monetary policy have been expressed in terms of an annual
inflation target since 1992, but responsibility for achieving the target initially lay with
the Treasury, acting on the Bank’s advice. In 1997, as part of a wide ranging
restructuring of the Bank of England’s role, decisions about interest rates were
delegated to the Bank’s new MPC. Its nine members – five internal Bank officials and
four external members chosen for their relevant knowledge and experience – are
individually, and publicly, accountable for meeting the inflation target.
The Government remains responsible for setting the annual inflation target, within the
context of legislation that requires the Bank of England to achieve ‘price stability and
subject to that to support the government’s objectives for output and employment’.
Under its current remit, the MPC is required to achieve 2% consumer price inflation
‘at all times’. If inflation deviates from target by more than 1 percentage point, the

Policy Committee and of the European system of central Banks’ Jean Monnet Lecture, Dublin

MPC has to write a public letter to the Chancellor to explain why, and what it is doing
to bring it back.
These arrangements remain relatively novel and unusual in UK constitutional terms.
Prior to 1997, a longstanding objection to Bank of England independence was
concern that such arrangements would be inconsistent with Ministerial duty to answer
to the House of Commons on major matters of policy. A high level of transparency
and openness about MPC decisions has been a critical aspect of meeting expectations
of parliamentary and public accountability as well as an effective way of enhancing
the credibility of monetary policy.
In fact greater openness about monetary policy was part of the package of changes
that were made to restore credibility after the UK’s exit from the ERM in 1992. The
Bank played its part by introducing a new quarterly Inflation Report, which by 1997
had won widespread respect for its objectivity and professionalism. Against this
background, the 1998 Bank of England Act required the new Monetary Policy
Committee to sign off the Bank’s Inflation Report. In practice, the MPC’s sign off has
been far from a formality, though the Inflation Report formally remains the Bank’s
report.
It is not that surprising that a committee of experts whose external members are based
in the Bank and who devote at least 60% of their time to monetary policy should get
deeply involved in preparing and debating the forecasts that they sign off. It may be
more remarkable that nine economists, labouring under the burden of individual
accountability, have so far succeeded in signing off 31 editions of the Inflation
Report, and found ways of dealing with the inevitable range of views.
The nature and role of the forecast
Nowadays the forecast has two related roles in the monetary policy process. First, it
helps the Committee to set monetary policy by organising, informing and focusing its
discussions. And second, it provides transparency about the Committee’s thinking
and plays a key part of its public communication strategy.2
Helping the MPC make decisions
Monetary policy needs to be forward looking, because interest rates act with a lag.
No monetary policymaker can avoid taking a view on the future. That view needs to
be coherent and disciplined, and informed by the best information available. But it

Charles gives five arguments for having an IR that is the responsibility of the MPC itself:
transparency, discipline, a better informed MPC, better forecasts and accountability (in that order). I
think they fit within my taxonomy.

4
also needs to reflect a realistic appreciation of the massive uncertainties inherent in
any forecast.
The MPC spends many hours discussing the projections that go into the Inflation
Report and the text that accompanies them. Although the process has been somewhat
streamlined since Charles’s day (when the committee spent a gruelling ten meetings a
quarter on the forecast on top of the usual monthly decision meetings) the forecast
round is probably still the largest single commitment of the Committee’s time.
Why? An important reason is that the forecast is not just an occasion for agreeing a
set of projections for the inflation outlook. It has come to provide an organising
framework for assessing all the relevant information, and an opportunity for a deeper
discussion of economic developments. Since I have been on the Committee, we have
spent at least half our allotted forecasting time debating longer term issues, such as
the effect of structural change in the labour market and the relationship between house
price inflation and consumption. Sometimes the outcome of those discussions has had
a material influence on our thinking about risks, even when the direct impact on the
central projections has been relatively minor.
What role do formal economic models play in the forecast? No set of economic
projections – least of all one owned by a committee of nine experts – can ever be the
outcome of a purely model-based operation. Judgement always plays a large role –
although different people frame their judgements in more or less model-based ways.
But it is difficult to make a forecast without using models: they provide an organising
framework for ensuring intellectual and accounting consistency in generating baseline
projections, and for considering alternative scenarios and risks.
What sorts of models does the Committee find useful?
In his peer review of the Bank’s use of economic models3, Adrian Pagan suggested
that economic modelling may involve a trade off between theoretical consistency
(good economics) and data coherence (a good fit); our goal should be to ensure that
we are positioned on the efficient frontier between the two.
Any model we use should in principle be on this frontier – but we want to be able to
move along the frontier and use different sorts of models for different purposes.
For example, if, as I have suggested, we want to use models to facilitate discussions
about fundamental economic issues, we clearly need models with rich economic
structures – structures that reflect the Committee’s views on the way the economy

works. The Bank’s new Quarterly Model (BEQM)4 has been developed with this
function very much in mind. But we also use other and smaller models with rich
economic structures to look at specific issues as part of our suite of models.
We also want to quantify the likely impacts on inflation and output of a range of
pieces of data news as accurately as possible. The numbers matter, so empirical
performance is important, too. We have worked hard at ensuring that BEQM does
well in this dimension, but we have also, within our suite, been developing more
statistically based models. We may use these models on their own – as stand alone
forecasting tools – or to inform the judgements that we make in using BEQM.
Let me say a few words about both the main model and the suite.
The motivation for the BEQM project was to help with the ‘intellectual framework’
role of the forecast. Without losing empirical performance, we wanted to improve
upon the previous main model’s articulation of the underlying structure of the
economy, to make it more explicitly consistent with the Committee’s beliefs.5 This
was made possible in the light of recent advances both in economic understanding –
particularly the emphasis on providing coherent micro foundations in macroeconomic
models – and in sheer computational power (both in terms of computing power and
the techniques applied).
BEQM is a large scale model by the standards of most academic research, but it is
small scale compared with traditional macro-econometric models. Compared with the
latter, it is also more of a general equilibrium model with an emphasis on internal
consistency. Households and firms optimise – they are forward-looking and they use
available information efficiently. Unlike our previous model, things add up: flows add
to stocks, profits are allocated, and so on. There is a high degree of simultaneity in
the way the model is solved. It no longer makes sense, nor is it at all easy, to consider
the model equation by equation.
This provides a greater degree of discipline on Committee members and staff, who are
now forced to confront the full implications of their judgements more explicitly. If
someone wants to change one of the economic relationships, they need to say why,
and acknowledge the possible implications for other behavioural relationships. If, for
example, we want to assume that the trend rate of labour productivity growth has
changed, the model requires us to recognise that there are implications for both
demand and supply. Faster productivity growth will increase productive capacity, but
income will also grow faster. So what might that mean for demand now?

6
This is a definite advance – providing the general equilibrium mechanisms in the new
model do in fact reflect our ideas about how the world works. But it also makes for a
more demanding discussion. There are no easy fixes, and it can be difficult to
accommodate views that differ from the model’s paradigm. As an example, the
model is firmly rooted in the rational expectations tradition. And we have assumed
that monetary policy is credible. Both are perfectly reasonable, arguably essential,
modelling assumptions. The fact that the new model makes them explicit can be
intellectually helpful. But it doesn’t make it any easier to provide answers to questions
about expectations and credibility. What if some agents base their decisions on
simple rules of thumb? BEQM has features that allow us to accommodate such
questions when we are forecasting – but in a more ad-hoc way that requires a
substantial degree of judgement.
We are still learning how to exploit all BEQM’s possibilities. But it clearly represents
a move towards the ‘Pagan frontier’, offering a higher degree of theoretical coherence
without losing empirical performance. A number of other central banks are working
on similar models – the ECB, Bank of Canada, FRB, Norges Bank and Bank of
Finland – as well as the IMF. The international modelling community is an
exemplary forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences, and we have learnt – and
will continue to learn – a lot from the experience of others.
No model can do everything. All models oversimplify drastically. The trick is to
identify an appropriate degree of simplification for the task in hand. So the Committee
has never been prepared to rely on one model. This has led to attempts to develop a
suite of models.
The suite takes two forms.
One is a range of models that are complementary to the core forecasting model.
These hold up a magnifying glass to particular parts of the economy, and allow us to
take account of the influence of a wider range of factors in more detail than could be
accommodated in the main model. These (sub-) models might be geared towards
analysing particular policy issues (e.g., supply chain pricing models, the future
development of household and corporate gearing, productivity growth in the
distribution sector). Or they might also provide the interface between our very shortterm conjunctural analysis, and the 2-3 year forecast.
Second, we have a set of statistical models. The MPC attempts to process a huge
amount of information before each monthly decision. The Committee already uses
some data-driven forecasts (for example, forecasts that uses many variables to
forecast in an a-theoretic way, statistical models to produce near term forecasts for
key data such as CPI, and small models that filter ONS first releases, to handle the

7
inevitable data uncertainty associated with early releases6). But it is a herculean task
to absorb and analyse all the data. So, responding to the needs of the MPC, but also to
suggestions by Pagan, the staff is in the process of developing and evaluating more
models geared towards empirical forecasting accuracy and finding ways of combining
these forecasts in a statistically efficient way. This is very much work in progress,
with the aim of helping the MPC to form judgements both about the most likely
outturns and the uncertainty surrounding them.
Handling uncertainty and disagreement
Even armed with a range of economic models to aid structured discussion and enforce
a degree of intellectual discipline, how is it possible for a group of nine individually
accountable economists to reach sufficient agreement to publish a forecast which is
described as reflecting their best collective judgement?
An important part of the answer lies in the use of formal techniques to capture
uncertainty and risk. These antedate the MPC. The Bank of England started
publishing fan charts for its inflation projections in February 1996, following an early
experiment with what might be called ‘trumpet charts’.7 The motivation was purely to
illustrate the uncertainty inherent in all economic projections. While trumpets
consisted of a single shaded area around a central projection, corresponding to
average absolute forecast errors (see Chart 1), fan charts (see Chart 2) were graduated
to show the full distribution of possible outcomes.8

Nowadays, each Inflation Report includes fan charts for inflation and output which
reflect the Committee’s views on the full distribution of possible outcomes. While the
width of the fan bears some relation to the size of forecast errors over the past decade
(the distribution of past forecast errors provide a benchmark calibration), its main
features – the moments of the underlying distribution – change with each forecast to
reflect the Committee’s best judgement about the balance of risks around the outlook
for inflation and output and the degree of uncertainty. While many other central banks
now publish fan charts, the MPC is still relatively unusual in basing them on the
policymakers’ subjective view about the distribution of risks, rather than staff views
or historical/statistical measures of past errors.
The MPC’s approach to constructing fan charts can help the members come to an
agreement on the substantive issues, while retaining their individual views. This is
because the risks are often where the major differences of opinion amongst members
lie. And while the members may be able to agree on a collective view of the overall
outlook including the degree of uncertainty and balance of risks, it might be for
slightly different reasons. To be sure, there have been times when differences of view
about the central projection have been too significant to be handled within the ambit
of the fan chart and on those (few) occasions the Inflation Report has included
material illustrating the minority view. But, as the MPC’s preface to the Inflation
Report notes, the fan charts reflect the Committee’s best collective judgement about
the most likely paths for output and inflation and the uncertainties surrounding the
central projections, while recognising that members may have slightly different views
about the underlying assumptions.

9
Forecasts and interest rate decisions
How influential is the forecasting process when it comes to the actual business of
taking decisions about interest rates?
One yardstick might be whether the MPC is more likely to change rates in Inflation
Report months. There is no necessary reason why this should be so: information
accrues relatively evenly over the year, and the Committee goes through the same
decision taking process every month. On the other hand, the MPC might be more
likely to change rates after a systematic and full review of the inflation outlook, rather
than in response to the news on the month. On this argument, ready-reckoners may
give a rough indication of what the impact of new data may be, but they are no
substitute for a full analysis. So in non-Inflation Report months the MPC may
sometimes decide to ‘wait-and-see’ – to postpone a possible interest rate change until
more evidence has accumulated.
As it happens, market economists have tended to think that interest rate changes were
more likely in Inflation Report months. Since 1998, Reuters have asked a group of
economists (initially around 20-30, now 40 or more) to attach probabilities to a range
of different outcomes for interest rates, so we can calculate a mean and a mode
expected interest rate change across individuals. Panel B in Chart 3 split the months
in which the mode is for a (25bp) change into Inflation Report and non-Inflation
Report months. According to this measure, markets have consistently thought that
changes were more likely in Inflation Report months.
The data on interest rate changes provide mixed evidence. Over the period since 1997
as a whole, the Committee has displayed a preference for changing rates in Inflation
Report months. But it showed no such tendency in its early years. The picture since
2001 is very different, with almost two thirds of rates changes taking place in
Inflation Report months, compared with the one third that would be expected if rate
changes were evenly spread over the year. And no fewer than six of the last eight rate
changes have coincided with the publication of an Inflation Report. (See Chart 3 and
Table 2 for details).

What – if anything – should be read into the MPCs apparent change in behaviour? On
the face of it, the evidence might suggest that the re-evaluation of the outlook
undertaken during the quarterly forecast has become more influential. But there are a
number of possible explanations.
Most obviously, it could be a reflection of the shocks that have come along in the last
4 years. These may have required fewer changes in the policy rate than in the pre2001 period. Alternatively, the required adjustments in rates might have been bigger
in the early days, and if the MPC had an inclination to change rates in small steps,
perhaps because it had good reasons for proceeding cautiously, then larger desired
adjustments might have required more frequent changes: of the 16 changes in the first
period, 7 were back-to-back, while in the second period, only 4 out of the 14 changes
happened in consecutive meetings.
The turnover in the Committee’s membership since 2000 might provide a different
kind of explanation. The present Committee contains only one member (the present
Governor) who has been there from the outset, and some of the early members served
short terms. Might the latter day tendency towards changing rates only after a forecast
reflect a generally less activist approach to setting rates?
Table 1 provides an unscientific guide to Committee members’ degree of activism: it
is arranged with the most ‘activist members’ (identified as those voting

11
proportionately most frequently for a rate change) at the top.9 If personal preferences
played no role, we might expect to see a relationship between activism and ‘MPC
vintage’ – if MPC members responded to the same shocks, or their behaviour was
affected by some other common factor, there would be clusters. Keen MPC watchers
will no doubt find some support for the view that personality matters. But, in general,
the members who voted for the most rate changes are associated with the earlier years
of the Committee, consistent with the idea that the MPC may have needed to respond
more frequently during that period.10

Up to and including the February 2005 MPC meeting.

Has the publication of regular forecasts, which are seen to bear a close relationship to
the decision taking process, helped to make the policy decisions themselves more
9

We have excluded the first 7 months of the MPC’s existence to allow for the possibility that the first
rate changes were reflecting necessary adjustments to reach what the MPC thought was the right level
of interest rates.
10
There are, of course, also other possible explanations, e.g. if a member has views which are
consistently adrift of the rest of the Committee, leading them to believe that rates are significantly too
low/high, then they may repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – vote for a change without being ‘activist’ in
the sense of wanting to change rates frequently in response to news.

12
predictable? The test is whether markets are less likely to be surprised by interest rate
changes, given full knowledge of all the relevant economic news.
We ran some simple statistical tests on two measures of ‘market surprises’. One is
based on the Reuters poll of economists. The surprise measure is the difference
between the actual repo rate change and the mean expected repo rate change. The
other surprise measure is a bit further out along the yield curve: changes in the
implied three-month forward LIBOR rate.11
Both measures suggest that interest rate surprises have become significantly smaller
in the post-2001 period than previously (Table 2 Panel C), consistent with improved
policy predictability. But, intriguingly, there is also some tentative evidence that
surprises in Inflation Report months tend to be relatively large.12 What are we to
make of that?
On closer inspection, this finding seems to relate to the decision in Inflation Report
months – not the publication of the Report itself a week later, or the minutes the week
after that (Panel E shows that the market reaction to the policy decision is, on average,
significantly bigger than the reaction to the Report and the minutes). This might
imply that it is the rethink during the preparation of the Inflation Report that counts.
But, once announced, the decision itself (and the accompanying press notice, if rates
have changed) provides most of the information the market needs to understand the
Committee’s approach. This would be consistent with a fairly high degree of policy
predictability.
It is worth emphasising that the observed tendency for interest rate changes to
coincide with the publication of an Inflation Report does not imply that interest rate
changes are tied in any mechanical way to the central projection for inflation. The
assessment of risks is always a material factor in determining policy, as well as an
important aspect of the presentation of the forecast. For example in our latest Inflation
Report we published a central projection which showed inflation rising gently but
steadily above the 2% target, assuming a nearly flat profile of interest rates out to
three years. But the Report noted that the balance of risks was to the downside and
singled out some key near term risk areas, such as the household sector. This
11

More precisely, this is an implied 3-month Libor forward rate at a constant horizon of 3-months,
where the constant horizon is calculated by linear interpolation of adjacent futures contracts. The
results are largely invariant to using six or twelve month horizons.
12
This could, of course, be entirely driven by the expectation that there would be no move in nonInflation Report months: in the extreme, if the distribution of surprises in those months is degenerate
(i.e. so that no one expected a change in rate and this was what actually happened) then the statement
that surprises are bigger in Inflation Report months is no different from the statement that rates are only
expected to change in these months. The closer the distribution comes to being degenerate, the more
weight should be attached to that interpretation. But both the average surprise and its variance are
significant.

13
provided a nuanced background to the MPC’s February decision to hold rates
unchanged.
Forecasts and public communication
All inflation targeting central banks use their forecasts as a communication tool. They
provide a coherent statement of policymakers’ thinking about the economic outlook
and the policy stance. Together with the minutes of the policy meetings (in our case
published with individual votes after two weeks), this helps to discharge the
Committee’s democratic duty to explain itself, as well as supporting its credibility and
helping to anchor inflation expectations.13 The Inflation Report plays a central role in
the Committee’s communication. Since August 2003 the Governor has fronted the
regular Inflation Report press conference, and the MPC’s appearances in front of the
Treasury Select Committee has been (loosely) linked to the Inflation Report cycle.
This brings me to a much debated question: how much information should a central
bank provide? Academics have tended to press the case for more transparency, while
practicing central bankers have been more cautious, (though much more predisposed
to openness than they would have been twenty years ago). Don Kohn14 argues that
“more is not necessarily always better, and at each step of the way central banks have
needed to take account of the potential costs as well as the benefits of greater
transparency”. In particular it is argued that the publication of some kinds of
information could make it more difficult for policymakers to do their job, with
discussions of the possible path of future interest rates being seen as particularly
hazardous, if they appear “as a firmer pre commitment than they were intended to
be”.15
Arguably these should not be a first order issues for central banks with a transparent
inflation targeting framework. The objectives of policy are clear, and outside
commentators should have access to enough information to work out the future
direction of rates for themselves. Nevertheless there has been a closely related debate
13

As Mishkin puts it ‘.[H]aving secretive central banks is inherently undemocratic…[B]asic
democratic principles require that the central bank be accountable for its actions: this requires that the
public understands what the central bank is doing. In addition, democratic principles indicate that the
preferences of policymakers need to be aligned with those of the society at large.’ Mishkin, F (2004)

targeting Reserve Bank of Australia.
14
Kohn, D (2005) ‘Central Bank Communication’. Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the American
Economic Association January 2005.
15
Mishkin has sympathy for this view, noting that “[w]hen new information comes in and the central
bank changes the policy rate from its projected path, the public may see this as reneging on its
announced policy or an indication that the central bank's previous policy settings were a mistake.
Thus, even when the central bank is conducting its policy in an optimal manner, deviations from its
projected path may be viewed as a central bank failure and could hurt the central bank's credibility.”

14
about how transparent an inflation targeting central bank should be about the interest
rates on which its forecasts are based. An obvious reason for wanting more direct
information about the ‘preferred’ path is to get direct evidence on the interest rate
strategy. (How quickly will rates rise? What are the advantages of a ‘wait-and-see’
approach?)
The MPC has long published forecasts on two different interest rate assumptions. On
one – the constant rate assumption – interest rates are held constant over the entire
forecast horizon. On the other, interest rates evolve in line with rates expected by
financial markets. Until August 2004, the presentation emphasised the forecast based
on constant rates. Since last August we have reversed the presentation, to emphasise
the market rate assumption.16
The constant interest rate path is obviously a stylised assumption, which conveys
limited information about future policy intentions. The message is that the MPC
makes interest rate decisions one at a time, and that it has not made up its mind about
what future path of rates will be consistent with the inflation target. The market
interest rate path too is a conditioning assumption, not the MPC’s prediction about
future rates. The difference is that, to the extent that the market rate curve embodies
the market’s guess about where the MPC will take rates, forecasts predicated on the
market rate are more easily interpreted as a comment on that view.
So how much significance should be read into our change of conditioning
assumption? Did the switch to market rates represent a tentative step towards
providing more guidance on the future direction of policy?
The fact that interest rates were historically very low in 2003 and early 2004 has some
bearing on the matter. Many academics, notably Lars Svensson, have argued
persuasively that the use of an unrealistic conditioning assumption makes it more
difficult for the public to interpret the MPC’s reading of the economic outlook. As
Charlie Bean has pointed out,17 this is certainly true if interest rates are some way off
‘normal’ levels or if for other reasons, they are expected to increase or decrease
substantially over the forecast horizon – and the longer the time horizon of the
forecast, the more force this argument has.
Our decision to shift the focus of the presentation to market rates was coupled with a
decision to publish forecasts for three years, rather than two, as was previously the
case. This did not reflect a change in policy horizon – we are required to meet our 2%
target ‘at all times’. But it did provide useful context for interpreting the gradient of

inflation forecasts at the two year horizon, and hence a clearer indication of future
policy, if the economy evolves in line with the central projection.
The shift to using a market rate assumption was a very modest step towards greater
transparency. At a technical level, it is a non trivial task to translate any market rate
yield curve into a conventional forecasting assumption which is a genuine reflection
of market expectations of future official interest rates.18 And markets are themselves
uncertain about the path of future rates so we publish a fan chart for market interest
rate to help quantify that uncertainty, based on options prices.

rates – Inflation Report February 2005

There is a big difference between a conditioning assumption and a commitment, not
least because there is a big gap between anyone’s current guess at where rates might
need to go to meet the inflation target, conditional on the data available at any point in
time, and where the MPC will actually take rates given the information it may have in
the future. But the MPC was conscious of the risk of misinterpretation, so the
transition was made gradually – with the Governor reflecting on the market curve in
his remarks at the February and May Inflation Report press conferences, and the MPC
referring to the market curve in the minutes during the spring. By the time the switch
was introduced in the August Inflation Report, MPC and markets understood the
nature of the conditioning assumption, and the change itself was seen as the marginal
improvement that it is.
Different inflation targeting central banks have evolved their own ways of
communicating. At one extreme, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand

publishes his own forecast of future interest rates – though he is the sole decision
taker in that regime. And at the Norges Bank, staff produce material that explicitly
sets out possible strategies for interest rate decisions in the form of a range of interest
rates for the next 3-4 months, and invite the interest rate setting committee to endorse
them, and provide a commentary on market expectations of future interest rates. As
Charles Goodhart has argued, it is difficult, as a practical matter, to imagine a
committee of nine individually accountable experts doing that.
Institutional and political arrangements matter. What works in one environment may
not work elsewhere. And central banks need to employ consistent modes of
communication and language if they are to be well understood. Abrupt changes in
what is communicated, and how, always carry risks of confusion. But even the best
designed system needs to evolve. Greater transparency involves learning both by
policymakers and by those who seek to interpret their actions. The degree of monetary
policy transparency in the UK now would have been regarded as quite unthinkable
fifteen years ago. I see no reason to suppose that we have reached the end of the road
yet.
Conclusions
Published forecasts have come to play a key role in formulating and communicating
interest rate decisions within the UK approach to inflation targeting. The strength of
this approach is that – flawed and inadequate as all projections inevitably are – a good
forecast paints a picture that is worth a thousand words. And that counts, both when it
comes to organising the debate between nine experts, and when it comes to explaining
the basis of policy to a non expert public.
But forecasts are highly fallible, so our forecast centred approach to inflation targeting
has gone hand in hand with a determined effort to illustrate the wide range of
uncertainties around any central projection and a systematic attempt to factor the
Committee’s own judgements about the risks into decision taking. That, for me, is a
key reason for resisting recent calls by the IMF and others for the Bank to ‘publish
numerical projections for a broader range of key variables’. Detail is seductive – but it
can also be highly misleading, and a committee that spent its time debating the details
of the forecast rather than using it as a tool to address big picture issues would be at
risk of losing its way.
Forecasts are indispensable – but they should be handled with care.

Notes:
Tests are for significance based on t-test for difference between two sample means, except for Panel (A) and (B), which is a test for whether
rate changes are distributed 1/3 in IR months and 2/3 in other months. The critical values for Panel (A) and (B) are derived from on Monte Carlo simulations.
Excludes the special MPC meeting following 11 September 2001.
