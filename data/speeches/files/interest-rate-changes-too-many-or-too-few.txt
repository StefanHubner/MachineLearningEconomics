Introduction
It is a great pleasure to be here with you tonight. It is now almost ten years since the
Bank of England was given independence to set interest rates, and the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) sprang into being. These ten years have seen many changes
in the economy both UK-wide and in the Tees Valley. Here unemployment has fallen
from 7.1% to 3.8%, with a rising proportion of people active in the labour market, and
rising employment rates. With the chemicals and steel industries enjoying a period of
strength, there are encouraging signs of improvement in the trend of value-added per
head relative to the rest of the UK. And regeneration has recently been boosted by the
announcement that Middlesbrough is to be the site of a second-tier regional casino,
further evidence of greater economic diversity. It’s a positive story.

The first ten years of the MPC has supported these positive trends – for the UK as a
whole growth has averaged 2.8%, and inflation, surprisingly, has remained within a
one percent range either side of the 2% target. Both inflation and growth have been
more stable than the experience of the previous three decades. Ten years is long
enough to enable some analysis of issues around the MPC’s behaviour, and of
whether that behaviour has changed over time. Also, almost six years since I joined
the MPC, it’s an opportunity to reflect on my own experience of being a policymaker.

I focus here on the question which in an obvious sense is the one which pre-occupies
each of us at every meeting - does the news and analysis of the past month add up to a
case for changing interest rates? Since the first meeting in June 1997, the MPC has
met 119 times, and rates have been changed at 34 of these meetings. The peak of
interest rates during the MPC period was 7.5%, reached in June 1998. The low point
for interest rates was 3.5%, reached in July 2003, the last in the series of cuts which
broadly followed the significant falls in equity markets between 2000 and 2003.
Curiously, Bank Rate today, at 5.25%, is now back to that prevailing when I joined
the MPC in 2001.

The discussion describes briefly some of the theoretical arguments which have been
advanced about the timing of interest rate changes, and about how policy should
respond to news. Then I look at how the MPC’s actions compare with theoretical
models of how monetary policymakers behave, and whether we appear to follow a
gradualist approach. In this context, it is also of interest to consider how individual
MPC members behave, and finally whether the MPC’s behaviour differs from that of
other central banks.

I also consider the present economic conjuncture, to what extent this is presenting the
MPC with new challenges, and how these questions about the timing of interest rate
changes, and policy strategy might apply to today’s circumstances.

The timing of interest changes – theoretical considerations

Much external commentary on individual voting behaviour on the MPC seeks to
classify us as ‘doves’ or ‘hawks’. But I would certainly reject this. If we were predisposed to be either ‘soft’ or ‘hard’ with regard to keeping inflation low, the
implication would be that we would be failing to do our job - of managing inflation in
order to achieve a symmetric target. Interest rate decisions are approached within a
shared basic framework which is forward-looking - aiming to prevent movements
away from the target anticipated around 18-24 months after the interest rate decision.
Policy is pre-emptive - looking to move early in the event of a threat to the target,
implying that decisions will only reflect recent CPI outturns to the extent that these
are judged to contain information about inflation further ahead. Of course, there will
be disagreements at a particular time about whether a change in base rates is
necessary, either reflecting different judgements about the central forecast for CPI
inflation, or about the risks around it.

Disagreements are not always about the economic outlook and the risks, however.
They can also arise because of a different view about the appropriate monetary
strategy, although the two cannot always be clearly separated.

Two aspects of

strategy relate to timing: gradualism (which could broadly be described as whether a
required move in interest rates should be implemented in stages, rather than all at
once) and waiting (which here I will generally use to refer to caution about making a
3

change in direction in the path of interest rates.) However, the term waiting might
also be used in another sense, to talk about waiting for particular piece of information,
or indeed waiting for the more sophisticated analysis of news which the MPC
undertakes during a forecast round.

Gradualism
One strand of discussion about monetary policy strategy discusses how uncertainty
should affect policymakers’ behaviour. In particular, this looks at whether there is a
case for making the entire interest rate change judged necessary in response to a given
shock immediately, or in several steps.1 A number of arguments have been put
forward in favour of a more gradual approach. The key one refers to uncertainty
about how much inflation will respond to a given change in interest rates, due to the
fact that the parameters of our model of the economy cannot be known with precision.
This is frequently referred to as Brainard uncertainty, after his seminal article2. A
second reason for gradualism results from uncertainty about the most recent economic
data - the element of noise, relative to news, in early data estimates increases the risk
of overreaction to changes in economic conditions.

However, there are other arguments suggesting that gradualism is not always the right
approach. Policymakers looking at the conjuncture may be unclear about some
aspects of the underlying model of the economy (model uncertainty) – perhaps
because it is a period of rapid structural change, or because of the size and nature of
the shock which has occurred. In these circumstances, it can be shown that a gradual
approach is not always justified3. Or, the view taken of the balance of risks may be
judged to indicate that acting slowly increases the probability of a bad outcome in
which inflation moves substantially away from target.

In practice, I have found that the considerations being weighed when taking the
monthly interest rate decision are such that I am often balancing concern about
overreacting to news (leading to unnecessary economic volatility), against the fear of
not responding robustly enough to changing conditions (and so acting too little, too

late, necessitating a larger correction at a future date). There are few months which
point clearly to a gradualist, or to a more robust, approach.

Waiting
One definition of waiting is caution about making a change in interest rates which
reverses the direction of the previous change. An early move back towards tightening
after a period of loosening, or vice versa, tends to create the impression that the
previous set of changes had moved too far, and therefore could be damaging to
credibility. Equally, this suggests that clear evidence in support of any change of
direction is needed, as the risks attached to a second reversal (concerns about
provoking sharp money market movements and public appearance of policy
confusion) may increase the cost of a mistake.
In addition, it has been argued4 that too frequent reversals would reduce the ability of
Bank Rate changes to affect longer-term interest rates. This ability arises because
when the central bank is believed to be pursuing a gradualist policy, then a change of
short-term interest rates in a new, upward, direction can gain added traction by
altering expectations of interest rates further along the yield curve, tightening
monetary conditions further. However, there is a possible contradiction here. If the
purpose of changing Bank Rate gradually is to avoid unnecessary volatility, then if the
market sees through this tactic to some extent then the risk of undue tightening or
loosening remains.

(Of course, if a subsequent move in Bank Rate proves

unnecessary, then the market will undo some of its shift, and this might be preferable
for credibility reasons to a larger change in policy rates which is then partly
unwound).

In approaching the month-by-month decision on interest rates over the past six years
my general approach, in the context of the above discussion, has been consciously to
seek to move early in response to indications that future inflation was likely to deviate
from the target. This has the clear advantage of enabling future small moves in the
same direction if new data suggests this is necessary, and lessens the risk of the need
for a sharper change in Bank Rate at a later date. I have therefore tried to put more

4

Woodford (1999)

weight on reducing the risk of a big policy mistake, than on worries over short-term
questioning of credibility if policy reversal proves to be needed5. But this does not
mean I have always sought to respond mechanically to deviations from target at
around the two-year forecast horizon. The other key factors I have taken into account
include the path of the inflation projection over the whole forecast period, and when
appropriate, the risk of creating unnecessary volatility in the path of output growth.
An example of this was the MPC meeting on 7 and 8 November 2001 when most
members favoured a reduction in interest rates of 50 basis points, on the basis that "a
cut [would] underpin confidence domestically, by underlining the Committee's
continued readiness to act to support demand in line with achieving the inflation target
over the medium term". One of the arguments against the cut was that "too large a cut
might fuel consumer borrowing growth excessively, weakening household balance
sheets and adding to risks for the future…", thus increasing output volatility.

Interest rate rules

The above discussion suggests that central bank behaviour might be expected to
demonstrate two features – some tendency towards gradualism (making a series of
small changes in the same direction in response to a piece of news) and a tendency
towards inertia (waiting for longer than might be expected before making a change in
interest rates in the opposite direction to that of previous movements). Does the
evidence in the UK with regard to the period in which the MPC has operated, indicate
that behaviour conforms to these expectations?

Evidence from Taylor rules
Gradualism can be assessed by comparing central bank behaviour with the actions
which would have resulted from the use of a simple Taylor rule, in which the interest
rate responds to movements in inflation and in a measure of the output gap. When
this approach is used to model actual central bank behaviour, it is often found
necessary to add in the lagged interest rate. The coefficient on this variable is usually
close to one, and this is interpreted as evidence of gradualism. However, there are a
number of reasons to be cautious about this conclusion. Other factors need to be

5

Since 1997 policy reversals have only occurred six times

6

taken into account – such as the fact that the policymaker uses realtime data, not final,
or that there may be variables not included in the model (‘unobserved’ variables), but
which policymakers are also responding to. If these variables are persistent, then the
policymakers’ response may appear gradual when modelled by a simple Taylor rule.

Estimation of Taylor rules for the UK, looking at two time periods (1976-1996 and a
shorter period 1997-2006, since the establishment of MPC independence), gives
results which suggest that policy was gradual in both periods. In the MPC period, it
took around seven quarters to make half of the optimal policy change and slightly
longer for the earlier period. This result is not much changed by using different
definitions of the output gap, nor by using real-time data. However, these results are
not entirely satisfactory, as there are signs of model misspecification.

And, as argued above, in practice movements in variables other than the inflation rate
and output gap will influence interest rate decisions. Following previous work for the
US6, which allows the interest rate to respond to some (in the Taylor rule) unobserved
variables, preliminary results for the UK suggest much less smoothing than in the
simple Taylor rule (less than two quarters to make half of the optimal policy change in
the MPC period), and less model misspecification. These results also suggest that the
policy rate seemed to move more quickly to its optimum level in the MPC period,
compared to the previous twenty years.

About half of the variation in this

‘unobserved’ component can be explained by a measure of movements in the equity
risk premium (see Chart 1), suggesting that financial market conditions may be at
least part of the variables omitted in simple Taylor rules. Further, if revisions to the
output gap are also included, then well over half of the variation can be explained.
This extension of the simple Taylor rule therefore suggests that there is less evidence
of inertia in central bank decisions, which could be interpreted as sub-optimal, than
initial work had implied.

The inflation forecast and MPC reaction function

6

Gerlach-Kristen (2004)

A different way to assess this question was also put forward recently by Charles
Goodhart7. This looked at how much the MPC decisions responded to an ex-ante
forecast, the forecast which he estimates the MPC would have published for inflation
at the two year horizon if interest rates were left unchanged. (The ex-post inflation
forecast in this case is the one published in the quarterly Inflation Report. If interest
rates are unchanged, the ex-ante and ex-post forecast are identical.) Perhaps not
surprisingly, given that the 2-year forecast is generally quite close to the target, he
finds that the results here suggest that the MPC has acted aggressively to eliminate
predicted deviations from the target. Using the same approach, but over a slightly
longer period (1997-2006), a model based on a full policy response to ex-ante
forecasts for growth and inflation fits the actual interest rate movement quite well (see
Chart 2), with little evidence of interest rate smoothing at the quarterly frequency.

This is a little different from the results for interest rate gradualism estimated using
the simple Taylor rule – but again this may not be surprising, as that rule uses current
data, whereas policymakers are forward-looking. Taken at face value, this analysis
might suggest that the history of MPC decisions implies a swift policy response to
news.

However, there is an alternative interpretation of these results, which is that the
forecast itself behaves in a gradualist manner. The two year ex-ante forecasts tend to
deviate from target in the same direction for a number of quarters – on average three
quarters for the MPC period. From my experience on the MPC, I would suggest a
number of possible reasons. One is that the MPC learns over time about the size of
the shock. A second is that there is structural change in a model parameter which the
MPC realises only gradually. Thirdly, some pieces of news can be treated in a
gradualist way, for example sharp changes in asset prices, so that they do not have
their full effect on the forecast unless they prove to be more than just noise in the
markets, to prevent the quarterly inflation forecast (and nominal interest rates) being
unduly volatile.

MPC and activism and waiting

7

Goodhart (2005)

Individuals versus whole committee
I suggested that MPC members could be divided into groups according to their degree
of activism (how often they voted to change interest rates) rather than the more
familiar hawks or doves. One way to assess activism is to consider the probability
that a member voted for a change in interest rates, having voted with the majority in
the last meeting (in order to exclude serial minority votes for a change). Table 1
shows the results of the comparison of probabilities for individuals and for the whole
MPC, calculated over the period June 1997 to February 2007. On average, with serial
minority voting excluded, the mean probability for individuals is not statistically
different from that for the whole MPC.

There is considerable variation among

members, with John Vickers, on this basis, having been noticeably the most active –
but no sign of any particular skew, with the median probability close to the mean
(Chart 3 and Table 1). If serial voting is included, Steve Nickell, Willem Buiter and
Sushil Wadhwani appear to be more active than if it is excluded, as they had long
periods of voting for change against the majority.

Over the past ten years there have been four periods in which interest rates were kept
unchanged for at least eleven months. In the first of these (March 2000 to January
2001) the proportion of dissenting votes was above the average. However, in the
other three this was not the case, suggesting that economic stability, rather than
committee inertia, was the reason.

Over the whole period, the MPC has been more activist, measured purely in terms of
the frequency of interest changes, than were the Chancellors in the period between the
ERM crisis and the establishment of the MPC. However, this activity rate has tended
to diminish over time. So it would be plausible to attribute this either to a more stable
economy, or to greater credibility of the central bank, meaning that smaller and fewer
interest rate changes would be required to achieve the inflation target.

Some

preliminary work looking for economic factors which are related to activity has not
produced any clear results, although they suggest that higher past inflation volatility,
or greater uncertainty about the one-year ahead forecast, are both linked with an
increase in policy activism. An alternative explanation is that experience has led to a
greater appreciation of the value of waiting (in a study of committee and individual
9

behaviour, Lombardelli et al suggested that the superior results from committee
voting were because the committee learnt to be less activist.)8

However, one notable difference among groups of members is that the external
members, those appointed to bring outside expertise and who are not permanent bank
employees, are more activist than the internals. The probability of voting for a
change, having been in the majority in the previous meeting, is around one-in-three
for an external member, and somewhat lower for an internal. This difference remains
even when allowance is made for the fact that external members typically serve
shorter terms, and activity rates tend to decline with time. It is more difficult to
account for this aspect of behaviour – and it is fair to point out that it is not true of all
individuals.

Both the Governors have measured activity rates a little above the

average, whereas some of the externals (myself included, despite my activist
inclinations) have been less active than the average.

Waiting
The most notable characteristic of MPC voting behaviour, at least over the recent past,
has been the tendency to change interest rates more frequently during a forecast
round. This is observable both for the whole MPC and for individuals, and has
become more marked in the 2002-06 period, roughly the second half of the
Committee’s existence. Looking at the minutes of the policy meetings, waiting for
the greater depth of analysis which is possible in a forecast round is sometimes given
as a reason for not changing rates. An example can be found in the minutes for July
5/6 2006: “But there was still considerable uncertainty about the National Accounts
estimates for 2005, which had yet to be balanced. It was difficult to reach firm
conclusions about the implications of the revisions for the overall balance of demand
and supply until the data had been fully analysed in the context of the Inflation Report
round.”

However, I would argue that this is not the only reason for the observed behaviour.
Experience suggests that while the forecasting round frequently does produce analysis
which sheds light on some puzzles, it is just as likely to uncover new uncertainties –

8

Lombardelli et al (2002)

10

indeed the expression ‘confused at a higher level’ is a pretty good description of how I
feel after twenty-three forecast rounds. A slightly different reason for rate changes
occurring more frequently in forecast rounds is that the Committee then has two sorts
of news – the regular flow of data news, plus news about the way in which the
behaviour of the economy may be changing which is revealed through the regular
reconsideration of the performance of the Bank’s model. This second sort of news is
inevitably more difficult for outsiders to anticipate.

Other arguments for waiting for a month or so to gain greater certainty also need to be
used with care. Sometimes there is a specific piece of news expected (for example,
news about the January pay round, which accounts for around 20% of the year’s
private sector settlements, by numbers of employees). This might be a reason for
delaying a decision to change interest rates, if other evidence does not produce a
clear-cut justification.

A similar argument for delay arises around the time of the annual ONS Blue Book,
which often contains significant data revisions. But this is perhaps less easy to
explain - while it is often used as a reason for waiting in the months just ahead of the
Blue Book, it could apply to some extent to any month where a decision was taken on
data which had not been through at least one Blue Book revision, and benefited from
the additional information which the ONS have at that stage. So this becomes part of
the more general issue around data uncertainty, where the MPC is presently seeking to
improve our approach,9 and to strike the right balance by better estimation of how
much of the latest information is likely to be noise rather than news.
Overall, I have come to believe that arguments for waiting in this short-term sense can
be over-emphasised. It is rare for another month’s information to produce much
further clarity.

Only when it is a finely-balanced decision, or when there are

significant concerns about possible reversals (as discussed earlier) should these
factors come into play.

Comparisons with other central banks

9

Ashley et al (2005)

11

Several other central banks operate a similar monetary regime, but they all differ from
each other in terms of their remit, and their institutional structure. Here, I briefly
consider whether these differences also translate into differences in terms of activism.
(Although some caution is needed, as neither the sample size, nor the time period, is
large enough to draw very firm conclusions.)

Taking a sample of eight central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank, over the ten year period of the MPC, all have been similarly
active in terms of interest changes per year (see Table 2). This activity rate does not
seem to be affected by the committee structure (the Bank of England and the Fed are
the only two with individual accountability). All central banks wait longer - on
average four times longer - before moving interest rates in the opposite direction to
the previous move (ie making a reversal).

A tendency to make a policy change more often alongside a forecast is observable for
several other central banks, although this is only statistically significant for the Bank
of England, Reserve Bank of Australia and Reserve Bank of Canada. These banks all
use their forecast as a key means of communicating about policy, although this is also
true of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Riksbank and the Norges Bank, who
have much less of a tendency to be more active at meetings linked to a forecast. It
does not seem to make a difference in this respect if the forecast is ‘owned’ by the
staff of the bank or by the policy makers.

12

The present economic situation

What are the main factors which the MPC is concerned about in the current economic
situation, and to what extent might arguments about gradualism and waiting affect our
decisions in the coming months? From the perspective of output growth, this seems
to be a relatively stable period. Over the recent past, growth has been at around the
rate that most current estimates would consider as the UK’s supply potential; the
period of weaker quarterly growth in early 2005 has been followed by five quarters of
growth around 0.7% or a little stronger. Present survey indicators for output, taken
together, give no reason to suppose that this pace is set to slacken. Indeed, the latest
(February) CBI survey for manufacturing has the strongest output expectations for 12
years. And while the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Managers service sector
survey output indicator has fallen back a little from its December peak, it remains
above the average of the past ten years.

Encouragingly, the outlook for export demand also remains positive – growth in the
euro-area, the UK’s largest market, was 3.3% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2006,
the strongest annual growth rate for six years. And despite growing concerns about
household sector indebtedness in the US, most forecasters still expect growth of over
2.5% for this year, but here we are well aware of the need to be watchful for
indicators of a more significant downward risk for consumer spending.

In the February Inflation Report, the MPC’s central projection for the UK was broadly
for a continuation of the recent pace of growth. But, as we always point out, there are
risks around this central projection. Since the Report was published, there have been
several pieces of news which could alter this outlook. Most notably, around the
beginning of this month there was a bout of turbulence in the equity markets, with
several of the major markets falling by over 5% in a week. At the same time,
associated among other factors with concerns over sub-prime mortgage lending in the
US, credit spreads widened for some riskier assets. This movement certainly needs to
be put into a longer-term context (Chart 4); for example the FTSE All-Share index
rose by over 13% in 2006, and had risen a further 3.5% in 2007 prior to this fall.
Although it has since remained volatile, at the end of last week (16 March) it was little
changed from the level at the time of the previous MPC meeting (7 and 8 March).
13

However, these financial market events, which seemed to be triggered by a
combination of relatively small factors, were a reminder of underlying concerns about
the low level of risk premiums implicit in the low level of real long-term interest
rates, and in low credit spreads on more risky assets.

It has been difficult to

understand exactly what the factors have been driving these movements, and the
associated high levels of asset prices. Consequently, it is not easy to assess the
likelihood of a significant change in the risk premia apparently embedded in current
valuations, with the associated risk of asset price volatility.

There has also been a more mixed picture for data on UK consumer spending. In
2006, quarterly consumer spending growth was quite volatile, but averaged 0.7% per
quarter. Some slowdown in the first quarter of 2007 from the robust growth estimate
for the fourth quarter of 2006 was perhaps to be expected, but the first estimate of
retail sales for January was nevertheless surprisingly weak. While other indicators,
such as business surveys for the retail sector, and indeed the reports of the Bank’s
Agents, painted a stronger picture, I would put some weight on the ONS data.

Additionally, there are some signs that the pickup in house prices growth through
2006 may be levelling out. As reported by the major lenders, monthly house price
growth has continued to be quite strong in January and February. But a less robust
picture is suggested by indicators further back in the purchase timeline, such as the
new buyer enquiries and price expectations in the survey published by the Royal
Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Following three Bank Rate increases since August,
some sign of softening from the consumer and in the housing market is not a surprise,
however. And as yet these are quite tentative and do not convincingly suggest a more
abrupt slowdown than expected.

In any case, while the path of consumer spending will affect overall growth and
therefore the likely balance of demand and supply, it is not risks to growth, but to the
inflation outlook that are of most concern at present. The path of CPI inflation is set
to be quite volatile over the next year or so, and the major question is how this volatile
period may affect where inflation settles around 18 months to two years ahead.

14

Over the next few months, the price cuts recently announced by some major utility
companies will take effect, and there may be further reductions in the pipeline. The
final scale of this is not yet known, but, combined with the fact that last year domestic
utility bills were rising, this may result in quite a sharp fall in the inflation rate, to
below target in the most recent central projection.

However, there are big

uncertainties. Looking back at the period when industrial costs and final inflation
were being driven up by rises in oil and gas prices, the overall CPI rose rather less
than might have been expected. It is likely that weaker demand conditions in 2005,
and perhaps awareness that the MPC remained focussed on keeping inflation at target
in the medium-term, resulted in an environment where firms were cautious about
raising prices. One consequence of this would have been downward pressure on
profitability as input costs rose.

Given this background, as energy prices fall back and growth in the UK and abroad is
robust, it is perhaps not surprising to find that firms’ price expectations have picked
up. The CIPS/RBS services output price series, while volatile, has generally been
above its ten year average for the last six months. And as Chart 5 shows, the CBI
manufacturing survey indicates price expectations in that sector are also at a high
level. Comparing these with the official data for producer prices, price expectations
appear to have been unduly strong in the recent past, but of course the official series is
affected by recent falls in petroleum product prices. Excluding these, producer prices
would show a stronger trend. It may be significant that the recent rise in price
expectations is associated with a rise in a (smoothed) series for plant capacity as a
constraint on output, also drawn from the CBI survey.

Whilst, of course, price expectations are by no means always realised, it seems likely
that there is a little more upward inflation pressure in the short-term than might have
been expected. But this is not easy to interpret. It might for example reflect the fact
that the energy price rise and subsequent partial reversal were feeding through into
final prices more slowly than the central projection allows for. Or, that firms were
taking the opportunity to restore profitability. In these two cases, there might be little
implication for CPI further ahead.

15

But equally this trend might reflect a tighter balance of demand and supply, both
domestically and globally, than we think prevails. The evidence on the domestic
pressure of demand and supply is mixed. The pickup in unemployment from early
2005 to autumn 2006 has only been partially reversed and together with subdued
wage growth suggests a modest amount of slack in the labour market. However,
survey evidence on prices and capacity suggest that firms are perhaps a little above
the trend rate of capacity utilisation. Greater pressure of demand on supply would be
an upward risk to future CPI, particularly if the period of above target inflation
resulted in a rise in inflation expectations among those setting prices.

How does this relate to the earlier discussion of gradualism and waiting? There are
certainly some arguments today for gradualism. For example, the historically high
level of household debt has resulted in some uncertainty about how the consumer will
respond to interest rate changes, and that would support a gradual approach.

But perhaps more importantly, much of our present uncertainty relates to how the UK
economy has responded to the volatility in energy prices, and also to how inflation
expectations may be formed in these circumstances. The price shocks of the past few
years have resulted in a different set of issues for the MPC than the (mostly) demand
shocks of earlier in the decade. Our uncertainty may be of the more fundamental
kind, about whether our present model of the economy will prove a good guide, and in
this case gradualism might be a less appropriate strategy. So interest rates might be
expected to be rather responsive to some kinds of news (for example, news about
inflation expectations, or pricing behaviour), and the behaviour of the MPC might
become more active because of the changing economic circumstances.

The period of financial market turbulence has also highlighted another feature of my
time on the MPC. There are some risks which the MPC has frequently discussed over
the past six years, such as a disorderly adjustment of the large US current account
deficit, or a significant fall in sterling prompted by the UK’s own current account
deficit. Other ‘big risks’ which have surfaced during this period include a sharp fall
in the UK housing market, related to worries over rising household debt. The impact
on inflation for these risks would come from large movements in financial markets or
asset prices, and in my view these developments can only be responded to when they
16

occur. In some cases I have spent all six years waiting for these risks to crystallise –
and remain ready to respond if they do.

But obviously not all risks are of that type. In contrast, I have also experienced
several periods of concern about significant upward pressure on wages. However, in
fact, the past six years have generally seen remarkable stability for earnings, and even
in the present wage round, despite taking place against a background of higher
inflation, the early indicators are that pay pressures have only picked up a little –
although we cannot as yet take this for granted. In this case monetary policy has
probably been able to affect the outcome, due to clear understanding among wage
bargainers of our commitment to the inflation target, and evidence that policy does
respond to inflation risks arising from pay (in either direction).

Conclusions

As the MPC approaches its tenth birthday, it is possible to look at how its behaviour
in practice measures up against the theoretical account of how monetary policy
decisions should be taken, and how committees are likely to behave. In taking a
decision each month, the key question is always whether the latest news amounts to a
case for change – a question that I find no easier to answer after six years on the MPC
than I did at the first meeting. While the news over the month itself can generally be
quantified, uncertainty about exactly how this news will affect the economy in coming
quarters, and also about the data itself, means that it is not always appropriate to react
fully.

Empirical work looking back at the MPC’s behaviour compared to the predictions
from a simple Taylor rule (in which the interest rate responds to movements in
inflation and in estimates of the pressure of demand on supply) suggests that the MPC
appears to have been only slightly more responsive to news than policymakers in the
UK over the previous twenty years. But an extension of the Taylor rule has been
estimated to allow for variables ‘unobserved’ in the simple rule (such as financial
conditions, or real time data), which are likely to have affected policy decisions. In
this case, policy during the past ten years seems to have been substantially less
gradual.
17

Estimates of forward-looking Taylor rules also suggest a less gradual approach, as
policy appears to have responded quite aggressively to offset predicted deviations of
inflation from target. However, it is possible that this is a little misleading. I consider
it likely that the forecast itself can respond to news in a gradual manner – in particular
to asset price news which tends to be volatile and where there is a good argument for
not responding to every shift in the market. But the general conclusion is that the
MPC does not seem to have behaved in a particularly gradualist manner.

Comparisons with other inflation-targeting central banks suggest that two features of
MPC behaviour are shared more widely. Policymakers seem to be slow to change
policy in a new direction, because of concerns about loss of credibility if there has to
be an early reversal of direction. Over the past ten years a sample of eight central
banks with similar monetary regimes have waited on average four times as long
before making a policy reversal, as before deciding to move interest rates further in
the same direction.

Another aspect of behaviour which is similar across the central banks is a tendency to
make changes in interest rates more frequently when producing a new forecast,
although this has been the most marked in the case of the UK. However, some
behaviours will also change over time (the MPC has tended to become less activist
through its ten-year life, but this may partly be due to the changing economic
environment), and in this case too much weight should not be put on past patterns of
behaviour when making predictions.

A noticeable feature of MPC voting patterns is that external members have been more
active on average than internal (although, rather to my surprise, I personally have
been relatively inactive). It is difficult to pin down reasons for this, although it would
be plausible to suggest that externals will often bring with them different ideas about
policy strategy, and that therefore the present mix of members, and turnover of
members, is healthy in preventing any tendency towards complacency.

Turning to the present economic situation, it could be summed up as a central
projection of robust and rather stable growth. There is a strong outlook for exports,
18

which should be positive news for this region. But there is considerable uncertainty
about inflation, both the short-term path and where the inflation rate will settle in the
medium-term. The main risks to the growth projection are around the outlook for the
household sector in the US, and in the UK, with worries in both cases around the
housing market and high debt levels. However, in the UK there are so far only
tentative indications of weaker consumer spending, or of a softening housing market.

For inflation, while short-term uncertainty is mainly due to the domestic energy
market, and may be resolved over the next few months, the medium-term uncertainty
is more pervasive. This is related chiefly to how the cost shock from past energy
price rises has fed through into final prices, in the UK and globally, and to uncertainty
about what is driving the present indicators of upward pricing pressure in the business
surveys. This is a different kind of uncertainty from worries about demand which
have been more usual during my time on the MPC, and I suggest that this may prompt
a change in observed behaviour towards more frequent interest rate changes. Over the
next few months, I will be monitoring these price surveys, and other indicators of
inflation expectations, particularly closely.
