Speech by

DAVID MILES
MEMBER OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
BANK OF ENGLAND

Monetary Policy and Financial Stability

A version of this speech was given to the Bristol Business Forum on
Wednesday 14 July 2010

I would like to thank Conall MacCoille and Gilberto Marcheggiano for research assistance and I am
also grateful for helpful comments from other colleagues. The views expressed are my own and do not
necessarily reflect those of the Bank of England or other members of the Monetary Policy Committee.

Monetary Policy in the UK has never been as expansionary as it is today. Just over 15
months ago the level of Bank Rate was reduced to what is – to all intents and
purposes – its floor. As Chart 1 rather starkly shows, this is the lowest level to which
Bank Rate has fallen since the Bank of England was established at the end of the
seventeenth century. Bank Rate has not been changed for 16 consecutive meetings of
the MPC. That is not so unusual. In fact, as the Chart reveals, between 1720 and
1820 Bank Rate did not move from 5%. Had a Monetary Policy Committee then met
each month, as it does now, it would have decided at 1200 consecutive meetings not
to change the level of interest rates. So it is far from unusual for the interest rate set by
the Bank to remain constant for over a year. And for much of the period since rates
fell to the floor, policy has been actively changed – asset purchases have built up to
now stand at around £200 billion.

So it is the level to which interest rates have fallen that is unprecedented. I believe it
has been right to loosen aggressively the stance of monetary policy because of the
scale of the deflationary and recessionary forces unleashed by the remarkably rapid
downturn that followed the crisis in the banking sector.

This crisis intensified

dramatically in the autumn of 2008 when the banking system came close to total
collapse. That would have been an outcome comparable in its impact to the failure of
the system for electricity supply. Many now argue that monetary policy should be set
in a different way so as to reduce the chances of this sort of banking crisis. That is
2

one of the issues I want to discuss today. The argument that the aims of monetary
policy need to be broadened beyond a focus on inflation is one that deserves to be
taken seriously because the damage done by extreme financial instability is great. If
there were no tools better suited to help preserve financial stability than varying
interest rates then the case for broadening the goals of monetary policy would be
strong. But I believe there are tools better suited to make the financial system more
robust and I want to consider one of them – capital requirements – and how they
might in future interact with monetary policy.

More immediately, problems and fragilities in the banking sector remain and pose
risks that the recovery in demand and activity we have seen across Europe – including
in the UK – falters. But in the UK we have also seen CPI inflation rise to a level that
is significantly above the inflation target. In recent months CPI inflation has begun to
fall, but remains well above the 2% target level and that makes setting monetary
policy difficult.

We continue to face the problem of balancing risks: risks that

inflation of 1.0pp-1.5pp above target lasts long enough to become ingrained in
expectations and affect behaviour so that it is hard to bring down, versus risks that the
recovery in output becomes weaker and then disappears, leaving inflation pressures
lower than is consistent with the target further ahead.

Since the financial crisis towards the end of 2008 economic policy has been unusually
hard to manage.

Both monetary and fiscal policy have been exceptionally

expansionary. There has been an extremely large fiscal deficit. Fiscal policy is now
being tightened. I look forward to the day when it will be appropriate to tighten
monetary policy since a return to more normal levels of interest rates would be a
welcome sign that economic conditions were also more normal. But I do not think
that is where we are today.
So since I joined the MPC just over a year ago I have not voted to increase interest
rates – despite the fact that inflation has more often than not been above the target.
But even though price rises over the past year have been running at relatively high
levels, the underlying domestic inflationary pressures are not strong. Wage rises –
despite a move up in household inflation expectations – remain low. Without a pick
up in wage inflation I find it hard to think it at all likely that inflation being
3

significantly above target is sustainable.

Of course wage pressures may build

significantly over the next year or so, though I do not believe this is the most likely
outcome. And risks of an extended period of low growth – which would further
weaken those pressures – are real.
In talking about the possibility of an extended period of low, or no, growth I may
sound blasé about inflation risks. But the point about risks is that more than one can
exist. There are risks that inflation stays well above the target level; there are also
risks that demand in the economy falls even more below supply capacity so that
inflation further ahead drifts below the target. In considering how to balance these
risks there is a need to look through short run and potentially transitory factors.
Reacting to today’s inflation rate (which reflects where the level of prices is now
relative to 12 months ago), rather than where inflation will be looking ahead, is not
the right thing to do. The inflation rate can move a lot in a short period. Inflation was
barely 1% less than a year ago.
But this is a difficult situation to have to deal with. I dislike clichés so will resist the
temptation to talk about the ship having being blown near to the rocks and now
having to steer a difficult course in treacherous waters with rather out of date maps
that have not been updated since no-one expected we would be in such a place. But it
is a temptation since it is not a bad analogy.

How we came to be in this difficult situation is something on which many books have
already been written. At the heart of the problems has been a banking system which
proved catastrophically fragile. That fragility reflected the fact that many banks had
come to have very high leverage – a lot of debt relative to capital – which made them
vulnerable to concerns about losses on their assets.
This poses a big and obvious question: how do we reduce the fragility of the banking
system in a way that does not come at too high price – a price may come in the form
of a lower level of overall economic activity? And should we change the goal of
monetary policy to include a wider range of objectives that include maintaining the
stability of the banking sector?

4

Why were banks so fragile?
On the eve of the crisis we had come to be in a situation where the capital of UK
banks, relative to their assets, was around half the level that was typical fifty years
earlier and probably around one third the level that was usual one hundred years ago
(Chart 2). In the US the decline in bank capital over the past one hundred years is
quite probably even larger.

to 1968 the ratio is calculated as the liquid assets of the London
Clearing Banks as a percentage of gross deposits, as defined in 'The
British Economy, Key Statistics 1900-1970'.

Furthermore, in recent years the quality of banks’ capital deteriorated as banks
exploited the availability of new hybrid capital instruments which often had the tax
advantages of debt. In practice hybrid capital did not absorb banks’ losses despite
being treated for regulatory purposes as if it was like equity.

The liquidity of banks, as measured by the ratio of their most liquid assets (central
bank reserves, gilts and Treasury bills) relative to total assets, was a fraction of what
had been normal twenty years earlier and a tiny fraction of what had been normal
before the 1970’s (Chart 3). And banks had also become larger. Their assets, relative
to the size of the economy, had grown very sharply. Relative to GDP, they had
roughly doubled in the 10 years up to 2007 (Chart 4).

The UK banking sector had low capital, illiquid assets and was very large when fears
about the value of its assets increased. The combination of those things accounts for
the scale of the damage that ensued.

There are many different proposals to build a more robust banking sector. Some of
these involve using conventional monetary policy, that is interest rates. But most
1

6

proposals are about changes to the way banks do business. These range from those
requiring banks to hold somewhat higher capital and liquidity ratios to much stricter
capital and liquidity requirements; but they also include more fundamental changes to
the financial architecture that would preclude banks from undertaking many types of
business.

It may seem inappropriate to present these alternative proposals on a

continuous spectrum. Some are about altering balance sheet structure (capital and
liquidity requirements) and others focus on limits on the activities banks can pursue.
But in practice I think many of the proposals can be seen to lie on a continuous
spectrum. This is because stopping a bank from undertaking an activity and insisting
that it be (in the limit) completely equity financed are quite close. One can think of a
bank as an entity that finances its acquisition of assets with substantial use of debt
finance. By setting capital standards on a type of business high enough one prevents
it being financed with much debt; that comes close to making it an activity banks
cannot do.

Amongst the most radical proposals for creating a less fragile financial structure are
those of Laurence Kotlikoff2. The Kotlikoff proposal is – in essence – to turn the
funding of the vast majority of what are now assets on bank balance sheets (largely
loans) into equity claims. This could be seen as equivalent to imposing 100% capital
ratios. It would mean that banks would, to the extent they continued to hold the loans
that they make, be more like unit trusts with an origination arm rather than banks.

So many – in fact almost all – of the proposals to make banks less fragile will mean
they would come to hold more equity capital. I think this is right. And I believe it is
the most fundamental response to banking fragility because it directly deals with
solvency problems – risks that people who have lent money don’t get it back. I
believe that those risks – real or perceived – have been the fundamental drivers of the
financial disasters of the past few years. Other problems, which are sometimes
described as funding or liquidity problems, often arise because of fears about
solvency.

I do not want to imply that other measures to make the financial sector more stable –
including liquidity requirements and changes to the way asset values are assessed and
reported – are not important. But I want to consider whether changes in capital are a
powerful tool to make the banking sector robust and whether it is right to see them,
rather than monetary policy, as a more natural means to that end.

Some are sceptical that higher capital requirements can work because banks may be
able to avoid (or evade) them. If capital requirements are increased significantly, but
only on some activities, banks may re-classify assets to switch their business into
forms where the capital requirements are no higher than today. To me that is an
argument for thinking about very substantial rises in required bank capital pretty
much across the full range of their activities. Of course if this is very costly it will
create two problems: it would create big incentives to avoid them and potentially big
costs to the wider economy, because of the impact on the price and availability of
bank loans.

Two issues are important. First, the scale of the impact on bank funding costs from
higher capital requirements. Higher funding costs would push up on the cost of bank
loans to households and non-financial companies and affect lending and investment,
which in turn could require a monetary policy response; those costs will also affect
the incentives to avoid (or evade) capital requirements. The second issue is how
much more robust the financial sector, and banks in particular, become with different
amounts of extra capital.

Several estimates of the cost of higher bank capital exist.

The Institute for

International Finance (IIF) suggest that proposed regulatory reform which could be
part of the Basle III system could reduce the path of average annual GDP growth in
the US, euro area and Japan by 0.3pp for the next ten years3. This implies that the
level of GDP would ultimately be around 3% lower. If we use a real discount rate of
3

‘Interim Report on the Cumulative Impact on the Global Economy of Proposed Changes in Banking
Regulatory Framework’, Institute for International Finance, 2010.
The report assumes: a three-fold increase in the risk weights assigned to trading book assets; a 2pp
increase in the minimum Tier 1 and overall regulatory capital ratios, to 6% and 10%, respectively, to
take place at the end of 2012; capital redefinition effects including exclusion of minority interest from
Tier 1; higher holdings of liquid assets as a result of the minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio being
increased; a greater reliance on longer-term over short-term wholesale funding, as a result of the Net
Stable Funding Ratio at 100%.

2.5% a year, the present value of a permanent fall in output of 3% is in excess of
100% of current annual GDP. This is at the high end of estimates of the cost of
higher capital requirements.

Recent analysis by economists from the National

Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), commissioned by the FSA, puts
the present value of the costs of permanently raising capital requirements by 1% at
approximately 2.7% of current GDP4. And illustrative estimates in the most recent
Bank of England Financial Stability Report (FSR) indicate, under certain conservative
assumptions, that the long run costs could amount to 4% of current annual GDP in
present value terms, though it also finds that the GDP benefits from increasing capital
requirements from their current level substantially outweigh these costs5.

The NIESR and FSR estimates look much lower than the IIF figure. But the IIF
estimate is for the impact of a range of adjustments which include a more than 1% rise
in bank capital. Nonetheless that estimate looks likely to be higher than the illustrative
calculation in the FSR. But rather than seeing the FSR calculations as generating a
very low estimate of the cost of higher capital requirements, I think they are more
likely to be a conservative assessment that reflects the care taken not to underestimate
the cost of higher bank capital.

The costs of extra bank capital
Many assessments from commentators and practitioners, though often not precisely
quantified, suggest that the costs of significantly higher capital requirements for banks
are very substantial. I am rather sceptical about the claims that substantially higher
capital requirements must mean significantly higher costs of funds for those who
borrow to invest and that total investment and output in the economy will be
significantly lower.

See Barrell, R, Davis, E, Fic, T, Holland, D, Kirby, S, and Liadze, I (2009), ‘Optimal regulation of
bank capital and liquidity: how to calibrate new international standards’, FSA Occasional Paper 38.
The paper indicates that a 1% rise in capital requirements could reduce output by 0.08% of GDP in the
long run. Discounted at a rate of 3% this would imply a 2.7% reduction in current GDP.

See Box 7 in chapter 5 of Bank of England, Financial Stability Report, June 2010. The 4% cost is for
a 1% rise in banks’ capital as a proportion of risk-weighted assets.

There are two reasons for my scepticism.

First, a simple historical point. In the UK and in the USA economic performance was
not obviously far worse when banks held very much higher levels of capital.
Investment – relative to GDP – was not lower. This is prime facie evidence that much
higher levels of bank capital do not cripple development, and the financing of
investment. Conversely, there is little evidence that investment or the average (or
potential) growth rate of the UK economy picked up as spreads on bank lending
narrowed over the past decade, and the volume of bank credit expanded sharply
(Chart 5).

Second, the most straightforward and logically consistent model of the overall impact
of higher equity capital (and less debt) on the total cost of finance of a company
implies that the effect is zero. The Modigliani Miller (MM) theorem implies that as
more equity capital is raised the volatility of the return on that equity falls, and the
safety of the debt rises, so that the required rate of return on both sources of funds
falls.

It does so in such a way that the weighted average cost of finance is

unchanged6. It is absolutely NOT self-evident that requiring banks to hold more

Investment". American Economic Review 48 (3): 261–297.

capital has to substantially increase their costs and must mean that they need to charge
substantially more on loans to service the providers of their funds.

There are certainly reasons why the Modigliani Miller result is unlikely to hold
exactly. The Modigliani-Miller theorem may not hold for banks because of
asymmetric information problems in financial markets. But I will argue that one of the
most obvious reasons why it does not hold (differential tax treatment of debt and
equity) need not imply that there is a wider economic cost to be paid for higher capital
requirements on banks.

Indeed, recent research suggests that the Modigliani-Miller theorem might not be a
bad approximation even for banks. Kashyap et al find that the long-run steady state
impact on bank loan rates from increases in external equity finance is modest, in the
range of 25-45 basis points for a ten percentage point increase in capital
requirements7. They also find that the costs of capital requirements are greater if they
are phased in very quickly.

I want to briefly describe some ways of trying to calibrate the costs and benefits of
higher capital requirements – which do not assume the MM theorem holds. The
method I use follows that outlined in the recent Bank of England FSR8.

The

methodology followed in the FSR seems to me very sensible. The idea is to calculate
the impact of a given change in equity capital – that is an equity for debt swap – on a
typical bank’s cost of funding. I assume, as in the FSR, the higher cost of bank
funding is passed on in the form of a higher cost of bank loans. To assess what effect
that has on the wider economy we then make an educated guess at the effect of a rise
in the cost of bank loans on the overall required return on investment. That in turn
will affect the stock of capital and economic activity. This impact on economic
activity is the cost of higher capital requirements.

The illustrative estimates in the FSR indicate that conservative assumptions about
effects of higher bank capital on the costs of bank funding and lending generate a
marginal cost of about 4% of annual GDP, in present value terms, for a 1% of risk7

See Kashyap ,K., Stein, J. and Hanson, S. “An Analysis of the Impact of “Substantially Heightened”
Capital Requirements on Large Financial Institutions”, Working Paper.

weighted assets rise in capital. The FSR notes that by relaxing these assumptions the
cost may be lower, so that the estimates are probably an upper bound9.

The starting point for my calculations is the case presented in the FSR. This is that
the cost of a 1% rise in banks’ capital relative to their risk weighted assets would
reduce annual GDP by about 0.1%. At a discount rate of 2.5% this implies that the
present value of this loss in output over all future periods is 4.25% of current annual
GDP10. I illustrate that less conservative assumptions imply a much smaller estimated
cost of higher bank capital requirements. Specifically, I sequentially take account of:

1. the possibility that if a bank has more equity capital the return on equity is less
variable lowering the required rate of return. (This is a partial allowance for
the mechanism underlying the Modigliani-Miller result.)
2. the likelihood that the extra tax revenue that accrues to the government as
banks are forced to switch to equity that is less favourably treated is used to
offset any resultant rise in the cost of finance for companies using bank debt.
(For example the government could use the extra revenue to increase capital
allowances so that the negative impact on investment from a higher cost of
bank debt is neutralised.)
3. the likelihood that the relative importance of bank funding for investment is
lower than the baseline conservative estimate that banks account for 1/3 of
private, non-financial companies (PNFCs) external finance.
4. the likelihood that the sensitivity of investment and the capital stock to a rise
in the cost of funds to non-financial firms is lower than the value assumed in
the baseline (where an assumption of a unit elasticity of substitution between
capital and labour is used).

Suppose we first allow the cost of equity to fall as more capital reduces its volatility.
I only allow for a partial offset relative to what the Modigliani Miller theorem implies
– in fact I assume the offset is only 30% as great, which means that the weighted
9

In particular, it notes that the costs may be over-estimated because the calculations assume that the
Modigliani-Miller theorem does not hold and because they use a Cobb-Douglas production function to
compute the reaction of output to changes in firms’ cost of capital
10
Underlying these calculations are assumptions that the cost of equity and debt are 10% and 5%
respectively and remain fixed. Our baseline calculations are similar, but slightly higher than those in
the June 2010 Financial Stability Report.

12

average cost of cost of capital rises by 70% of the baseline11. Making this adjustment
reduces the estimated present value of the cost of permanently higher bank capital by
about 1% of annual GDP – from just over 4% to 3%.

The major part of this remaining cost reflects that fact that we assume that all interest
paid by banks on debt they raise is tax deductible at the corporation tax rate (of 28%)
while equity capital has to earn the required rate of return out of post tax profits. But
in thinking about the wider economic impact of a switch to less tax sheltered funding
for banks we need to take account of the extra revenue generated for the government.
The government could use the extra tax revenue it gets from banks to shelter the users
of bank loans from any knock on impact on their cost of raising finance. This seems a
natural assumption to make. And it would mean that we should reduce the estimated
negative impact on economic activity. When we allow for this the cost – in terms of
the lost output of a permanent change to bank capital of +1% of assets – almost halves
from just over 3% of annual GDP to about 1.7%

Next I allow for less than 30% of investment in the economy to be financed by bank
lending. PNFCs’ liabilities with banks are made up of direct loans from banks’, but
also banks’ holding of corporate bonds and equities, issued by PNFCs. I assume that
only PNFCs’ bank loans are affected by the increase in banks’ funding costs. Chart 5
illustrates that over the past year the share of bank loans in PNFCs financial liabilities
has declined from close to 20% to close to its average over the past two decades of
16%.

Allowing for this halves again the estimated cost of higher bank capital – which falls
from around 1.7% to 0.8% of annual GDP. This estimate is based on the impact of
higher cost of bank lending feeding through to a (Cobb-Douglas) production function,
and that implies a high sensitivity of investment to the cost of funds (a unit elasticity
of substitution between capital and labour). Bank of England research12 suggests that
this elasticity is probably substantially lower. If that elasticity is 0.4, which looks a
central estimate, then the cost of higher bank capital (of 1% of assets) falls from 0.8%

11

This means that the required return on equity falls from 10% to 8.9%.

of England Working Paper. No. 348.

How do these costs measure against the benefits of a more robust banking sector and
a lower frequency of banking crises? I will make the same assumptions as in the
FSR, namely that if a bank crisis occurs the initial impact is to reduce output by 10%
of GDP. That is almost exactly the amount by which UK GDP is now below the level
it would have reached had it continued on the trajectory it was on up to 2007. I
assume that three quarters of this reduction lasts for just five years, but that the other
2.5% of lost GDP is gone forever. Under these assumptions, and using the same
discount rate of 2.5%, the present value of reducing the likelihood of a systematic
crisis in any one year by one percentage point is around 55% of current annual GDP.
If we instead assumed that there are no permanent effects on GDP from financial
crises the benefits of reducing the chance of a crisis happening in a year are lower at
around 20% of GDP (Table 1, column 2).

The third column in the table shows by how much the chances of a banking crisis
would need to fall given a rise in capital of 1% of bank assets so that the benefits of
that would match the estimated cost. (Whereas before both benefit and cost are
expressed as the present value of lost or gained GDP.) This is the reduction in the
probability of a banking crisis required to justify a 1% increase in banks’ riskweighted capital – given the assumptions made on tax, Modigliani Miller offsets and
so on corresponding to that row in the Table. Chart 7 illustrates this calculation for
multiples of a 1% increase in banks’ capital.

For example, on the least favourable assumptions about the cost of extra bank capital
(corresponding to row 1 in the table) the Chart shows that a 10% increase in banks’
capital ratios would require a minimum reduction in the probability of financial crises
of 0.8 (the red line) for it to pass a cost-benefit test. If we assume that financial crises
would otherwise occur once in every 25 years (an annual frequency of 4%) then a rise
in banks capital by 10 of risk-weighted assets would be justified if it reduced the
probability of financial crises so that they occurred with an annual probability of
3.2%, or once every 31 years. Alternatively, taking the most favourable assumptions
on cost (full tax offsets, partial Modigliani Miller offsets, a lower use of bank debt
and lower sensitivity of investment spending) the blue line indicates a 10% rise in
capital relative to assets would be justified if it reduced the probability of financial
crises from 4% a year to 3.9%, or from once every 25 years to once every 25.4 years.
15

(The final column in the table shows that calculation for each case). Such a small
decline in the likelihood of a financial crisis would not appear to be overly ambitious
for such a sharp rise in the capital ratio. For typical banks the capital ratio starts out
from a level under 10%, so that a rise in capital of 10% of risk assets is more than a
doubling in the amount of bank capital.

additional capital as % of banks' risk-weighted assets -

That said, initial increases in banks’ capital will probably have a much more
pronounced impact on the likelihood of financial crises than successive increases. For
example, a 5 percentage point increase in banks capital from 15% to 20% would
likely have considerably less impact on the probability of banks’ failing than raising
capital from 10% to 15%. So it is important to consider the rate at which the marginal
benefits of banks holding more capital will diminish. The June 2010 Financial
Stability Report provides illustrative estimates that indicate the benefits of additional
capital fall to close to zero once a threshold of around 15% of risk-weighted assets is
reached.

It is difficult to predict the likely volatility of banks’ assets values and the probability
of extreme events that could lead to a financial crisis. A natural starting point is to
assume that the shocks hitting the economy and banks’ asset values follow a normal
distribution.

However, a distribution with ‘fatter tails’ would imply a greater
16

likelihood of extreme events and hence potentially larger benefits from higher capital
requirements.

It seems pretty unlikely to me that the distribution of risks that affects banks follows a
normal distribution. A much better way to match the distribution of risks that end up
affecting GDP is to assume that most of the time risks – or shocks – follow a normal
distribution but that once every few decades a shock comes that is very large. The
frequency of such large shocks is very much greater than would be implied by an
estimated normal distribution that most of the time matches the GDP data well. This
assumption is one made by Robert Barro in a series of important studies of rare events
that hit economies14.

A few years ago I calibrated a version of the Barro model so as to match historical
experience15. I used a very large sample of countries and data going back some 200
years. Using data on the annual change in GDP for this sample of countries gave over
4000 observations of historical economic growth. The best fit of the data I could find
– and it did fit the data extremely well (Chart 8 see below) – implied that 95% of the
time the shock to annual GDP was well behaved and came from a normal distribution
with a fairly small volatility (a standard deviation of about 3%).

About once every 20 years, on average, a shock came along which could be either
very good or very bad; it either increased or decreased GDP by around 12%. Much
less frequently there came a very much larger – and always negative – hit to GDP.
On average this very bad shock came along about once a century; reducing GDP by
over 30%. In this type of mode,l first developed by Barro, the shocks to GDP are
permanent and so could be expected to affect asset values by comparable magnitudes.
So once we allow for rare – but very big – shocks that do not follow a normal
distribution then there will be larger benefits from banks having much more capital.
And without allowing for such shocks it is not possible to explain the historical
variability of economic activity across countries.

In summary, even taking a conservative view of the cost of extra bank capital the net
benefits of stricter capital requirements are potentially large. But relaxing these
conservative assumptions implies the costs of higher capital requirements are likely to
be much lower. Furthermore, the benefits of capital requirements are likely to be
considerable, especially if one does not assume that the shocks to economic output
and banks’ asset values follow a normal distribution.

The implications for monetary policy
I conclude from this that there are likely to be substantial benefits in having banks
hold much more capital. Under plausible assumptions that would have a relatively
low impact on the overall cost of debt in the economy but a big impact on the
robustness of the banking system. In all the calculations described above I have been
focussing on steady states and looking at the long run impacts of banks coming to
have much more capital. I think those results mean that it would be desirable that
banks come to hold much more capital. It is conceivable that raising large amounts of
additional capital in a short period may be more costly. So the transition to higher
levels of capital should probably be relatively long.
18

Clearly more stringent capital requirements on banks will be part of any new
regulatory framework. I believe that moving capital requirements on banks is a very
useful tool to work alongside monetary policy in achieving a stable economic
environment. But there are other tools such as time-varying liquidity standards or
limits on loan-to-value ratios on secured lending that could be used to limit the growth
of credit over the cycle. However, it is not my role as a member of the MPC to
comment on the exact design of macro-prudential instruments.

But I do believe there is a strong case for having monetary policy tools – which for
most of the time means the level of interest rates – set to achieve stability in nominal
conditions; which means that they are focused on inflation. Using the interest rate as
a tool to maintain the stability of the banking system strikes me as a strange
assignment of policy tools to targets. Changes in interest rates have an uncertain
impact on financial stability; often it would be unclear in which direction to move
interest rates to help make the banking sector more robust. But in the UK changes in
interest rates have a powerful – and relatively predictable – impact on the wider
economy.

In contrast capital requirements may have a powerful and relatively clear impact on
bank robustness and an uncertain – but quite likely relatively small – impact on the
wider economy. So it seems to me natural to use interest rates as the active tool to
affect the balance between demand and supply in the economy – and so control
inflation pressures – and use capital requirements to maintain stability in the banking
sector. Regulating bank capital is a natural means for achieving a stable financial
system because it directly affects the fragility of the banking sector.

If banks do come to hold much more capital this would make the job of setting
monetary policy easier. It would do so by reducing the chances of banking crises.
We have had to live with the effects of such a crisis over the past few years; they have
included great variability in output and unusual (by the standards of the previous ten
years) volatility in inflation. But it is a non sequitur that because monetary policy
would be much more effective if banking crises were much less common then
monetary policy is the right tool to make the financial system more robust. Capital
requirements are a better means to that end.
