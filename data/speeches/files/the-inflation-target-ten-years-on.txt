THE INFLATION TARGET TEN YEARS ON
Mervyn King
Deputy Governor, Bank of England

1. Introduction

Ten years ago, in this very room, Robin Leigh Pemberton (then Governor, now
Lord Kingsdown), delivered the first LSE-Bank of England Lecture. It was entitled
“The Case for Price Stability”. In the twenty-five years prior to that lecture, prices
had risen by over 750%, more than over the previous two hundred and fifty years. So
the audience on that evening in November 1992 had grown up in a world in which
rapidly rising prices appeared inevitable. They were the inflation generation. To
them price stability seemed remote. Inflation was simply taken for granted.

But that LSE-Bank of England Lecture coincided with the introduction of a new
monetary framework – the inflation target. Since then price stability has become a
reality. Over the past decade inflation has averaged 2.5%, and has been no lower than
1.5% and no higher than 3.3%

Alan Greenspan defined price stability as when “expected changes in the average
price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter
business and household decisions.” With inflation expected to remain close to 2.5%,
it is no longer a material concern to families and businesses in this country. Alan
Blinder, who was Alan Greenspan’s deputy at the Federal Reserve Board, put it even
more clearly. Price stability, he said, was when ordinary people stop talking and
worrying about inflation. And so successful has been the pursuit of low inflation that
some commentators have talked about the “death of inflation” and others have
become increasingly concerned about the prospect of deflation.

Tonight I want to re-examine the case for price stability, and ask the following
questions. Did the benefits of low inflation promised ten years ago materialise? Is
the case for price stability the same as in 1992? What does price stability mean in

2

practice? Finally, what are the challenges for monetary policy over the next decade?

2. Ten Years of the Inflation Target: what has it achieved?

Since Britain’s departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992,
monetary policy has been based on an explicit numerical target for the rate of inflation
– now 2.5% – and a high degree of transparency and accountability. Indeed, it was in
his LSE lecture that Lord Kingsdown announced that the first Inflation Report would
appear in February 1993. And last week’s Report completes exactly a decade of
Inflation Reports – forty assessments of the outlook for growth and inflation in the
British economy.

Although inflation targeting in the United Kingdom is now ten years old, the most
significant institutional changes occurred five years ago. Decisions on interest rates
were taken out of the political arena in May 1997 and delegated by the Chancellor to
the new Monetary Policy Committee. It is too soon to compare the nine-member
Monetary Policy Committee with the Council of Nine that ruled Siena during the
fourteenth century. Exactly 660 years before the Chancellor created the MPC, the
Council of Nine commissioned Lorenzetti to paint the marvellous frescoes in the
Palazzo Pubblico showing the virtues of Good Government and the vices of Bad
Government. There are few more convincing representations of the case for stability
than those frescoes. Since the MPC has not, at least yet, discovered a modern
Lorenzetti, I shall present the case for price stability in a more orthodox, if less
compelling, visual form.

Chart 1 shows consumer price inflation in this country over the past fifty years. The
decade of inflation targeting stands out as a period of low and stable inflation.
Table 1 shows that not only has inflation been lower since inflation targeting was
introduced, but that, as measured by its standard deviation, it has also been more
stable than in recent decades. Moreover, inflation has been less persistent – in the
sense that shocks to inflation die away more quickly – under inflation targeting than
for most of the past century.

Now this fall in inflation has led to sharp reductions in nominal interest rates, at both
short and long time horizons, as shown in Table 2. That reflects both lower inflation
expectations and smaller risk premia to compensate for future inflation uncertainty.
The total inflation premium – the sum of expected inflation and the inflation risk
premium – is measured by the difference between yields on conventional and indexlinked government securities. Chart 2 shows that the total inflation premium fell
significantly on the announcement of Bank of England independence and the creation
of the MPC. It is highly suggestive of a fall not just in expected inflation but also in
the inflation risk premium. In principle, the behaviour of businesses and households
depends on real interest rates – nominal interest rates less the expected increase in
prices. 2 To the extent that the inflation risk premium falls, then so too does the level
of real interest rates. The evidence in Chart 2 suggests that real rates have fallen too,
although by less than nominal rates.

So price stability appears to have led to a more stable macro economic environment,
with fewer surprises to inflation, less inflation uncertainty, and a lower level of real
interest rates. Has this improved nominal performance led to greater stability of the
real economy? Table 3 shows that since 1992, output has grown at a little above its
forty year average, and has been much more stable than before. The standard
deviation of quarterly growth rates over the past decade was less than half that in
earlier periods.

Can these gains in terms of greater stability be attributed to a more stable monetary
regime? After all, a sceptic might argue that the causation runs from a more stable
economic environment to lower inflation. But some of these alternative explanations,
such as the rise in the share of services in total output and better inventory
management, are part of longer-term trends and do not fit well with the observation
that volatility has fallen sharply over the past decade. And shocks to the UK from the
world economy and from the sterling real exchange rate have been as large, if not
larger, over the past five years as in earlier periods. 3

It is, of course, difficult to identify the effect of changes in the monetary policy
regime on the path of total output. One approach is to consider long runs of data

4

which make it easier to identify structural breaks in the behaviour of output. Luca
Benati of the Bank of England has been investigating the statistical properties of
inflation over long periods for a number of countries. He finds that changes in the
behaviour of inflation appear broadly to coincide with changes in the monetary policy
regime. Some tentative evidence that this general conclusion applies to the UK can be
found in the behaviour of ten-year forward interest rates on UK government bonds.
At this horizon, high and variable interest rates are signs of high expected inflation
and a large inflation risk premium. As shown in Chart 3, the ten-year forward interest
rate has fallen significantly in recent years, and has been less variable since inflation
targeting, and especially the MPC, were introduced.

What is the mechanism by which monetary policy contributes to a more stable
economy? I would argue that monetary policy is now more systematic and
predictable than before. Inflation expectations are anchored to the 2.5% target.
Businesses and families expect that monetary policy will react to offset shocks that
are likely to drive inflation away from target. In the jargon of economists, the “policy
reaction function” of the Bank of England is more stable and predictable than was the
case before inflation targeting, and easier to understand. 4 More simply, monetary
policy is not adding to the volatility of the economy in a way that it did in earlier
decades.

3. The Case for Price Stability: what have we learnt over the past 10 years?

The costs of departing from price stability – either inflation or deflation – depend
upon whether it is expected or comes as a surprise. In his 1992 lecture, Lord
Kingsdown distinguished three costs of unanticipated inflation and four of anticipated
inflation. I shall focus on the former, commenting on the latter only briefly.
Although none of the ideas are new, research since 1992 has thrown new light on both
the theoretical and the empirical relevance of the costs of inflation. The main costs of
unanticipated inflation are:

(i)

Distortions to production and investment resulting from mistakes in
distinguishing between relative and absolute price changes

5

The crucial link between price stability and production and investment is that high
inflation is associated with more volatile and uncertain inflation. I showed earlier that
as inflation has fallen in Britain, so too has its variability. The same link can be seen
in cross-section data. Chart 4 shows the relationship between average inflation and its
variability, measured by its coefficient of variation, over different time horizons for a
sample of 144 countries. In all cases it is clear that inflation uncertainty increases
with the average inflation rate.

But does this link between inflation and its volatility mean that higher inflation results
in greater variability of relative prices? Chart 5 provides the answer for the UK. For
each (approximate) decade for which the data on 80 sub-components of the retail
prices index are available, the chart shows the relationship between the standard
deviation of those relative prices and the inflation rate in each month. At low
inflation rates, say up to 4% a year, it appears that it is the absolute value of changes
in relative prices that is linked to the inflation rate. This would be the case, as in
Britain recently, where changes in relative prices, whether up or down, were largely
responsible for short-term fluctuations in the inflation rate around a relatively stable
long run level. Variability in relative prices might lead inflation to be either above or
below the inflation target, but not systematically in one direction or the other.
Increases in house prices move the inflation rate up and falls in oil prices move it
down. In both cases, an increase in the variability of relative prices leads to
movements of inflation away from the target, but not in a systematic direction. But at
higher rates of inflation (or deflation) the deviation of inflation from zero is positively
correlated with the variability of relative prices. Hence, outside a range close to price
stability, the higher the inflation rate, the greater is the variability of relative prices.

So inflation makes it more difficult for firms and households to work out whether the
prices of the products they buy and sell have changed relative to other goods, or
whether there has been a change in the overall price level. Such confusion can lead
firms to produce, at least temporarily, the wrong level of output. And if many firms
make these mistakes at the same time then the result is an unnecessary fluctuation in
aggregate output.

6

Another decision affected by uncertainty about prices is investment. Many
investments are specific to a particular model or product, and so they become sunk
costs. For such irreversible investments it may pay to wait before investing since time
will resolve some of the uncertainty. A Premiership football team may decide to
postpone the construction of a new stadium until their survival in the League is
assured. Or a car manufacturer may postpone a decision about opening a new plant to
see if a rise in demand is temporary or appears likely to last. And that uncertainty
could stem from a difficulty in disentangling relative from absolute prices. In the
language of finance, there is an option value to waiting when there is uncertainty
about the returns on an irreversible investment.

So a project must offer a rate of return sufficient not only to cover the cost of
financing of the project, but also the option value to waiting. That may explain why
surveys of firms show that their hurdle rates of return are often well in excess of the
cost of either equity or debt finance. For example a CBI survey last year found that
the average real hurdle rate for UK firms was 11.3% – down from rates of around
15% in surveys conducted in 1994 – but still well above the cost of financial capital.
If uncertainty about inflation creates an option value to waiting, then it will reduce
investment. And there is growing empirical evidence that inflation is a key
explanatory variable for cross-country differences in investment to output ratios. 5

(ii)

Redistribution of wealth between debtors and creditors.

Unexpected changes in the price level – the standard of value used to define contracts
– produce arbitrary redistributions of wealth. As Keynes wrote in his powerful
advocacy of price stability in A Tract on Monetary Reform, “We leave saving to the
private investor. We leave the responsibility for setting production to the business
man. These arrangements have great advantages. But they cannot work properly if
the money, which they assume as a stable measuring-rod, is undependable.
Unemployment, the precarious life of the worker, the disappointment of expectation,
the sudden loss of savings, the profiteer – all proceed, in large measure, from the
instability of the standard of value”.

7

Or, as Lenin remarked, the best way to destroy capitalism is to debauch the currency.
It is arguable as to whether it is high inflation or serious deflation which results in the
greater economic damage. In Europe in the 1920s hyperinflation undermined
economic and social arrangements, as it has done more recently in Latin America.
But deflation has proved just as unpopular as inflation. In 274 A.D. the Roman
Emperor Aurelian tried to restore the integrity of the coinage which had been
adulterated by workmen in the Mint. Aurelian exchanged good money for bad, and
ordered the destruction of accounts drawn up in the devalued currency. In the long
run the operation restored the value of money. But in the short run it caused hardship.
Gibbon, in his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, observed that “a temporary
grievance of such a nature can scarcely excite and support a serious civil war”.
Unfortunately, taking a different and more Keynesian view that in the long run we are
all dead, the population at the time rose in insurrection. Many of them found that they
were dead in the short run as well, with seven thousand soldiers and countless
civilians perishing during the suppression of the uprising.

So let us consider the costs of wealth redistributions arising from unanticipated
deflation. Such redistributions can lower aggregate demand. Why? Since it is
difficult either to borrow or insure against uncertain future employment and earnings
opportunities, current assets act as a buffer stock to make it possible to smooth
consumption in the face of shocks to future prospects. When net worth is small it is
risky to run down the buffer stock even further, and so the marginal propensity to
spend out of wealth is much higher for households with low net worth than for
families whose assets comfortably exceed their liabilities. If significant numbers of
debtors have little net worth – recent first-time house-buyers with high debt-to-value
ratios are a prime example – then an unanticipated deflation could cause a sharp fall
in aggregate consumption spending.

Such effects can be amplified if spending – consumption or investment – depends on
the value of the assets that are used as collateral for loans. A fall in prices can
produce a vicious circle in which the initial fall in demand lowers asset prices,
reducing the value of collateral, which in turn leads borrowers to repay debt,

8

exacerbating the original decline in aggregate demand. This “debt deflation” was first
formulated clearly by Irving Fisher in the 1930s, and has recently been revived in a
more sophisticated form by Nobu Kiyotaki and John Moore, here at the London
School of Economics.

Because deflations are, fortunately, few and far between, there is a lack of hard
empirical evidence on the quantitative significance of debt deflation. In 1993, I
argued that the depth of the recession in the UK and the US in the early 1990s was the
result of debt deflation. Consumption fell more sharply than would have been
expected given movements in incomes and interest rates, reflecting an unexpected fall
in inflation and asset prices. The effects on consumption of negative equity in
housing were particularly severe.

The experience of Japan may add to our knowledge in this area, although, as shown in
Chart 6, despite a stagnant economy over the past decade, deflation of consumer
prices has not been especially large. And I am confident that all central banks will do
their best to prevent the sample size of countries suffering from serious deflation from
increasing.

(iii) Aversion to long-term contracts and excessive resources devoted to hedging
inflation risks.

As we have seen, high inflation goes hand in hand with greater uncertainty about
future inflation. Inflation is, therefore, associated with a positive risk premium to
compensate investors for that uncertainty. The longer the time horizon, the greater
the risk premium is likely to be. That discourages long-term contracts and interest
rates in such contracts will often depend upon future spot interest rates. Floating-rate
mortgages are a good example. With a floating-rate mortgage the borrower is
exposed to the risk of sharp fluctuations in the proportion of income that is devoted to
debt service, as many households in Britain still remember from the late 1980s when
interest rates doubled to 15%. Fixed-rate mortgages eliminate that risk, but at the cost
of introducing a new risk: the real value of the outstanding debt may change relative

9

to the value of the house. John Campbell and João Cocco (2002) have suggested that
a superior contract would be a fixed-rate mortgage where the principal was
index-linked. That would reduce both income and capital risk. For whatever reason
the market has not generated many private-sector index-linked contracts, despite the
encouragement of high inflation in the past. Perhaps that is because the risks are
generated not by some exogenous process, but by policy decisions. In any event,
price stability is a good alternative to indexation.

The move from a regime of high inflation to one of price stability can have
consequences which again are best illustrated by the housing market. A credible
move to inflation targeting can bring down inflation expectations relatively quickly,
even if with a lag. Chart 7 shows that inflation expectations, as measured by surveys,
fell steadily following the introduction of inflation targeting, and are now anchored on
the 2.5% target. But a move to low inflation has other consequences that may be less
easily understood. Price stability means lower nominal interest rates, and lower
mortgage interest payments. It may also mean lower real interest rates if the inflation
risk premium falls. But the fall in nominal rates is likely to be much larger than the
fall in real rates. The lower mortgage payment largely reflects a rise in the effective
duration of the loan because inflation no longer erodes the real value of the debt as
quickly as before. In a low inflation world, nominal incomes rise more slowly than
before and the real burden of servicing the debt persists. It may take longer for
households to work out the impact of low inflation on real interest rates than to realise
that the rate of increase of prices of everyday purchases has fallen. Learning takes
time.

One possible consequence of a slow adjustment to low inflation is that households
may mistake too much of the reduction in nominal interest rates for a permanent fall
in the real rate. As a result, asset prices are bid up to levels that prove unsustainable
when learning finally occurs – and at the LSE you know that in time we do learn.
How far this theoretical argument applies to the British housing market at present is
difficult to say, but it demonstrates the risks from current house price to earnings
ratios that are close to the peaks reached in the late 1980s.

10

So much for the costs of unanticipated inflation. What are the costs of anticipated
inflation? Time permits me to comment only briefly on the four costs of anticipated
inflation noted by Lord Kingsdown.

(i)

Distortions to cash balances

Money – notes and coin – may no longer, as Sally Bowles claimed, make the world
go round, but, even in a world of plastic, it oils the wheels of transactions. Cash still
accounts for a large number of transactions, albeit a smaller fraction of the value of all
transactions. The opportunity cost of holding cash is the interest rate on deposits.
Inflation raises nominal interest rates and hence this cost. So agents economise on
their real money balances, and incur additional costs in the form of more frequent
trips to the cash dispenser – the so-called ‘shoe-leather costs’ of inflation. The
traditional view was that these costs could be measured by the area under the money
demand curve. Such estimates were typically small, and left researchers wondering if
the costs of inflation were really all that important. But high inflation rates can affect
more than just money demand. If agents economise on money balances, transactions
costs may rise in markets for goods, labour and assets. As argued by Hahn (1965) and
more recently articulated by Wallace (2001), many monetary models contain hidden
inconsistencies in the sense that they ignore the credit or trade frictions – in particular,
imperfect monitoring and enforceability – that give to money an essential role in the
first place. To assess the welfare implications of inflation we need a theoretical
framework that takes seriously the role of money in all these transactions. I have
discussed elsewhere (King, 2001) the potential importance of money in reducing the
transactions costs of firms by reducing liquidity premia in a wide range of financial
markets. There is much to learn here.

11

(ii)

Incomplete indexation of the tax system

A second cost of anticipated inflation is the added inefficiencies that arise when an
already distortionary tax system is incompletely indexed. Martin Feldstein (1999) has
edited a major study of the costs of incomplete indexation which includes a detailed
analysis of the tax distortions to saving, consumption and investment in several major
countries, and to which the Bank of England contributed. The benefit of reducing
inflation in an already low inflation environment is estimated to be lower in the UK
than in some other countries because some parts of the tax system are indexed.
Nevertheless, the authors estimate that a reduction in inflation by 2 percentage points
would bring an annual benefit equivalent to 0.2% of GDP. That may sound small, but
it is a large absolute number. Against that, the end of mortgage interest deductibility
will have lowered the impact.
(iii)

Front-end loading of debt burdens

A third distortion is that of front-loading of the real debt burden when debt contracts
are fixed in nominal terms. Inflation reduces the amount that households borrow
because it raises the cost of servicing the loan in the early years. In this way decisions
on consumption and investment may be distorted.
(iv)

Costs of changing price lists

The costs of changing price lists and catalogues – so-called menu costs – are generally
agreed to be of little direct consequence. But they may produce a degree of nominal
rigidity in wages and prices which takes on greater significance. Inflation now causes
relative price variability as not all firms are able to change their prices at the same
time. The cost of greater relative price variability was discussed above, and continues
to be an active field of research. Recent work at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (2002)
shows that when inflation is higher, there is a larger dispersion in the inflation rates
faced by individual households. This finding points strongly to the role of nominal
rigidities in contributing to relative price dispersion.

12

Taken together, the verdict of economics, history and common sense is that inflation
and deflation are costly. It is clear that very high inflation – in extreme cases
hyperinflation – can lead to a breakdown of the economy. There is now a
considerable body of empirical evidence that inflation and output growth are
negatively correlated in high-inflation countries. For inflation rates in single figures,
the impact of inflation on growth is less clear. But in a study of 133 market
economies over the past 50 years, Stanley Fischer and his co-authors (2002)
concluded that “the old idea that in some sense inflation may be good for growth or is
perhaps an inevitable part of the growth process should remain buried in the cemetery
of harmful policy ideas”.
4. Price stability: what does it mean in practice?

So there is a strong case for price stability. But what does price stability mean in
practice? Recall that the definitions of price stability offered by Alan Greenspan and
Alan Blinder are rather general in nature and make no reference to particular indexes
of prices or precise numbers for inflation. There are good reasons for this. The prices
of the goods that I buy may rise at a different rate from the goods that you buy.
Relative prices are always changing. And the basket of goods and services that you
buy today is very different from the basket you could or would have bought fifty or a
hundred years ago. The official retail price index now includes computers and cable
TV, but no longer bowler hats or the price of admission to cricket matches.
Measurement problems mean that there is no unique way to calculate inflation.

Information on prices of individual commodities in the past can be found in Harrods
catalogues which were published from the mid-1890s until 1930, catalogues for the
Army and Navy Stores from 1872 to 1940, and the advertising records for Selfridges
which go back to 1909. To illustrate the problems of measuring inflation, I shall draw
largely on historic price material kindly provided by Harrods – mainly the Catalogues,
Harrods News, and Harrods Food News. No records were published after 1970, so
we have supplemented the historical data by our own researches. And I am very
grateful to the young Bank of England economist who was apprehended in the Food

13

Hall, suspected of comparing prices for a competitor who was opening a store across
the road.

The richness of this information can be seen from the size of the Catalogue for 1907 –
weighing over six pounds and containing 1375 pages. In those days the telegraphic
address of Harrods was “Everything, London”. The Internet has nothing on Harrods
in 1907 when a telephone service with real people answering was available to take
orders right through the night which were despatched early the next day with free
local delivery (as far as Windsor) and by mail elsewhere.

According to the catalogues, a record player in Harrods cost £11 in 1910
(approximately £627 in today’s money). That would have bought you a hand-cranked
machine that provided low-quality sound. Today, you could buy a record player for
as little as £39 on the Internet, and at Harrods a better quality model for £250. How
much have record-players increased in price? Ignoring quality changes, the price rose
by a factor of 3.5 (that is, £39/£11). But ignoring the vast quality improvements
would surely overstate this increase – a quality change bias. So how do we quantify
the increase in the quality of today’s record player relative to the one in 1910?
Statistically, there are a number of ways of dealing with this issue: one is to determine
the price as a function of characteristics that do not change over time. The prime
example of such hedonic pricing techniques in use today is for pricing computers,
where the quality characteristics – performance in terms of speed and memory – can
be fairly accurately measured. But hedonic pricing is not the only way to deal with
this measurement issue, and recent research suggests that these techniques may
overstate the extent to which quality has improved.
Is a record player still the relevant product, since record players today are only used
by a small group of enthusiasts of – now outdated – vinyl records? Perhaps a
computer or CD (or DVD or MP3) player is the relevant product today. From about
£34 you can buy a CD player on the Internet today. This is a much more
sophisticated piece of equipment than even today’s record player, and its features are
impossible to compare to those of a 1910 record player. If we ignore the invention
and marketing of new products, we introduce a new product bias.

14

To illustrate the quality change and the new product bias, imagine that we go
shopping in Harrods both today and in 1910. Suppose that we are given £350 to
spend – the same amount in both years. In 1910 you could have bought a vacuum
cleaner, a record player, an iron, a camera, and a telephone. The vacuum cleaner
would have spread as much dust as it removed, the record player would have been
hand-cranked and the iron would need to be filled with coal. The camera would have
been bulky and awkward to set up, and the telephone would have been largely silent
because so few people owned one. Today you can buy a similar bundle of goods for
the same total outlay, but all would be of vastly superior quality. So for durable
goods it is not clear that the cost of living has increased at all.
But if we buy food, however, the results are very different. Unlike appliances, many
of the food items in 1910 are unchanged today – McVitie’s digestive biscuits, Quaker
oats, Rose’s Lime Juice, Bournville cocoa, Frank Cooper’s Oxford marmalade,
Marmite, Heinz baked beans and Colman’s mustard are only some of the familiar
items for which precise comparisons over the years are possible. In 1910 you could
have fed yourself on 10p a day by eating Marmite on Hovis toast for breakfast; eggs,
bacon and toast for lunch; Heinz beans on toast for dinner; with a pint of milk to
drink. The same menu, consisting of exactly the same brand products, would cost
£4.80 today. The food basket has increased in price by a factor of 48.
A vacuum cleaner, if you wanted one in 1910, cost £229. That is more than 6 years
worth of food based on the menu used in the previous example. A vacuum cleaner
was an item of such luxury that owners would invite their friends round to ‘Hoover
parties’ to show off their prized possession. Over the years, the price of food
increased in nominal terms by a factor of 48, but the price of vacuum cleaners stayed
roughly the same. Today you can still buy a vacuum cleaner for £229. But that is
only 47 days of food shopping, rather than 6 years. As vacuum cleaners became
cheaper relative to food, people bought more of them – ignoring such change would
introduce a substitution bias. If there is any degree of substitutability between
products, then rational consumers would have taken account of such changes in
relative prices, and the weight of this particular good in the consumption bundle may
have changed. The overall result of the substitution is that the expenditure share of

15

electrical appliances 6 has not changed much, at least not in the past 50 years. If we
ignored the fact that vacuum cleaners were a rare luxury item in 1910 and applied
today’s quantities to calculate the 1910 consumption basket, we would greatly
understate the increase in the average cost of living.
And, of course, Harrods today is not exactly the typical place to go shopping – there
was not much talk in 1910 of suburban shopping centres, or of Internet shopping.
Ignoring developments in retail practice introduces an outlet bias. Had the bias
remained constant over the years, this would have been less of an issue for measuring
retail price inflation, but it clearly has not.
Quality change bias, new product bias, substitution bias and outlet bias – these are
some of the issues that the Boskin Commission discussed in their report on measuring
inflation in the United States. 7 The finding of the report, which generated wide
national and international interest, was that the US CPI might have overstated changes
in the cost of living by between 0.8 and 1.6 percentage points per year. The examples
I have given show how difficult it is to measure changes in the price level over time.
Precision is not to be had. According to the official retail prices index, the general
level of retail prices rose by a factor of 52 between 1910 and 2002. But changes in
the nature of the goods and services available, and the nature of retail selling, make
such comparisons treacherous.
Does this matter for price stability? Probably not. The Greenspan-Blinder definitions
of price stability suggest that we know price stability when we see it, or rather, when
we stop hearing about inflation. There is nothing mystical about the RPIX measure of
inflation, nor the figure of 2.5%. But it is important to have a precise numerical target
which is easy to understand in order to provide an anchor for inflation expectations
and to which the MPC can be held accountable.

5. Monetary policy over the next decade : what are the challenges?

Although inflation targeting has delivered many of the benefits from low inflation that
were promised ten years ago, there remain real challenges for monetary policy over

16

the next decade. Two questions have been prominent recently. First, is inflation
targeting enough? Second, is deflation, not inflation, the main threat at present?

Is inflation targeting enough? Do rapid increases in asset prices pose a threat to
stability, even though inflation targeting has delivered steady growth with low
inflation? Some commentators have suggested that monetary policy target asset
prices in addition to inflation. 8 But which asset prices, and what would that mean for
interest rates? House prices have been rising rapidly, and as a ratio to average
earnings have reached the previous peak in the late 1980s. That might suggest that
interest rates should have been higher. Sterling has for six years now been around
30% higher against the euro (or its predecessors) than before, the trade deficit has
grown and the profitability of manufacturing has fallen by two-thirds. That might
suggest that interest rates should have been lower. Equity prices rose by 120%
between 1995 and 2000, before falling 40% subsequently. Presumably that would
have implied first higher and then lower interest rates. What this means is that asset
prices cannot sensibly be viewed in isolation, but only in the context of the economy
as a whole. I believe that, although there are justifiable concerns about recent
movements in asset prices, the policy dilemma can be analysed within the framework
of inflation targeting that we have in the UK.

No honest person actually knows the “equilibrium” level of asset prices. They are
dominated by expectations of the prices that other investors will pay for those assets
in future. The relevant uncertainties can rarely be quantified by observing the
frequencies of events in the past. And the response of asset prices to changes in
monetary policy is also unpredictable. So targeting asset prices directly is virtually
impossible. But changes in asset prices can have a major impact on levels of
spending and the MPC devotes considerable time to the question of how such changes
should affect policy.

The immediate question is whether changes in asset prices have led to an imbalance
within the economy that poses the risk of a large negative demand shock at some
point in the future. I believe the answer is yes; but how big is that risk is extremely
difficult to judge, and so the appropriate policy response is far from clear. Beneath

17

the surface of overall stability in the UK economy lies a remarkable imbalance
between a buoyant consumer and housing sector, on the one hand, and weak external
demand, on the other. As a summary statistic of this imbalance, Table 4 shows that in
the United Kingdom the growth of real domestic demand exceeded the growth of
output by no less than 7½% over the five years to 2002 Q1, more than over any five
year period in the 1980s and more than in any other major country during the recent
past. Even the optimistic Mr Micawber would realise that this cannot continue
indefinitely. How then, and over what timescale, will these imbalances unwind?

Three possibilities deserve consideration. First, the rapid growth in household
consumption – averaging over 4% for the last five years – may reflect an adjustment
to higher real disposable incomes. Consumption growth would then slow naturally as
spending and debt reach their new levels. The imbalance between domestic demand
and output would unwind as steadily as it built up, with no reason to fear a sudden
correction. For this to occur the source of higher disposable incomes must be
permanent. In part the increase in recent years has resulted from the improved terms
of trade – 7% up on five years ago – which raise real national income for any given
level of output. The main threat to the persistence of that improvement is the
possibility of a fall in sterling that may be a necessary part of the rebalancing of the
UK economy. It is very hard to assess the risk of that over any given time horizon.
So far the path of consumer spending is not inconsistent with this benign outcome.

The second possibility is that the level of debt taken out by households – the
debt-to-income ratio is now at an all-time high – makes households sensitive to any
adverse future shock to their employment or income prospects. In that event the risk
is of a sharper adjustment of consumption to the shock than might otherwise have
occurred. Monetary policy would respond, but a large negative demand shock might
result in an undershoot of the inflation target for some considerable time.

The third possibility I touched on earlier. Households may adjust more quickly to the
implications of a low inflation world for the prices of goods and services than for
nominal interest rates or the future growth of nominal incomes. A mistaken
underestimate of real interest rates or overestimate of nominal income growth may

18

raise borrowing, spending and asset prices temporarily. Eventually households learn
and consumption adjusts, again possibly sharply.

The policy dilemma is that by allowing consumption and demand to grow rapidly
there is a risk that there will be a sharp correction of demand later. The essence of the
argument is well put by Borio and Lowe who, in a BIS Working Paper, argued that,
“lowering rates or providing ample liquidity when problems materialise, but not
raising them as imbalances build up, can be rather insidious in the longer run. They
promote a form of moral hazard that can sow the seeds of instability and of costly
fluctuations in the real economy”. In practice it is difficult to know whether an
“imbalance” does contain the seed of a future negative demand shock on a scale that
would leave inflation below the target for some considerable time, or whether it will
unwind of its own accord.

The fact that growing imbalances might cause sharp deviations of inflation from
target at some point in the future, raises the possibility of a trade off between
deviations of inflation from target over the next year or so and deviations of inflation
from target further ahead. That, I believe, is the right way to think about the
challenge to monetary policy posed by asset price movements. Although there are no
simple answers I hope I have shown that inflation targeting is enough, provided that
one thinks carefully about the horizon over which policy can hope to affect inflation.

The second challenge for monetary policy over the next decade is the possibility of
deflation. That prices are now rising at the slowest rate for decades is, of course, a
positive achievement of which the Bank is proud. But is the real threat now
deflation? It is important to recognise that falling prices of manufactured goods is not
the same as general deflation. In fact price stability, in the sense of an inflation rate
overall of around 2½% a year, is likely to mean that the prices of manufactured goods
will, on average, not rise at all. Faster productivity growth in manufacturing than in
services, averaging around 2% over the last twenty years, means that the prices of
services will rise faster than those of manufactured goods. And the rise in sterling
over the past five years increased the difference between inflation rates in the two
sectors.

19

Table 5 shows the inflation rates for goods and services in the major economies.
Positive rates of inflation for services, which account for around half of consumer
spending, show deflation in most of the world economy is still some way off. In all
countries over the past decade the gap between goods and services price inflation
reflects productivity differences. That gap has widened somewhat in recent years as
increasing competition from new producers has driven down prices of tradable goods.
But the striking feature of the table is the extent to which the difference has increased
to no less than 5.7 percentage points in the UK, much more than in the US where in
turn the gap is larger than elsewhere. Exchange rate movements are largely
responsible for these differences. The extent to which services inflation has risen
relative to goods inflation is another manifestation of the imbalance within the UK
economy.

Deflation – in the sense of a sustained fall in the aggregate price level – can be found
among the G7 economies only in Japan, where the consumer price level has been
falling almost continuously for four years and by a cumulative total of 4%.
Elsewhere, deflation is remote.

All of this serves to remind us that, with a single instrument, monetary policy cannot
ensure that inflation is at target and output on trend all of the time. To suppose
otherwise is to believe in the “myth of the straight line”, as Nigel Lawson described it.
Monetary policy can reduce, but not eliminate, fluctuations in output. Cycles in real
activity sometimes reflect behaviour outside the influence of monetary policy. As
Lawson (1994) put it, “I find it wholly unconvincing to believe that the credit cycle is
caused simply by mistakes in monetary policy. Of course, such mistakes can
exacerbate the cycle; but the cycle would be there without them. There is no way in
which the monetary authorities can fine-tune bank lending, any more than they can
fine-tune expectations”.

That is why the framework introduced in 1997 explicitly recognises that the MPC
would not attempt to bring inflation back to the target immediately following a large
shock. As a result inflation might deviate from the 2.5% target by more than one

20

percentage point. That would require the Governor to write an open letter to the
Chancellor. Ed Balls explained in his Oxford lecture in 2001, “Some have assumed it
[the requirement to write an open letter] exists for the Chancellor to discipline the
MPC if inflation goes outside the target range. In fact the opposite is true. In the face
of a supply-shock, such as a big jump in the oil price, which pushed inflation way off
target, the MPC could only get inflation back to 2.5 per cent quickly through a
draconian interest rate response - at the expense of stability, growth and jobs. Any
sensible monetary policymaker would want a more measured and stability-oriented
strategy to get inflation back to target. And it is the Open Letter system which both
allows that more sensible approach to be explained by the MPC and allows the
Chancellor publicly to endorse it.” That applies not just to a supply shock, but also to
a demand shock that might follow a large movement in asset prices.

Both challenges to policy in the future have one aspect in common: they make us
think carefully about the consequences of current policy for inflation well into the
future. Asset prices raise the question of how far one should err on the side of caution
while imbalances are building up. Deflation makes us aware of the risk that the zero
lower bound on interest rates might bind in the future. They imply that while, in
normal circumstances, monetary policy should focus on meeting the inflation target
eighteen months or two years ahead, in practise it may be necessary to look even
further ahead about the consequences of present actions. But that should not deflect
monetary policy from its task of keeping inflation on track to meet the target in the
medium term, in other words achieving price stability.

6. Conclusions

When Lord Kingsdown addressed the LSE ten years ago, he said that departure from
the Exchange Rate Mechanism, offered an opportunity – “An opportunity to demolish
the image of the United Kingdom as a second-rate inflation-prone economy”. I
believe that opportunity was taken. Today the UK has low and stable inflation. And
that has not come at the expense of either output or employment. Britain has now
experienced 41 successive quarters of positive economic growth. And unemployment
in this country is lower than in any other G7 country. This greater stability is no

21

accident. It is the product of a commitment to price stability as reflected in an
institutional design encompassing a clear inflation target and a transparent and
accountable process for reaching decisions on interest rates embodied in the Monetary
Policy Committee.

At the beginning of my lecture I referred to the frescoes of Good and Bad
Government by Lorenzetti. If today you go to the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena to see
these wonderful paintings in the Sala della Pace, which I translate as the Room of
Stability, you will see the results of allowing daylight to fall on the walls. Yes,
greater transparency – more daylight – has damaged the paintings. But if you look
carefully, you will see that whereas daylight has caused no harm to the paintings of
Good Government, it has indeed damaged Bad Government on the opposite wall.
Even today, Lorenzetti’s frescoes tell us about the benefits of transparency and the
importance of careful institutional design.

Five years ago I delivered, again in this room, a lecture on the inflation target five
years on. I argued that the new requirement on the Governor to write an open letter to
the Chancellor whenever inflation deviated from target by more than one percentage
point would provide ample opportunity for the Bank to restore the lost art of letterwriting. No letter has so far been required. But given Alan Blinder’s definition of
price stability – when ordinary people stop talking about inflation and converse
instead about more important matters – I hope that the MPC, by remaining focussed
on its task of meeting the inflation target, will be more successful in restoring the
equally lost art of good conversation. In that way the inflation generation will give
way to a new generation able to devote its energies to the wider economic and social
policies from which our attention has so often been diverted by the need to control
inflation.

The lesson of the past ten years is that it is stability – price stability and the broader
economic stability which it generates – that is the platform for the deeper satisfaction
portrayed so well in Lorenzetti’s frescoes.

End Notes

The conclusion reflects statistical tests including first-order auto correlations of consumer price
inflation over ten-year rolling windows, and estimated spectral densities for inflation from a random
coefficient AR (4) and GARCH (1,1) model. The only periods in which persistence was lower than in
the 1990s was in the early 1930s and early 1960s.

If index-linked contracts were widely used the relevant real rate would be the index-linked rate. And
if the risk premium were determined largely in an integrated world capital market without frictions then
again the real rate would be the riskless index-linked rate.
3

Most of the evidence on the link between inflation and stability comes from the United States where
the greater stability of output is evident over the past two decades. A number of recent studies have
concluded that at least part of the explanation for greater stability can be attributed to better monetary
policy, for example Taylor (1998)
4

The behaviour of monetary policy in the United Kingdom after 1992 more closely resembles a
“Taylor Rule” that has been shown to fit data in the United States than was the case before 1992. See
the work of Ed Nelson of the Bank of England (Nelson 2000)
