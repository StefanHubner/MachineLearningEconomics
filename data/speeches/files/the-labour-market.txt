This talk focusses on the labour market, and in particular the limited response of wage growth to falling
unemployment. At first glance, the labour market now looks very tight. The jobless rate is down to 4.8%,
slightly below both the 2000-07 average and the MPC’s estimate of the equilibrium rate, which are about 5%

1

(see figure 1). The jobless rate has only been below current levels for a few months in the last
2

40 years . The short-term jobless rate is the lowest since data began in 1992. The number of job vacancies
is around a record high, and the ratio of unemployment to vacancies matches the 2005 low (see figure 2).

However, even with relatively low unemployment, average weekly earnings growth remains modest, at 2-3%
3

YoY . Unit labour cost growth is perhaps still slightly below the pace consistent with the inflation target over
4

time . There is little sign of significantly higher pay growth for 2017 (see figure 3).

The labour market models used by most forecasters, which presumably are based on past behaviour, have
not done well in explaining and forecasting the modest trend in pay growth. In recent years, pay growth has
5

repeatedly undershot consensus expectations, OECD forecasts and BoE forecasts despite falling
unemployment (see figures 4 and 5). Indeed, the UK has seen the biggest average undershoot in pay growth
of any country compared to the OECD’s forecasts in recent years (see figure 6).

Most forecasts have looked for the relation between unemployment and pay growth to return to something
like that seen before the 2008-09 recession, whereas in practice this relation seems to have shifted
6

downwards again (see figure 7) .

Of course, all forecasts are fallible. But such repeated and widespread forecast errors are interesting
because they hint that the underlying behavior of wage growth has changed. This is also evident in figure 8,
showing the gap between average pay growth in 2014-16 and projections based on simple wage Phillips
curves (i.e. regression of pay growth on unemployment) fitted over 2000-13 across OECD countries – with a
marked undershoot in the UK.

I suspect the subdued trend in wage growth in part reflects structural changes which these models may not
fully capture, including greater labour market flexibility and insecurity, extra labour supply, increased
under-employment, broader educational attainment, and changes to the tax and benefit system. These
changes probably imply greater downward pressure on pay growth for any particular jobless rate than
previously.

Both are actually 5.1%.
The low of the last 40 years was 4.7%, seen for a few months in 2004-05.

Note that weakness in pay growth is not a quirk of the AWE data, but evident also in guides such as the LFS, average hourly pay,
ASHE surveys, BoE Agents and the CIPD pay surveys. BoE research previously identified the effect of composition changes in
dampening pay growth (see Broadbent 2015), but this effect has faded recently.
4
Over the period 1997-2015, CPI inflation averaged 2.0% YoY, unit wage cost growth averaged 2.2% YoY and ULC growth averaged
2.4% YoY. Unit wage cost growth was 1.2% YoY in Q3. ULC growth was 2.3% YoY, which may reflect the sharp YoY rise in employers’
social contributions. If we assume that ULC growth in Q4-2016 matches the Q3 pace, average ULC growth in 2016 would be 2.0% YoY.
5
See Haldane (2015).

The BoE’s November IR forecasts repeat this pattern, projecting that two years ahead the jobless rate will be around 5½% and pay
growth around 4% YoY.

The BoE’s 5% estimate of the equilibrium jobless rate is based on a mix of empirical observation from the
pre-crisis period (the last time the economy had a near-zero output gap), time series analysis and a labour
market search and matching framework. This search and matching framework consists of a Beveridge Curve
(BC), which shows combinations of unemployment and vacancies for a particular level of search efficiency,
and a job-creation curve (JCC), which shows V-U combinations of equal profit for firms. In this model, higher
unemployment makes it more attractive to create vacancies and hire people as the match rate is higher, but
there are diminishing returns to creating vacancies as the jobless rate falls and the labour market becomes
‘congested’. The intersection of these lines is the equilibrium jobless rate. The gap between the actual
jobless rate and this equilibrium is used as an input to a standard wage Phillips curve model (with some role
for inflation expectations).

There was an apparent rightward drift in the Beveridge curve in 2013-14 (see figure 10), which suggested
7

reduced labour market matching efficiency . Recent data bring us roughly back to the 2002-05 trends.
Hence, assuming the job creation curve has not shifted, one could infer that the natural jobless rate is about
the same as the pre-crisis period.

The search and matching model has advantages of solid theoretical underpinnings. However, as noted, the
forecasts for pay growth derived from this natural rate estimate have not been very accurate in recent years.

One issue is that the derived natural jobless rate has a sizeable margin of error, especially because
parameters of the job creation curve are poorly observed. This also means that these models are quite slow
to reflect structural changes. And, as Peter Diamond argues, the US Beveridge curve often shifts out as
unemployment starts to fall, but these shifts have not been useful predictors of the jobless rate that the
8

economy attained at the end of subsequent expansions . In addition, the search and matching model aims to
measure a long-run equilibrium. At any particular time, this may not necessarily be the same thing as the
NAIRU, defined loosely as the jobless rate consistent with on-target inflation once shocks from the exchange
9

rate etc have worked through . For example, increased labour supply might shift the NAIRU for a period,
especially if new entrants behave differently to the existing pool of workers.

Moreover, the search and matching model assumes that the level of vacancies is a consistent guide to
labour demand over time. This may not be valid. In particular, costs of recruitment advertising have plunged
with the shift from ads in newspapers and magazines to internet-based ads. Average advertising spend per
job vacancy is down by 53% in real terms over the last five years and by 80% over 10 years

10

(see figures 11

and 12). For firms who advertise vacancies through their own web site, it is almost costless to keep an ad
running for an extra month or two.

See Bova et al (2016).
See Diamond and Sahin (2014).

The BoE has also at times used a more time-varying short-term equilibrium jobless rate.

The collapse in the cost of recruitment advertising may lift labour demand a little, because total hiring costs
are slightly lower than before. But, the more important effect may be to increase the number of recorded
vacancies and reduce recruitment intensity, as firms become more “picky” in hiring and more likely to engage
in what search theorists call speculative ‘fishing’. That is, firms may post more job vacancies and for longer,
with more specialised requirements, with little expectation or intention they will all be filled. Research in the
11

US has identified this effect , and suggests that it increases when the economy weakens or credit
availability worsens. Hence, we may see less observed cyclical variation in official vacancy data and greater
cyclicality in recruitment intensity.

The same may be happening here, with a marked recent discrepancy between the vacancy data (which
indicate very high labour demand) and surveys of firms’ hiring intentions (which suggest labour demand is
around average), see figure 13. Likewise, although the CBI reports the greatest skilled labour shortages in
manufacturing since 1989, business surveys overall do not suggest the labour market is the tightest in recent
decades (see figure 14).

Short-term changes in the number of vacancies probably remain a useful signal of whether labour demand is
rising or falling. But a given level of vacancies may not signal as much labour demand or labour shortages as
10 years ago, with lower and more variable recruitment intensity. This effect might well produce an apparent
rightward shift in the Beveridge curve even if there has been no underlying change in this relation. Or, it
could disguise an underlying leftward shift in the Beveridge curve. It probably would also affect the job
creation curve. All this would increase the likelihood of misleading signals from labour market slack
measures based on the search and matching model.

Two widely-cited explanations for recent weakness in pay are low productivity growth and low headline
inflation. If these views are valid, then pay growth might well be about to recover markedly, either because of
higher inflation or higher productivity growth, even if the jobless rate is stable or rising.

However, while these factors probably have played a role, I doubt they are the whole story. There is a close
long-run link between real pay growth and productivity growth. But the causality in recent years has probably
gone both ways: low productivity growth has capped pay, but low pay growth (due to other factors) probably
has lifted labour demand and lowered productivity growth, via the substitution of labour for capital and
expansion of labour-intensive sectors with low average levels of pay and productivity (see figure 15).
Hence the UK has ended up with low pay growth, higher employment and low productivity growth.

By international standards, the recent slowdown in UK pay growth is far more exceptional than the
productivity slowdown (see figure 16). UK productivity fell sharply in the 2008-09 crisis. But, productivity
12

growth over 2011-16 (averaging 0.6% YoY) has been similar to the OECD average . The slowdown versus

the precrisis pace (down by 1.2pp from 1.8% YoY in 1997-07) also is similar to the OECD average (down by
1.0pp). However, the slowdown in pay growth in the UK over 2011-16 (down by 3.5 pp versus 1997-07) was
roughly twice the OECD average (1.8pp). Hence, unit labour cost growth slowed much more in the UK than
the OECD average and indeed more than any other G7 country.

Likewise, at a sectoral level, there is little link between weakness in productivity and pay growth (see figure
17). To be sure, with the UK's flexible labour markets, one would not expect sectoral differences in
productivity growth to be fully reflected in sectoral variations in pay. But if the productivity slowdown is the
main driver of weakness in pay, one might expect at least some link at a sectoral level, given that people
13

cannot always move seamlessly between sectors .

Moreover, unit labour cost growth (which roughly equals pay growth less productivity growth) has also
undershot the BoE’s internal forecasts in recent years. By contrast, if weakness in pay just reflected a
surprise productivity slowdown, one would expect higher ULC growth, because wage growth would probably
not respond one-for-one to weaker productivity unless unemployment rises.

Regarding the theory that low inflation caused low pay growth, I note that pay growth has undershot
forecasts when inflation has been relatively high (e.g. 2011-12) and low (2014-16). Moreover, it is hard to
find statistical evidence of a consistent link from headline inflation to pay in recent years. Figure 18 shows
various regressions that seek to explain private sector pay growth (ex bonuses), using unemployment,
14

productivity growth, and inflation (or inflation expectations) . In the equations fitted over 2001-2010, inflation
or inflation expectations do not really play much role, and are jointly insignificant in statistical terms. And the
equations fitted over 2001-2010 all project that pay growth now “should” be above 3% YoY. Since 2011,
15

inflation and expectations are jointly significant, but expectations outperform the headline inflation rate .

If we use both headline inflation and inflation expectations in the same equation, the coefficients on headline
inflation are either insignificant in statistical terms or negative (ie implying that lower inflation, without a shift
in inflation expectations, would lift pay growth). To be sure, results may differ slightly over other sub periods.
But that would reinforce the point that there does not seem to have been a stable link from headline inflation
16

to pay. The effect of the jobless rate appears more pronounced in recent years .

I do not suggest that recent low inflation rates had zero bearing on pay growth. But, their effect is probably
embodied in inflation expectations and - since these are already included in forecasts - does not explain
surprise shortfalls in pay. The CIPD pay survey suggests that firms’ ability (or inability) to pay more matters
17

far more than headline inflation in determining pay growth . And, as with productivity, the causation may run
13

Especially given that labour market churn – the movement of people from one job to another -- has been relatively low in recent years.
Also with lagged pay growth.
15
Expectations also outperform the current and lagged perceived inflation rate, as measured by the BoE survey.

both ways; lack of wage pressure may have contributed to low inflation, particular when weak wages have
come as a surprise to policymakers.

The structural changes in the labour market are too recent to allow a definitive estimate of the new
equilibrium jobless rate. In any case, it may still be changing. Some of these factors might lower the natural
jobless rate, but perhaps not easily fit into a search and matching model. Others may not permanently alter
the natural unemployment rate, but may reduce wage growth for a given jobless rate for a sustained period
of time - perhaps well beyond our forecast horizon.

Flexibility and insecurity. In the last five years, the numbers of people that are self-employed has risen by
18

14%, the number of agency workers is up by about 30% , and the number of businesses registered in the
UK is up by 40%. There has been also been the expansion of zero hours contracts and the “gig economy”.

19

Among people in work, the proportion that are full-time employees (ie not self-employed, not part-time, not in
a temporary job) remains well below pre-recession levels (see figure 19). Of course, some people may prefer
flexible work structures or seek to reinvent their career through self-employment. But, given that on average
20

these less secure forms of work are also less well-paid , the expansion of contingent work probably also
reflects the erosion of secure and well-paid jobs from technological gains and greater emphasis on cost
control.

Another factor lifting job insecurity is that the costs of losing a job appear to have risen significantly. For
example, there is tentative evidence that wage scarring – that is, the adverse effects on someone’s future
pay levels from a spell of unemployment

21

– has increased, at least initially. Using LFS micro data, figure 20

shows the disparity in wage levels between people in work now but unemployed a year earlier, compared to
those that were also in work a year earlier, controlling for other factors such as age, education, gender,
tenure, industry, occupation etc. This wage gap was falling up to 2010 but has risen to about 11% on
average in 2015-16 (and over 12% in 2016). Moreover, the number of people receiving jobless benefits is
now only about half the number unemployed, with far tougher application of work search tests since 2010. By
22

contrast, 20 years ago, the number receiving jobless benefits was equal to 80% of the number out of work .
Reduced job security and the greater financial cost of unemployment may reduce workers’ bargaining power
and create higher risk aversion – making people more likely to settle for modest or no wage growth and
continued employment, rather than push for higher wage growth if that comes with risks of job losses. In
addition, the tightening in criteria for benefit eligibility probably has also increased the pressure on the
unemployed to get into work.

Under-employment. The rise in part-time work also has been associated with more widespread underemployment. The ONS reports that 8.4% of people in work would like (and are available) to work more
23

hours, including part-time and full-time workers and those willing to work more hours in an extra job . Unlike
the unemployment rate, under-employment remains somewhat above the pre-crisis average (6.7% over
2002-07, see figure 21). Moreover, one should also consider under-employment in terms of skills: the ONS
reports that 47% of recent graduates are in non-graduate jobs, up from 37% in 2001.

Education attainment. Education attainment has risen sharply in recent years. Since 2000, the share of the
population aged 25-74 years with tertiary (ie university level) education is up from 21% to 38%, while the
24

share who did not complete secondary education is down from 27% to 20% (see figure 22) . The share of
25

people with tertiary education - and the rise since 2000 - are among the highest of any EU country . Given
that the tertiary education rate among people aged 25-44 years exceeds 45%, the overall tertiary education
rate will rise further in coming years due to cohort effects, even if the numbers entering tertiary education
stabilises.

This matters because on average, people with tertiary education are far less likely to be unemployed than
26

people with low educational attainment . Over 1992-2015, the jobless rate among people with tertiary
education in the UK on average was 5-6 pp below that for people who did not finish secondary education
(see figure 23). The graduate pay premium has shrunk in recent years, but the gap in jobless rates has been
27

roughly stable . Moreover, jobless rates among the less educated are far more cyclical than among those
28

with better education .

The marked broadening in education attainment over recent years should therefore imply a lower structural
jobless rate, as the overall population becomes more adaptable to change and employable across a range of
areas. As a rough estimate of this effect, if we freeze the jobless rate by education attainment at the 2000
average, and track forward the change in educational attainment since then, the jobless rate now “should” be
about 1 percentage point below the 2000 level (see figure 24).

Rising participation rate. The bound between workforce participation and inactivity is proving much more
flexible than previously. The participation rate among people aged 16-64 years is up from 76.6% in 2011 to

23

I use here the share of people who are under-employed. The ONS also reports figures for the number of extra hours that people
would like to work, but there is evidence that people overstate the number of desired extra hours, see Weale (2014).
24
Among people in the workforce, the tertiary education rate is up from 26% in 2000 to 42% now, the share without secondary
education is down from 28% to 16%.
25
Only Luxemburg and Ireland have seen a bigger rise in the share of the population with tertiary education. Among EU countries, only
Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Cyprus and Ireland have a higher share of the 25-74 year age population with tertiary education. The
average for both the EU and Euro Area is 28%, compared to the UK level of 38%. Data from Eurostat. In terms of absolute numbers, the
UK has more graduates than any other EU country.
26
The gap is particularly marked for long-term unemployment. Roughly 70% of people that have been unemployed for more than 12
months do not have A-levels (or equivalents) or further education (source ONS).
27
In Q1-Q3 2016, the jobless rate for people without secondary education was 8.5%, while that for people with tertiary education was
3.0%. The gap, of 5.5pp, matches the average for 2000-07.
28
Using annual Eurostat data, the jobless rate among people with tertiary education varied from 2.2% to 4.9% over 1992-2015, while
that for people without secondary education varied from 6.0% to 12.5%.

78.3%, close to a record high, while participation among people aged 65-74 years is up from 14.4% to
29

17.1% . Hence, workforce growth has averaged 0.9% YoY from the start of 2011, far above the growth in
the working age population (0.2% YoY). In recent years, more people moved into work from inactivity than
from unemployment. This implies that potential labour supply exceeds the unemployed: it also includes
people currently outside the official workforce statistics but likely to join the workforce in coming quarters and
move directly into employment.

Various factors are lifting participation rates, including rising life expectancy and improved health, the rising
female retirement age, and technological gains that facilitate flexible work. The expansion of in-work tax
credits has greatly increased the rewards from being in work, even if low-paid, especially for people with
30

children . Increased educational attainment also is a factor, especially the drop in the numbers of people
who did not complete secondary education. Participation rates are much lower for this group (see figure 25),
and as the numbers in this category fall, participation rates naturally rise. This factor alone can account for
much of the observed rise in participation rates for the 20-64 year age group in recent years (see figure 26),
outweighing potential downward effects from population ageing.

The uptrend in participation may not be over. Participation rates exceed UK levels at most age groups in a
range of Northern European countries (see figure 27). The female retirement age is still rising and the
concept of a fixed retirement age (eg 65 years) no longer applies. Adverse effects from population ageing
are likely to continue to be balanced by the drop in the share of the adult population lacking secondary
education. Moreover, low annuity rates and the prospective erosion of real wages from currency-induced
inflation may pressure some people to work longer out of economic necessity.

Inward migration. Official data on inflows of foreign workers to the UK workforce are incomplete, but ONS
data suggest that people born outside the UK accounted for more than half of the growth in employment over
the last five years, and 95% of the last year’s employment growth (see figure 28).

Migration has complex effects on the labour market. Clearly, inflows expand labour supply, especially given
that foreign workers generally integrate very effectively into the UK labour market. Unlike most other EU
countries, foreign-born people in the UK have a similar jobless rate to UK-born people. But migration inflows
also boost labour demand. Availability of foreign workers probably encourages firms to expand and invest in
the UK. Increased employment boosts consumption and housing demand.

Academic research suggests that migration inflows have not reduced overall UK wage levels, but may have
31

depressed pay at the bottom end . However, most studies have focussed just on the change in pay growth,
29

Source: Eurostat. A higher average age in employment can also directly drag on wages (aside from augmenting labour supply)
through career life cycle effects. Evidence from the US suggests that wage growth tends to decline after the age of around 40 – a
finding robust to across educational attainment. See Rich et al (2016).

rather than the change in pay growth for a given jobless rate and in the context of demand-boosting effects
of migration.

Research by Bentolila suggests that increased migration inflows have helped shift the wage Phillips curve
32

down in Spain . I suspect the same has happened here. The attractions of working in the UK, which
generally has high wage levels and low unemployment by EU norms, means that labour supply has
expanded to meet demand with little upward pressure on pay. In particular, the greatest undershoots in pay
growth relative to the jobless rate in recent years have been in regions with high migration inflows
(e.g. London, South East, East England and East Midlands).

Prospects for inward migration to the UK in the next 2-3 years, especially from other EU countries, are
33

uncertain . The lower pound may discourage inflows, because it reduces UK pay levels in foreign currency
terms, but the UK's high employment rate will probably remain a strong "pull" factor.

Skill and regional mismatches. The high jobless rates of 20 and 30 years ago were exacerbated by the
collapse of employment in manufacturing and construction in some regions, whereas job growth was
concentrated in other sectors and regions. Such mismatches limited the extent to which high unemployment
dampened pay growth. This issue appears less acute now. For example, the standard deviation of sectoral
jobless rates

34

is at a record low (see figure 29). Similarly, recent job growth has been slightly stronger in
35

regions with higher jobless rates, the opposite of the pattern in 1995-2007 .
36

Regional disparities in income levels remain high . But there is also tentative evidence of increased internal
migration within the UK. For example, the numbers of people moving between local authority regions has
risen to record highs in the last two years (see figure 30). This may reflect greater mobility among
international migrants within the UK. Or it may be that, with lower home ownership rates, it is less costly for
people to move to another job.

Public sector pay. The squeeze on public sector pay and jobs may also have capped private sector pay, by
reducing competition for labour. However, it is hard to find a consistent effect over time. In recent years, pay
growth has not been particularly weak relative to the jobless rate in regions with a high share of public sector
37

jobs (e.g. Wales, NE England) .
38

Other factors may also be at work, for example, self-fulfilling lower expectations for wage growth .

I acknowledge that this is all quite uncertain and imprecise. I suspect that the equilibrium jobless rate has
fallen below 5%, but am unsure how far. Some of these factors could be consistent with a flatter
Phillips curve, but the fact that pay growth has stayed modest even with the jobless rate at 4.8% suggests
that the equilibrium is lower than previously as well.

If one were to simply extrapolate the wage Phillips curve of 2011-16 with stable inflation expectations, the
jobless rate would probably need to fall to 4% or lower to lift pay growth to 4% YoY. I do not suggest this is
39

the most likely outcome. The Phillips curve may indeed be curved rather than a straight line . Currencyinduced inflation might lift inflation expectations sharply. Availability of migrant workers might decline sharply
before and after Brexit. But it is also possible that Brexit-related uncertainties will reinforce other factors
dampening pay, and that labour supply will expand as higher inflation erodes household spending power.

My hunch is that underlying pay growth will probably stay comfortably below the 4% pre-crisis norm during
the next few years, unless the economy is strong enough to pull unemployment significantly lower and/or
long-term inflation expectations rise markedly. To be sure, with modest productivity growth, the pace of wage
growth consistent with the inflation target over time probably is lower than it used to be. But, even so, labour
cost growth in 2017 seems unlikely to pose major upside risks to the inflation target.

In my view, this has several implications for a monetary policymaker.

First, comparisons of the jobless rate with historic norms or natural rate estimates may not be a totally
reliable guide to labour market conditions at present. We should consider a range of indicators and
acknowledge that estimates of the equilibrium jobless rate are somewhat fuzzy, and may change in ways
that cannot be fully anticipated or understood at the time.

Second, there may now be more cyclical variation than before in insecure employment, under-employment,
participation and productivity, and less cyclical variation in unemployment. Slack may change even if the
jobless rate is little changed.

Third, monetary policy should not be set in a way that seeks to rule out sub-5% unemployment over time,
unless we see clear evidence of markedly higher labour cost growth and/or long-term inflation expectations,
or the tradeoff versus currency-driven inflation is much worse than expected. The economy might be able to
run with lower unemployment than previously, consistent with the inflation target. But I stress that our target
is for inflation not unemployment.

Fourth, a lower equilibrium jobless rate would not necessarily mean that it is appropriate to loosen policy
further. Nor would it rule out tightening. Sterling’s recent depreciation will probably lift inflation above target

39

this year, and economic growth recently has been stronger than expected. Rather than the rise in
unemployment forecast in the November Inflation Report, it seems quite possible to me that the jobless rate
will stay below 5% this year. In considering the appropriate policy, I will be taking account of all of this, rather
than just one part.

Also, I want to stress the uncertainties. I am conscious of historical episodes whereby overly optimistic
