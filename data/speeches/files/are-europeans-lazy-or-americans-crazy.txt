Patterns of Market Work: Some Facts
In the light of the provocative title of this Conference, it may be a good
idea to rehearse some of the relevant facts. Before plunging in to the
data, it is important to recognise that these have been built up from a
variety of sources which may not be wholly suited to making crosscountry comparisons. They do, however, give us a flavour of the story.
In Table 1, we present a measure of the total market labour input per
person of working age. We also see how this divides into employment
per person and hours per employed individual. Looking first at the total
measure, we see huge variations across countries. Some broad groupings
stand out.

The Anglo-Saxon countries (excluding Ireland) have the

highest labour input and Japan slots into this grouping. The Scandinavian
countries (excluding Norway) are the next highest group and Switzerland
fits into this group. The “Big Three” of Continental Europe, France,
Germany and Italy, are right at the bottom. The Anglo-Saxon countries
provide around 39% more market work than the Big Three and the
Scandinavian group around 27% more. So the Scandinavians are much
closer to the Anglo-Saxons than to the Big Three. This immediately
suggests that looking at these matters in a “Europe versus US” framework
is a hopeless strategy.
Looking at the hours/employment rate breakdown, the Scandinavian
countries have the highest employment rates and the Anglo-Saxon
countries have the highest numbers of hours worked per year by those in
work. The Big Three have low levels of both, although the Netherlands
and Norway stand out as having the lowest hours worked, in the former
case because of the large numbers of part-timers as analysed in the

2

Netherlands chapter (Kramarz et al., 2006, Chapter 5). In Table 2 we see
how the annual hours data break down into hours per week and weeks per
year. The latter tend to exhibit more variation than the former. For
example, Americans tend to work over 14 per cent more weeks per year
than the French and Germans but only 8 per cent more hours per week.
Overall, weekly hours worked by those in work contribute less than one
quarter of the total difference in market labour input per capita between
the United States and France and Germany.
It is interesting to compare these data with the time-use data reported in
Burda et al. (2006). In Table 3, we see that the market work numbers
generated by the time-use data are larger than those in Table 1, mainly
because the time-use data do not fully capture vacations and holidays.
Nevertheless, the correlation between the two measures of market work is
0.76 and the correlation between the measure of market work in Table 1
and all work (market work plus home work) in Table 3 is 0.55. So the
two data sources are telling similar stories.
The History of Work Patterns
In Table 4, we present the history of total market labour input per capita.
Back in the early 1970s, the Anglo-Saxon countries, the Scandinavian
countries and two of the Big Three, France and Germany, all had the
same level of market labour input per capita at around 24 hours per week.
By contrast, total labour input in Italy and the Netherlands was far lower
at around 19 hours per week. Since then, labour input in the AngloSaxon countries has hardly changed, in the Scandinavian countries it has
fallen a little (except Norway) and in France and Germany the fall has
been substantial.

3

Looking just at the employment/population rate, we see in Table 5 that
the employment rate in Scandinavia has always been high because of
high participation rates among women. In France and Germany, in the
early 1970s, employment rates were comparable with the Anglo-Saxon
economies and they were low in Italy and the Netherlands because of low
female participation. Since then, there have been some changes but the
overall picture is one of rising female participation along with some fall
in the participation of men.
Turning to hours per year, we see in Table 6 that there have been some
significant changes in the last three decades. In the early 1970s, hours
per year were much the same in all the countries although the numbers in
Norway and Sweden were lower than average despite their extremely
buoyant labour markets. Since then, the falls in hours per year have been
very different in the various countries.

France, Germany, and the

Netherlands have seen falls of around 500 hours, Norway and Japan falls
of around 400 hours and Ireland and the UK declines of around 300
hours. By contrast, the falls in Sweden, Australia, Canada and the US
have only been around 100 to 150 hours.
Some Important Features of these Changes1
Prime-age men (25-54)
In this group, non-employment has risen almost everywhere, mainly due
to increasing inactivity. Today, those countries with prime-age male
inactivity above 9% are Finland, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Australia and
the US. This is a somewhat curious collection because these are nearly
all countries with high levels of total labour input per capita. By contrast,
for example, the European Union average level of prime-age male
inactivity is 7.6%. A significant proportion of the increase in inactivity

4

since the early 1970s may be attributed to the operation of the disability
benefit system. So we find that among inactive prime-age men in the
high level countries, a good proportion are categorised as long-term sick
or disabled.
Older men (55-64)
In the early 1970s, inactivity rates in this group were nearly all below
25%. Italy was the outstanding exception at over 40% because even then,
the official retirement age was only 60. By 2004, inactivity rates in this
group were nearly all above 25%. But there are big variations. In the Big
Three and Belgium, the inactivity rate exceeds 50%.

In most of

Scandinavia (except Finland) it remains around 25% with the AngloSaxon countries around 32%. The big changes were basically down to
early retirement incentives typically introduced on the back of the worksharing arguments discussed extensively in Kramarz et al. (2006).
Prime-age women (25-54)
Inactivity rates among prime-age women have generally come down
since the early 1970s, in some cases hugely, such as in the Netherlands.
It still remains fairly high (over 30%) in Spain and Italy. And this is not
because women there are looking after children.

Indeed, these two

countries now have the lowest fertility rates in the OECD and, more
generally, fertility rates and female participation rates are now positively
correlated across European countries.

As well as tax structures and

employment protection rules, barriers to, and preferences about, part-time
work are important here. For example, in Finland and Spain, few women
work part-time and most of these would rather not. By contrast, in the
Netherlands most women work part-time and the majority of these do not
want a full-time job.

5

Vacations and holidays
One of the interesting features of the data on annual working hours is that
almost all countries except the US have legal minima on paid annual
vacations in excess of four weeks. With national holidays adding an
extra two weeks or so, most workers in the OECD get at least six weeks
holiday per year. In the US, the average is a little below four weeks.
Furthermore, these legal minima have risen steadily since the early 1970s,
at different rates in different countries.
Sickness absence and maternity leave
There are significant variations in the extent of annual weeks of shortterm sickness absence and maternity leave, much of which can be
explained by variations in the benefit systems across countries as well as
the behaviour of general practitioners. The benefit systems tend to be
most generous in Scandinavia and least generous in the Anglo-Saxon
countries.
Overall hours per year
As well as the negative effects of taxes and employment protection rules,
a significant factor which is strongly positively related to annual hours is
the extent of earnings dispersion. Bowles and Park (2005) argue that this
arises because of the “Veblen effect”. Based on the ideas in Veblen
(1934), the argument is that households consume goods not only for their
own sake but to impress the neighbours. With more dispersed earnings,
additional work effort is required to make the appropriate impression. By
contrast, Bell and Freeman (2001) argue that increased earnings
dispersion induces longer hours because it raises the incentives to work
harder in order to move up the earnings ranking.

6

Some Overall Conclusions
Some of the stories which have been proposed to explain variations in
market work are as follows. The first, which is frequently used to explain
cross-country variations in labour input, is based on labour taxes, a recent
example being Prescott (2004). The evidence we possess indicates that
taxes cannot be the whole story. The tax story is inconsistent with the
small tax effects on labour inputs generated by microeconometric studies
(Alesina et al. 2005) and those generated by cross-country studies
(Nickell, 2003).
A second story is in the same spirit as the tax story but adds in all the
other elements of the social security system including early retirement
benefits, sickness and disability benefits, unemployment benefits and so
on. These are certainly good at explaining the changes in some aspects of
the labour input, notably inactivity among men, both prime age and old,
as well as a part of the changes in unemployment and female
participation. But shifts in annual working hours are a major part of the
story and here, while labour taxes have a significant impact, they explain
only little of the overall picture (see Faggio and Nickell, 2006).
A third story is that favoured by Alesina et al. (2005) who argue that the
nexus of strong unions, generous welfare benefits and social democratic
governments imply both high taxes and direct pressure towards less work.
This latter is partly driven by work-sharing in response to adverse shocks
and partly by the not unreasonable belief that long holidays are a good
thing for workers, hence laws governing minimum levels of paid annual
leave. In practice, all developed OECD countries bar the US have such
laws, even those such as New Zealand and the UK where unionisation

7

has collapsed. However, as we have seen in the relevant chapters of
Kramarz et al. (2006), the work-sharing story applies clearly to Germany
and particularly France, where incentives to reduce labour supply have
consistently been applied in response to increases in unemployment,
culminating in the imposition of the 35-hour week in France in the late
1990s.
However, as the relevant chapter in Kramarz et al. (2006) makes clear, it
is hard to see how the work-sharing story applies to Sweden which has
stronger unions, more generous welfare benefits, higher taxes and more
social democratic governments than either France or Germany. Yet it has
one of the highest employment rates in the OECD and only a small fall in
labour input since the early 1970s. Thus, overall labour input in Sweden
was 3% below that in France and Germany (average) in 1970 and 26%
above in 2004. Both Italy and the Netherlands also had only small falls
in labour input from 1973 to 2004, but for very different reasons. In both
countries, labour input in 1973 was exceptionally low. In Italy this was
because female participation was very low, with an employment rate of
around 30%. Furthermore, the retirement age was 60 for men and 55 for
women, at least five years younger than in any other European country.
For example, it was 67 for both men and women in Denmark and
Sweden. So it is no surprise that in 1973 and, indeed, even in the 1960s,
Italy had the lowest employment rate in the OECD. And it still does.
Add in only a modest fall in annual hours and we find only a small fall in
overall labour input. There is no strong element of work-sharing here.
Indeed, the Italian labour market model, with minimal welfare benefits
and very strong employment protection, places a great deal of weight on
the position of the male head of household, which is not to be undermined
either by the presence of a high earning wife or by the loss of a job. Thus

8

the unemployment rate of husbands at 2% was, in 1992, among the
lowest in the OECD (see OECD, 1994, Table 1.19). While the labour
input in the Netherlands was also exceptionally low in 1973, the
subsequent history is completely different.

The employment rate of

women in 1973 was extraordinarily low in the Netherlands at 28.6% but
by 2004 it had risen to 65.7%. As a consequence the overall employment
rate had risen by 17 percentage points, by far the largest increase in the
OECD. But the majority of women in employment in the Netherlands
work part-time, so average annual hours fell dramatically. The overall
consequence of this was that the total labour input had barely changed by
2004, although it has increased by around 20 per cent since the Wassenar
agreement of the early 1980s.
From all these different histories, it is clear that there is no simple story
which can explain what is going on. If we take groups of apparently
similar countries, even then we find considerable within group variations.
For example, in the “Anglo-Saxon” group, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, UK, US, all have a high level of labour input at present. Yet
while Australia and Canada continue to have a strong union presence and
Canadian labour taxes have risen significantly, their labour input has
risen whereas, in the UK, union membership has collapsed since the
1970s and labour taxes have not increased, yet labour input has fallen by
nearly 12% since 1973. Compared to this group, the Scandinavian group
(Denmark, Finland, Sweden) has, and always has had, very high
employment rates, very strong unions and very rapid increases in labour
taxes. Yet their labour inputs have not fallen rapidly and are only around
10 per cent lower than in the Anglo-Saxon group. By contrast, the major
countries of Continental Europe, France and Germany, where unions are
weaker and taxes have risen less rapidly, work-sharing strategies have

9

been embraced wholeheartedly and labour inputs have fallen dramatically
in the last thirty years.
The upshot of this is that there is no clear, simple story which will explain
the cross-country pattern of market labour inputs over the last forty years.
The incentives embedded in the tax and social security systems of the
different countries are clearly important and explain many features of the
pattern. But they are far from being the whole story. Trade unions, and
indeed the population at large, have embraced work-sharing strategies in
response to adverse shocks in France and Germany. This has helped to
drive down annual working hours by around 500 since the early 1970s.
This liking for work-sharing strategies is not, however, shared in the
more corporatist societies of Denmark, Sweden and Finland perhaps
because they have a different view of how the economy works (see SaintPaul, 2004). Here the tax/legal framework is used to enhance work/life
balance, with very high labour force participation and relatively stable
annual hours, which have fallen little over the last thirty years despite
numerous adverse shocks.
Broadly speaking, we can discern three groups of countries, AngloSaxon, France/Germany, Scandinavia where there is some sort of
coherent story to be told about their patterns of market labour input and
the role of taxes, benefits, unions and other labour market institutions.
But further countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, do not fit into
any of these three groups, and different explanations of their labour input
patterns are required. Overall, while it is plain that the tax/benefit system
and unions and other labour market institutions are important in
explaining labour input patterns across the OECD, other factors are

10

involved which are not easy to identify but lead to substantial differences
from one country to another.
