My first memories of Leeds are from a wet summer in 1958. I was ten years old, we
lived on the moors above Hebden Bridge, and my father took me to my first Test Match –
England against New Zealand at Headingley. It rained all day on both Thursday and
Friday, and, when play started in mid-afternoon on Saturday, on a drying wicket New
Zealand were bowled out by Laker and Lock for 67. So I became a slow bowler. I was
taught to bowl – slow left arm – at Old Town primary school by the headmaster, Alfred
Stephenson. During the morning break he would mark the wickets in chalk in the
playground, and draw a small circle exactly on a length. If we could pitch the ball within
that circle he would give us a farthing. As we improved, and the payout of farthings
increased, the morning break became shorter and shorter – my first lesson in economic
incentives, or what is known in the trade as “moral hazard”.

So let me move forward 50 years to the events of 2008, and describe the nature of the
financial crisis, the steps that governments and central banks have taken to deal with it,
and, most important, the implications of recent events for the UK and world economies.

Since August 2007, the industrialised world has been engulfed by financial turmoil. And,
following the failure of Lehman Brothers on 15 September, an extraordinary, almost
unimaginable, sequence of events began which culminated a week or so ago in the
announcements around the world of a recapitalisation of the banking system. It is
difficult to exaggerate the severity and importance of those events. Not since the
beginning of the First World War has our banking system been so close to collapse. In
the second half of September, companies and non-bank financial institutions accelerated
their withdrawal from even short-term funding of banks, and banks increasingly lost
confidence in the safety of lending to each other. Funding costs rose sharply and for
many institutions it was possible to borrow only overnight. Credit to the real economy
almost stopped flowing. In financial markets, confidence in others fell to a point where
investors sought refuge in government instruments such as US Treasury Bills, which at
one point yielded a negative return. Central banks around the world were providing
enormous amounts of liquidity to some institutions while at the same time taking large
deposits from others. Eventually, on 6 and 7 October even overnight funding started to

2

dry up. Radical action was necessary to ensure the survival of the banking system. And
on the morning of 8 October that action was taken when the Prime Minister and
Chancellor unveiled a UK plan for recapitalising the banking system on which the Bank,
FSA and Treasury had been working for a while.
Why was radical action necessary? When the financial turmoil began in August 2007,
markets for a number of financial instruments, including mortgage-backed securities,
dried up. Most observers expected this closure to be short-lived, and the predominant
view was that the crisis was one of (a lack of) liquidity. But, as time passed and markets
did not re-open, it became clear that the problem was deeper seated, and concerned the
solvency of the banking system and the sustainability of its funding model. Attempts to
deal with the problem by injections of liquidity from central banks led to temporary
alleviations of the symptoms, but, after an initial improvement, conditions would
deteriorate again.
The scale of central bank liquidity support during the crisis has been unprecedented, and
all central banks have increased the scale of their lending in broadly similar ways. The
UK taxpayer now has a larger claim on the assets of banks (in the form of collateral held
by the Bank of England) than the total equity value of UK banks. Massive injections of
central bank liquidity have played a vital role in staving off an imminent collapse of the
banking system. Such lending can tide a bank over while it is taking steps to remove the
cause of the concerns that generated a run or lack of confidence. But it can also serve to
conceal the severity of the underlying problems, and put off the inevitable day of
reckoning.
I hope it is now understood that the provision of central bank liquidity, while essential to
buy time, is not, and never could be, the solution to the banking crisis, nor to the
problems of individual banks. Central bank liquidity is sticking plaster, useful and
important, but not a substitute for proper treatment.
Just as a fever is itself only a symptom of an underlying condition, so the freezing of
interbank and money markets was the symptom of deeper structural problems in the
banking sector. So let me explain why a major recapitalisation of the banking system

3

was necessary, was the centrepiece of the UK plan (alongside a temporary guarantee of
some wholesale funding instruments and provision of central bank liquidity), and was in
turn followed by other European countries and the United States.

Securitised mortgages – that is collections of mortgages bundled together and sold as
securities, including the now infamous US sub-prime mortgages – had been marketed
during a period of rising house prices and low interest rates which had masked the
riskiness of the underlying loans. By securitising mortgages on such a scale, banks
transformed the liquidity of their lending book. They also financed it by short-term
wholesale borrowing. But in the light of rising defaults and falling house prices – first in
the United States and then elsewhere – investors reassessed the risks inherent in these
securities. Perceived as riskier, their values fell and demand for securitisations dwindled.
For the same reason, the value of banks’ mortgage books declined. Banks saw the value
of their assets fall while their liabilities remained unchanged. The effect was magnified
by the very high levels of borrowing relative to capital (or leverage) with which many
banks were operating, and the fact that banks had purchased significant quantities of
securitised and more complex financial instruments from each other. Not only were these
assets difficult to value, but the distribution of losses across the financial system was
uncertain. Banks’ share prices fell. Capital was squeezed.
Markets were sending a clear message to banks around the world: they did not have
enough capital. At the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington ten
days ago, the message was reinforced by our colleagues from Japan, Sweden and Finland,
who, with eloquence and not a little passion, reminded those present of their experience
in dealing with a systemic banking failure in the 1990s. Recapitalise and do it now was
the lesson. Recapitalisation requires a fiscal response, and that can be done only by
governments.
Confidence in the banking system had eroded as the weakness of the capital position
became more widely appreciated. But it took a crisis caused by the failure of Lehman
Brothers to trigger the coordinated government plan to recapitalise the system. It would
be a mistake, however, to think that had Lehman Brothers not failed, a crisis would have

4

been averted. The underlying cause of inadequate capital would eventually have
provoked a crisis of one kind or another somewhere else.
So where does this leave us? The recapitalisation plan is having a major impact on the
restoration of market confidence in banks. Perhaps the single most important diagnostic
statistic is the credit default swap premium – an indicator of market concerns about
solvency of banks. These premia have fallen markedly since the announcement of the UK
plan. From the close of business on 7 October to now the premia on the UK’s five largest
banks have more than halved. We are far from the end of the road back to stability, but
the plan to recapitalise our banking system, both here and abroad, will I believe come to
be seen as the moment in the banking crisis of the past year when we turned the corner.

As concerns about the viability of our banks recede, banks should regain the confidence
of the market as recipients of funding. There are already some signs of greater activity.
But the age of innocence – when banks lent to each other unsecured for three months or
longer at only a small premium to expected policy rates – will not quickly, if ever, return.
In itself that does not affect the ability of banks to fund lending, but confidence has been
badly shaken after the traumatic events of the past few weeks. New sources of funding
will develop only slowly, although the temporary government guarantees of new lending
to banks will help. So it will take time before the recapitalisation leads to a resumption of
normal levels of lending by the banking system to the real economy. And we cannot
assume that there will not be problems in other parts of the financial system and in some
emerging market economies to be overcome before the crisis can truly be described as
over.

With the plan for recapitalisation in place, the focus of attention has moved to the outlook
for the UK and world economies. Over the past month, the economic news has probably
been the worst in such a short period for a very considerable time. The most recent
activity indicators for the second of half of the year have fallen sharply. In the UK,
unemployment continues to rise and, over the past three months, has risen at the fastest
rate for seventeen years, albeit from a relatively low level. House prices declined by
about 5% in the third quarter and are 13% lower than a year ago. The recent weakness of
5

the housing market is likely to continue. And if the news on the domestic front were not
sufficiently discouraging, the rest of the world economy also appears to be slowing
rapidly.

Why has the outlook deteriorated so quickly? The banking crisis dealt a severe blow to
the availability of credit. Growth in secured lending to households fell to an annualised
rate of 1.9% in the three months to August, its lowest level in more than a decade. The
Bank of England’s survey of credit conditions suggests that the terms on which banks
provide credit to companies have tightened even further. And, on some estimates, the
supply of finance to the UK corporate sector has ground to a halt. This credit shock has
come on top of a fall in real disposable incomes resulting from the rise in energy and food
prices earlier in the year. So, taken together, the combination of a squeeze on real takehome pay and a decline in the availability of credit poses the risk of a sharp and
prolonged slowdown in domestic demand. Indeed, it now seems likely that the UK
economy is entering a recession.

At the same time, consumer price inflation, our target measure, has risen from around the
2% target at the beginning of the year to a worryingly high rate of 5.2% in September.
Oil and other commodity and food prices have all been rising very rapidly. In those
circumstances, it was sensible to allow those price changes to be absorbed by movements
in consumer prices. The alternative would have been an even sharper slowdown in the
economy. Central banks in other countries also find themselves in a similar position.
Over the past year or so, CPI inflation rose from 2.0% to 5.6% in the United States and
from 1.7% to 4.0% in the euro-area.

It is surely probable that the drama of the banking crisis, which is unprecedented in the
lifetime of almost all of us, will damage business and consumer confidence more
generally. But two pieces of good news should temper the gloom. First, the banking
system will be recapitalised and, in due course, the banking system will resume more
normal lending, although by normal I do not mean the conditions that prevailed prior to
August 2007. Second, oil prices have now fallen from a peak of $147 a barrel only three

6

months ago to around $70 today. And wholesale gas prices have now also started to
follow oil prices down. That will help to support the growth of real incomes as well as
bringing down inflation.

So, what should the Monetary Policy Committee do now? It must continue to set Bank
Rate in order to meet the 2% inflation target, not next month or the month after, but
further ahead when the impact of recent developments in both credit supply and world
commodity prices will have worked their way through the economy. This is the time not
to abandon but to reinforce our commitment to stability. The slowdown in demand, and
the recent falls in energy prices, will bring inflation back towards the target. The
Committee must balance the risk that a prolonged slowdown in domestic demand pulls
inflation materially below the target against the risk that today’s high inflation rate
becomes embedded in inflation expectations. During the past month, the balance of risks
to inflation in the medium term shifted decisively to the downside. And the MPC – in an
action co-ordinated with six other major central banks – cut Bank Rate by half a
percentage point to 4.5%.

Looking ahead, the outlook is obviously very uncertain – both for the world as well as
our own economy. The MPC cannot simply extrapolate the past into the future. The
prospects for oil and other commodity prices are difficult to assess. So too are the period
over which bank lending will return to normal and the extent of the damage to business
and consumer confidence. Moreover, the credit crunch affects not just demand but also
the supply potential of the economy, complicating the assessment of the inflationary
impact of changes in the level of demand. The associated shift of resources away from
those parts of the economy that have flourished in recent years towards other areas of
economic activity will moderate the increase in potential output while that adjustment is
taking place. The MPC must monitor carefully all the available evidence about fastchanging patterns of spending, supply and prices. It will act promptly to ensure that
inflation remains on track to meet our target.

7

The downturn in the economy will affect not just monetary policy but fiscal policy too.
That subject is for another occasion, but there is one point I do want to make tonight.
The cost of supporting the banking system will inevitably raise the level of national debt.
Managed properly, however, such a rise in national debt need not prove inflationary.
Indeed, within a reasonable period it should be possible for the Government to reduce its
stake in the banking system, for example by selling units in a Bank Reconstruction Fund,
and repay the additional debt that had been issued. That is one difference between past
increases in national debt in times of war and the increase now to pay for recapitalisation
of the banking system which involves the acquisition of an asset.

Let me take you back again to 1958. In the very first television interview given by a
Governor of the Bank of England, Cameron Cobbold explained national debt to Robin
Day on “Tell the People”, the highlight of ITN’s Sunday evening schedule fifty years
ago. Here is the exchange:

Cobbold:

The National Debt represents the sums of money which the Government
have over the years borrowed from the public, mainly in this country and,
to some extent, abroad. That is really the amount of expenditure which
they have failed over the period to cover by revenue.

Day:

Have we paid for World War II?

Cobbold:

No.

Day:

Have we paid for World War I?

Cobbold:

No.

Day:

Have we paid for the Battle of Waterloo?

Cobbold:

I don’t think you can exactly say that.

On this occasion, we should have little difficulty in evaluating when we have paid for the
recapitalisation. There are, though, questions about the source of the funding and the
level of borrowing by the country as a whole from overseas. For several years, the UK
banking sector has been relying extensively on external capital flows, principally shortterm wholesale funding, to finance its lending activities. Those external inflows have

8

fallen sharply – a mild form of the reversal of capital inflows experienced by a number of
emerging market economies in the 1990s. Unless they are replaced by other forms of
external finance, the adjustments in the trade deficit and exchange rate will need to be
larger and faster than would otherwise have occurred, implying a larger rise in domestic
saving and weaker domestic spending in the short run.

With the bank recapitalisation plan in place, we now face a long, slow haul to restore
lending to the real economy, and hence growth of our economy, to more normal
conditions. The past few weeks have been somewhat too exciting. The actions that were
taken were not designed to save the banks as such, but to protect the rest of the economy
from the banks. I hope banks will come to appreciate, just as the New Zealanders at
Headingley in 1958, the Yorkshire virtues of patience and sound defence when batting on
a sticky wicket. I have said many times that successful monetary policy would appear
rather boring. So let me extend an invitation to the banking industry to join me in
promoting the idea that a little more boredom would be no bad thing. The long march
back to boredom and stability starts tonight in Leeds.
