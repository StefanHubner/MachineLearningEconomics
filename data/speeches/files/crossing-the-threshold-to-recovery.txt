Introduction

I’m delighted to be in the East Midlands today to deliver my first speech as Governor of the Bank of England.
With leaders in retail, manufacturing, engineering, logistics, information services, biosciences and education,
Nottingham and the East Midlands are integral to the success of the UK economy. The businesses here will
make good on the promise of recovery in our economy. So I’m very pleased to have the opportunity to listen
to business people in this region. In my years in central banking, I have found that there is no substitute for
hearing directly from those who deliver economic growth.

What I hear from businesses here and elsewhere is that a renewed recovery is taking hold amid a rising tide
of optimism. The signs are that this recovery is broad based and set to continue. This is welcome and
should be encouraged.

Over the past five years, a pervasive sense of uncertainty has held the economy back. The British people
have been through the virtual collapse of the financial system, the worst recession in living memory, large job
losses, falls in real wages and a, at times harrowing, crisis in the euro area, our most important trading
partner.

Households have been worried about their savings, jobs, earning power and their homes; companies have
been concerned about the availability of credit, the health of their suppliers, the viability of their markets and
the prospects for their investments. Uncertainty has reduced confidence, dampened spending, and slowed
growth.

As a result the UK has endured its weakest recovery on record. Comparisons with other countries throw that
fact into sharper relief. Over the past five years Germany has grown by 2%, the US by 5%, Australia by 13%
and China by more than 50%. Meanwhile the UK economy still produces 3% less than it did five years ago.

The real cost of this poor performance is that around a million more people are unemployed than before the
recession. Capacity has lain idle in firms and opportunities have gone wanting for lack of finance and
confidence. It will take a period of robust growth to begin to reduce meaningfully this spare capacity in the
labour market and in companies.

The Bank of England’s task now is to secure the fledgling recovery, to allow it to develop into a period of
sustained and robust growth. We aim to get there in part by reducing the uncertainty that has held back
growth. And we are using our full suite of policy tools to help rebuild confidence so that we all can move
forward in a sustainable manner.

First, we are giving confidence that interest rates won’t go up until jobs, incomes and spending are
recovering at a sustainable pace. In particular, we will have to see the rate of unemployment, currently
7.8%, fall at least to a threshold of 7% before even beginning to consider whether to raise Bank Rate.

Second, we are building confidence in banks so they can serve the needs of the real economy by providing
credit to those who can put it to work. In particular, we have required banks to repair their balance sheets so
that their capital ratios at least reach a threshold of 7% by the turn of the year.

Crossing these two 7% thresholds is necessary to ensure that our economy can withstand the inevitable
bumps along the road to full recovery.

We must meet the thresholds in a disciplined way. We will ensure that we bring inflation down as the
recovery progresses. And we will use our considerable policy tools to prevent new vulnerabilities, whether in
the housing sector or financial sector, from arising during this critical transition period.

Today I want to say more about how the Bank will help bring the British economy over the threshold into a
sustainable recovery and what that means for you.

Guidance about monetary policy

Three weeks ago the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) did something it has never done before: we gave
clear, quantitative guidance about the future path of monetary policy. Specifically, we announced that we do
not intend to raise Bank Rate at least until the unemployment rate falls to 7%, provided there are no material
threats to either price or financial stability.1 All nine MPC members agreed to set monetary policy in future
according to this framework of forward guidance.

That does not mean Bank Rate will automatically rise when unemployment falls to 7%. Nor is 7% a target for
the unemployment rate – it should ultimately fall well below that level. Before the Great Recession, the UK’s
unemployment rate stood at just over 5%. The 7% threshold is instead a staging post along the road to
recovery. When unemployment reaches 7% the MPC will reassess the state of the economy and the
appropriate stance of monetary policy.

Our forward guidance provides you with certainty that interest rates will not rise too soon. Exactly how long
they stay low will depend on the progress of the recovery and in particular how quickly unemployment comes
down. What matters is that rates won’t go up until jobs and incomes are really growing. The knowledge that
interest rates will stay low until the recovery is well established should give greater confidence to households
to spend responsibly and businesses to invest wisely.

It may seem that unemployment doesn’t have far to fall, from the current 7.8% to the 7% threshold. The
MPC’s central view, though, is that this could take some time – for three reasons.

1

Until the unemployment threshold is reached, the MPC also intends not to reduce the stock of asset purchases financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves and, consistent with that, intends to reinvest the cashflows associated with all maturing gilts held in
the Asset Purchase Facility.

First, while the outlook for growth has improved considerably in recent months, growth prospects over the
next three years are solid not stellar. The MPC’s current forecast is for growth to average around 2½% per
year over the next three years, just below its historical average rate of 2¾%. That suggests spare capacity
will be used up only gradually.

Second, a great many jobs need to be created to bring unemployment down. A fall in unemployment from its
current level to 7% over three years would mean well over three quarters of a million new jobs created – and
given the shrinkage in the public sector, over a million new jobs in the private sector.

Third, a recovery in growth does not necessarily mean faster job creation and lower unemployment.

More than half of the increase in employment since the recession has been in part-time jobs. Many
part-timers would prefer to work full time. If the recovery were fuelled by involuntary part-time jobs becoming
full time, nearly half a million fewer new jobs would be created.2

Moreover, there is certainly scope for the economy to grow through an increase in output per hour worked
rather than new job creation. Productivity growth has been anaemic and – remarkably – the UK is no more
productive than it was back in 2005 – before Jake Bugg got his first guitar. The critical questions are how
much and how quickly productivity improves.

The MPC’s central view is that productivity growth is likely to pick up only slowly in the early phase of
recovery, but that there is potential for growth to accelerate as the recovery takes hold. The slow pickup in
productivity means unemployment could initially fall quite rapidly, but fall short of 7%.

Over the next three years productivity is expected to grow at around 1.8% per year, below its pre-crisis
trend3 of 2.2%. While even that modest productivity recovery is not assured, it is hardly an aggressive
forecast. It implies that productivity reaches its 2008 level only in 2015. And it means that productivity
doesn’t catch up any of its current 15% shortfall relative to its pre-crisis trend.

Were any productivity catch-up to happen, unemployment could take even longer than three years to reach
the threshold.

A rebound in productivity, if accompanied by higher output growth, would be no bad thing. It would boost the
incomes of those in employment and is an essential part of improving the UK’s competitiveness.

2

1.4 million part-time workers would prefer to be working full time, three quarters of a million more than before the financial crisis. If
those additional involuntary part-time workers switched to full time working, the extra hours worked would be equivalent to over 400,000
new jobs.

Moreover, in such a scenario, you would know to expect interest rates to stay lower for longer, encouraging
household spending and business investment. Our forward guidance is a stabiliser – securing the scale and
duration of recovery that is needed to bring unemployment down.

The prospect that interest rates might stay at their low level for longer will not be welcome for savers. I have
tremendous sympathy for them – after all they have done the right thing, set money aside, and now they are
earning returns that are substantially below what they would have expected. But raising interest rates now is
not the answer – instead what savers need is a stronger economy. That will mean higher asset prices, and
will allow interest rates to return to normal levels in a sustainable way. A strong economy is in all of our
interests, as it will deliver better job prospects for our friends, neighbours, children and grandchildren.

The last thing savers want is for the UK to follow Japan by raising interest rates before recovery is secured,
only to find that we are condemned to decades more of low interest rates and lost opportunities.

Our forward guidance is about setting the path of inflation to return to target

Let me reassure you that our mandate to deliver price stability has not changed. Our inflation target of 2%
was reconfirmed in our remit from the Chancellor in March. The MPC’s guidance is fully consistent with price
stability. I can also assure you of my personal commitment to price stability. I certainly have no hesitation in
raising interest rates when required – when I was Governor of the Bank of Canada, we raised interest rates
as the recovery there gathered pace.

But that was the appropriate policy for Canada at that time. The challenges in the UK today are different,
and policy must be tailored accordingly.

The Bank of England’s remit recognises that, at times, it is appropriate to bring inflation back to target more
slowly in order to avoid unnecessary volatility in output. With a depressed level of output and inflation above
target due to temporary factors rather than demand pressures, this is such a time. The MPC is charting the
right path back to its 2% inflation target.

CPI inflation is currently being pushed up by rises in utility prices and tuition fees that do not reflect the
underlying pressure of demand on supply, along with the effect of past increases in import prices.
Underlying domestic inflationary pressure is subdued, with wages growing at only around 1% per year.
Although there will be bumps in the road, inflation is set to fall back over the next two years. In these
circumstances it would not make sense to choke off the recovery by raising interest rates prematurely.
Given that ‘administered and regulated’ price increases will continue to push up on inflation over the next two
years, the MPC is prepared to bring inflation back to the target over two years or a little longer.

Rest assured, however, that we will bring inflation back to target – and at each point we will ensure that risks
to price stability are contained. Our forward guidance builds in important safeguards of price stability. If

there are any signs of underlying inflation pressures building such that it seems inflation 18-24 months ahead
will be 2.5% or more, or if medium term inflation expectations are no longer sufficiently well anchored, then
the guidance on interest rates no longer applies. These safeguards give ample flexibility to bring inflation
back to target at the appropriate pace, while ensuring that risks to price stability are contained.

Market reaction to forward guidance

Much has been made of the upward movements in market interest rates since our announcement of forward
guidance. Let me give you my perspective.

There has been a generalised upward move in long-term yields in advanced economies, including the UK,
over the past month. The main common driver is speculation that the US Federal Reserve will soon reduce
the pace of its asset purchases. That has – not surprisingly – affected yields in other countries because
safe, liquid sovereign bonds of the world’s largest economies are close substitutes for each other.

In the UK, these movements have been reinforced

Chart 1: Cumulative probability of unemployment

by growing expectations of recovery. As we

having fallen below the 7% threshold (a)

explained at the time of the forward guidance
announcement, a rise in the yields on long term
bonds is consistent with our commitment to price
stability and supporting the recovery.

Market interest rates at terms of 2-5 years have also
risen recently. The date at which the markets expect
the first increase in Bank Rate has moved in from the
end of 2015 to mid-2015. One possible explanation
is that markets think that unemployment will come
down to 7% more quickly than we do. Since the aim
of our policy is to secure recovery as quickly as
possible, that would be welcome. But policy is built
not on hope, but on expectation. And we estimate
there is only a 1 in 3 chance of unemployment

(a)

The swathe shows the probability that the unemployment rate
has fallen below 7% in each quarter, according to the MPC’s
August 2013 Inflation Report forecast. The 5 percentage points
width of the swathe reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about
the precise probability in any given quarter, but it should not be
interpreted as a confidence interval.

coming down that quickly (Chart 1).4

Furthermore, thinking unemployment will come down faster than we expect isn’t enough to believe interest
rates will rise soon. As I said earlier, the 7% threshold is a staging post to assess the economy. Nobody
should assume that it is a trigger for raising rates.
4

We are not alone in that belief – other major independent forecasters such as the OBR and NIESR share our view that unemployment
will be above 7% in 3 years’ time. The MPC’s assessment of the outlook for unemployment and likelihood of hitting the threshold is
described in the August Inflation Report, available on the Bank’s website at
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2013/ir1303.aspx.

Another possible explanation is that the increase in shorter-term yields, like the move in long yields, reflects
changing expectations of US monetary policy. But the US recovery is much further advanced than that in the
UK.

While much has been made of the special relationship between the US and UK, it is not so special that the
possibility of a reduction in the pace of additional stimulus in the US warrants a current reduction in the
degree of monetary stimulus in the UK.

Movements in longer-term market interest rates are certainly relevant, but what matters most to you is what
actually happens to Bank Rate, now and in the future. That is because the interest rates on 70% of loans to
households and more than 50% of loans to businesses are linked to Bank Rate.5

And it is the Bank of England that controls that rate. We do not intend even to consider raising it before
unemployment falls to 7%. When it does reach that point, we will control whether a rise is warranted, taking
into account the strength of the recovery and the outlook for inflation.

The upward move in market expectations of where Bank Rate will head in future could, at the margin, feed
into the effective financial conditions facing the real economy. The MPC will be watching those conditions
closely. If they tighten, and the recovery seems to be falling short of the strong growth we need, we will
consider carefully whether, and how best, to stimulate the recovery further. Our forward guidance was clear
that, although we would not reduce the stimulus until the recovery is secure, we would if necessary provide
more.

Crossing the threshold to a healthy banking system

Confidence that interest rates will stay low is a necessary step to securing the recovery, but it is not
sufficient. The UK also needs a fit and healthy financial sector. It plays a vital role in generating services
output in the UK, creating jobs and in exporting to the rest of the world.

To serve the needs of the wider economy by extending credit to where it is needed, banks must command
the confidence of their customers and investors. That is why a second element of the Bank of England’s
strategy is to ensure that banks reach a clear threshold of good health.

Some argue that the repair of banks’ balance sheets holds back economic recovery because it causes banks
to cut back their lending. The reality is the opposite: where capital has been rebuilt and balance sheets
repaired, banking systems and economies have prospered.

53% of the stock of bank loans to non-financial businesses pay a floating interest rate, and for an additional one third the interest rate
is fixed for one year or less.

US banks have added more to their capital base since the crisis and, as a result, have been able to provide
more credit to their economy than UK banks have to ours. In the past two years, UK banks have reduced
their lending to the real economy by 1%. In those same two years, US banks have increased their lending
by more than 8% (Chart 2).

Within Europe, the correlation between the market’s assessment of a bank’s capital base at the end of 2011
and that bank’s lending over the subsequent year is striking (Chart 3).

Without an adequate capital base, banks will be wary of lending and, if they do, will find themselves needing
to turn off the lending taps when the unexpected happens, as it inevitably does. Investors will lack the
confidence to fund banks cheaply, raising the cost of credit to the real economy, and most importantly, you
will lack the confidence that credit will be available if you need it.

That is why the Bank of England has established a threshold for the capital base of the major banks and
building societies after taking account of likely future losses, fines for past misconduct and prudent
calculations of risk. That threshold, a capital base of 7% of their risk-weighted assets and at least 3% of their
total assets, must be crossed if the system is to be able to support and sustain the recovery. Some of the
UK’s major banks had already crossed it, and over the summer we have made sure that the others put in
place plans to reach it. The plans do not involve cutting back lending to the real economy.

As a result of the Bank of England’s actions, we can relax other requirements to help with the flow of credit.
Balance sheet repair will give confidence to depositors and investors who provide funding to banks. With
that market funding assured, banks can safely hold fewer liquid assets, such as government bonds, that act
as a cushion to be sold in the event that investors withdraw their funding.

Accordingly, I can confirm today that, for major banks and building societies meeting the minimum 7% capital
threshold, the Bank of England will reduce the level of required liquid asset holdings. The effect will be to
lower total required holdings by £90 billion, once all eight major banks and building societies meet the capital
threshold.6 That will help to underpin the supply of credit, since every pound currently held in liquid assets is
a pound that could be lent to the real economy.

Taken together, our actions create not just a more resilient system, but also one more able to support and
sustain a recovery by serving the real economy.

Crossing the threshold of balance sheet repair is not the end-point. The 7% capital threshold, like the 7%
unemployment threshold, is only a staging post at which we assess our next steps. Beyond that our major
banks will need to strengthen their capital base further. For example, large international banks will be
subject to new internationally-agreed requirements for systemically-important firms. Other UK-focussed retail
banks will need to meet the requirements set by the Vickers commission for ‘ringfenced’ banks. Our task will
be to manage the transition from the threshold to the end point in a gradual way that supports continued
confidence in growth.

Using all the Bank of England’s tools to secure a sustainable recovery

A recovering banking sector, coupled with persistently low interest rates and new government programmes,
may lead to concern that the seeds are being sown for a new cycle in the housing market. The number of
mortgage approvals for house purchase is up by 20% on a year ago, while house prices have risen by 5%
over the same period – and by more than that in some parts of the country.

That must be kept in perspective, however. Mortgage approvals are currently running at only a little more
than half, and transactions a little more than two-thirds, of pre-crisis levels. Households’ debt servicing costs
relative to income are below their 20-year average, and houses cost the same relative to earnings as they
did in 2003.

Nevertheless, the Bank of England is acutely aware of the risk of unsustainable credit and house price
growth and will be monitoring it closely.
6

In June 2013 the Financial Policy Committee concluded that there was scope for banks to reduce their holdings of liquid assets in the
near term, and recommended a relaxation in liquidity requirements in order to strike the appropriate balance between achieving
resilience and reducing possible impediments to the supply of credit to the economy. That relaxation was subject both to banks meeting
the minimum capital threshold, and to additional firm-specific considerations. Today the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has
agreed with that recommendation, and is announcing how it will be implemented. The PRA will be making a more detailed statement
today and writing to individual firms in due course.

The important thing to recognise is that we now have tools other than interest rates that can be used to
contain risks in the property and financial sectors. These so-called macroprudential tools were not available
to us before the crisis and we are now fully prepared to deploy them if that were needed. The Bank of
England is now in a position, for example, to supervise lending to specific sectors more intensively, to make
recommendations to banks and building societies to restrict the terms on which new credit is provided, or
even to raise capital requirements on mortgage or other types of lending.

Having these in our toolkit – and if necessary using them – will help us to keep interest rates low to secure
recovery without creating risks that make that recovery ultimately unsustainable. If that is not enough, a final
safeguard is built into our new forward guidance framework. The Bank’s independent Financial Policy
Committee has the task of warning publicly if persistently low interest rates are leading to vulnerabilities that
cannot be contained by other means.

In short, we are providing the stimulus the economy needs, but in a disciplined way to secure price and
financial stability.
Conclusion

Let me finish by drawing the pieces of the jigsaw together.

Developments at home and abroad suggest that conditions are in place for growth to be sustained into the
medium-term – though at a pace that is likely to be measured rather than rapid.

Households have reduced their debt levels and are now spending out of income. The outlook for the world
economy and our major export markets is a bit better. The extreme risks in the euro area have been
substantially reduced. The global financial system is being repaired.

There will still be bumps in the road ahead. A few can be foreseen, others will surprise. Emerging market
economies – the engine of global growth in recent years – are under strain as capital flows back to
recovering advanced economies. A few less well-managed financial institutions still have a long journey
ahead to rebuild their balance sheets and are vulnerable to shocks until they do so. Progress in Europe will
remain uneven.

We cannot control all these events. Instead we are focussed on doing what we can to reduce uncertainty
and build resilience so that the recovery can be sustained despite the inevitable shocks ahead.

We are removing uncertainty with our guidance that interest rates will stay low at least until unemployment
has fallen. That will boost demand.

By repairing the balance sheets of banks we are putting them in a position to support the real economy. That
will promote investment.

And by standing ready to use the range of other tools at our disposal, we can help to avoid sowing the seeds
of the next crisis.

In these ways, the Bank of England is helping the British economy over the threshold and into strong,
sustainable and balanced recovery.

Thank you.
