It is an honour to be here to give the Ronald Tress lecture. Ronald Tress pushed the frontier in economics by
recognising the importance of data for the conduct of public policy. His vision was surely nurtured by his
remarkably broad scholarship, as well as his years of experience in the War Cabinet, where he served from
1941 until 1947. He painstakingly worked on the construction of disaggregated labour and industry statistics.
More than anyone, he would have recognised the critical role that technology could play in the process.
Indeed, as Master of Birkbeck, one of his many legacies was to bring in the first electronic computer to the
University of London.
In the spirit of linking data and policy, today I will talk about inflation, the key element in our policy remit. And
more specifically, I will focus on the disconnect in the data between the facts (what inflation has actually
been) and what households perceived it – or expected it – to be. What is behind this disconnect and what
should be done about it?
I would like to emphasise four points.


Since the Bank of England’s independence in 1997, CPI inflation has averaged 2%. (It was 2.0% in
May 2019, the latest reading.)



Households’ perceptions and expectations of inflation have averaged well above our target, with
huge dispersion across different demographic groups. Moreover, a significant fraction of people
simply do not know what inflation is or might be – a pattern that appears to be particularly prevalent
among households with lower income and education.



Higher inflation expectations in principle reduce the incentive to save for the future, increasing
current spending. It is less evident how not knowing what inflation is or might be affects individual
behaviour. While bridging the gap between reality and expectations may not have a material
macroeconomic impact, it could certainly improve the decision-making of uninformed households.
The challenge is not just one for central bank communications as some of the differences in
perceptions and expectations may relate to varying degrees of financial literacy.



The Bank of England has made significant efforts to improve its communications and educational
outreach. The MPC, for example, now publishes a visual summary of the Inflation Report, which
aims to be accessible to a broad audience. The Bank has revamped its website and aims to speak in
plain English as much as possible. And colleagues at the Bank have produced a set of lessons on
the economy and how it relates to the individual, called econoME, which is part of a broader effort to
raise economic and financial literacy. But there is certainly scope to do more, and for other
organisations, like colleges and universities to join the effort.

Reality: inflation in the recent past
Since the Bank of England’s independence in 1997, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been tasked
with achieving price stability, as defined by the government’s inflation target. The formation of the MPC was
a further evolution of the UK monetary policy framework, following the adoption of an explicit inflation target
in 1992. Since 2004, the target has been set as an inflation rate of 2%, measured by the 12-month increase
in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).1
Before the mid-1990s, inflation was anything but low and stable (Chart 1). The average RPIX inflation rate
from 1976 to 1992 was 8.5%, ranging between 3% and 24% (Table 1). Following independence and the
adoption of inflation targeting, the behaviour of inflation changed markedly. Since 1997, CPI inflation has
averaged 2% and inflation has stayed within a relatively narrow range around its target. Moreover, the
largest misses can be partly attributed to volatile components such as food and energy prices. ‘Core’ CPI
inflation, which excludes these components, has been even closer to 2% (Chart 2).

The timing of the reduction in inflation was not coincidental. The framework changes helped address two
related causes of the high and volatile inflation in the 1970s and 1980s. A clear remit to target inflation
addressed the so-called time inconsistency problem: at any point in time, the temptation to unexpectedly

overstimulate the economy, which once anticipated, leads to an inflationary bias.2 And delegating decisions
on interest rates to a committee (the MPC) in an independent central bank has helped insulate monetary
policy from political influences. Specifically, the risk that the electoral cycle leads politicians to push for extra
stimulus ahead of re-election, also creating a tendency towards volatile and above-target inflation.3
Both of these causes stem directly from the interaction between monetary policy and inflation expectations.
When people expect that monetary policy will always tend towards providing extra stimulus, they will also
expect inflation to increase in future. Higher expectations are likely to then feed into economic conditions
today. If those higher expectations are slow to change, they can make it more costly to reduce inflation.
Monetary policy may have to be tight for a long period of time, imposing significant costs in the form of lower
activity and higher unemployment, before people lower their expectations.
The role of inflation expectations
People’s expectations of future inflation are key influences on current inflation. As such, the MPC closely
monitors a range of measures of inflation expectations. Understanding the causes and consequences of
movements in those measures is of the utmost importance for policy decisions.
Indeed, a range of evidence supports the idea that the reduction in the level and volatility of inflation over the
past forty years has come about in large part due to central banks’ success in reducing inflation
expectations. Inflation expectations affect people’s decisions in several ways.4 In turn, these decisions
influence everything from the amount of spending in the economy to the wages and prices set by companies.
All of which directly or indirectly affect the current rate of inflation.
First, if households and companies expect prices to rise more quickly, they are likely to negotiate higher
wage increases, and companies are more likely to set higher prices for their goods and services. Second,
changes in inflation expectations in financial markets are likely to affect the nominal value of the exchange
rate, affecting import prices and CPI inflation.
For both of these influences, it is likely to be the inflation expectations of firms and financial markets that
matter more than those of households. Individual workers tend to have limited bargaining power in wage
negotiations, so household expectations often play little direct role in wage-setting decisions. Perhaps as a
result, many studies and discussions have tended to focus on the inflation expectations of companies,

Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). Monetary policy is also subject to another time inconsistency problem
– that of stabilisation bias (see Woodford, 2003, for a discussion). This bias arises if policymakers may stabilise real activity by too much
relative to inflation. If they could commit to stabilising real activity more slowly, then they would achieve better outcomes because
expectations of future inflation would change in a beneficial way. But such a promise would no longer be the best thing to do once the
future arrived – it would be time inconsistent.

professional forecasters and financial markets.5 This evidence, as well as a casual reading of the data,
generally suggests a good understanding of the inflation process and of how monetary policy behaves.6
But third, for household spending decisions, household inflation expectations are likely to matter more. For a
given level of interest rates, if households expect prices to rise more, that increases their incentive to spend
today rather than saving. In other words, higher inflation expectations will reduce the real interest rate,
boosting household consumption. The resulting rise in demand relative to supply will tend to push up on
inflation.
In many of our economic models, this ‘real interest rate channel’ is extremely powerful. In reality, its effects
may be mitigated somewhat by the many households who are unable to smooth their consumption across
time.7 It may also be harder to identify at the relatively low rates of inflation that we now enjoy in the UK.
Nonetheless, it is likely to be important for major purchases of durable goods such as houses or cars,
especially at times when inflation expectations pick up markedly.
As a result, in addition to any potential effects on the economy, a good understanding of inflation is likely to
be useful to households making major financial decisions. A key benefit of low and stable inflation is that it is
more predictable. With effective communication, that should have made it easier for households to track,
predict and act upon.
Public understanding of inflation and trust in monetary policy is also crucial for accountability. MPC members
are unelected officials, chosen for their technical expertise, but ultimately accountable to the public. It is
therefore crucial that we communicate our inflation target and our policy decisions accessibly to as wide an
audience as possible.
Expectations: surveys of households
Since 1999, the Bank of England has conducted an inflation attitudes survey to track households’
understanding of monetary policy issues.8 As part of that understanding, it includes various questions about
households’ inflation expectations. Specifically, it asks respondents how much they expect ‘prices in the
shops generally’ to change in the future, with the median response often taken as a summary measure.
Households are asked their expectations for the next 12 months and for the longer term (five years ahead).
The MPC also monitors a range of other measures of inflation expectations. In recent outturns, professional
forecasters’ and companies’ inflation expectations have remained close to or below their historical averages.

Financial market inflation expectations, in contrast, have increased slightly over the past few quarters,
especially at longer horizons.
Households’ short-term inflation expectations have been relatively stable recently, although they have
increased since their recent lows in 2016, a period when CPI inflation itself had been close to zero (Chart 3).
Households’ long-term inflation expectations have also picked up since 2016, with the Bank survey measure
increasing to a series high of 3.8% in Q2 (Chart 4). The increase in the Bank survey in the latest datapoint
has not been replicated in the other indicators, and there is some evidence that it partly reflects sampling
volatility. But the general upward trend is evident across all three surveys since 2016, albeit from historically
low levels. Part of the explanation may be that Brexit (more specifically its effect on sterling feeding through
to realised CPI inflation) has increased some households’ inflation expectations. I will come back to discuss
a more nuanced effect of Brexit uncertainty on median expectations later in the speech.

Households’ inflation expectations are likely influenced by their inflation perceptions: what they think inflation
currently is. So the Bank survey also asks households how they think prices have changed over the past 12
months. Chart 5 shows that there is a fairly close relationship between perceptions of price rises over the
past 12 months and expectations over the next 12 months, although less so with longer-term expectations.
How do household perceptions of price rises compare to the measured CPI data? Chart 6 shows that most
households have perceived faster price rises than the actual change in CPI inflation, with the median
perception around one percentage point higher on average over the period since 2004 (after the target had
changed from RPIX).

Household expectations of future price rises are also generally higher than ex-post realised CPI inflation
(Chart 7). This is true across surveys, and is perhaps unsurprising, given the close relationship between
households’ perceptions of inflation and their short-term expectations. It is also clearly evident in longer-term
expectations.
That difference aside, median household inflation expectations have had mixed success in forecasting future
inflation. Chart 8 adjusts expectations in the Bank survey to take account of the average difference between
household perceptions and actual rises in CPI. It then compares the adjusted, ex-ante forecast with ex-post
realised inflation. The forecast errors show little remaining bias once expectations are adjusted. But the
errors are somewhat large and persistent, suggesting that households do not always adjust their
expectations even when prices start rising more quickly or slowly than they had expected.

Why might households perceive (and expect) higher inflation than measured CPI? Since the survey question
does not specify any particular price index, one possibility is that households are not referring to the same
basket of goods and services. While the median household perception has been higher than CPI inflation
since 2004, it has averaged around the same rate as RPI and RPIX inflation.9 RPI is no longer classed by
the ONS as a national statistic, but it is still widely quoted in the media, and importantly, is used to uprate a
range of highly visible items such as pensions, rail fares and student loans. It seems possible that despite
the MPC’s inflation target changing to CPI after 2003, households may have continued referring to RPI/RPIX
when answering the survey question. If so, it would suggest an additional benefit to having a single,
preferred measure of consumer prices.10
This is not the whole story, however. Compared to either price index, household perceptions and
expectations fail to accurately track the observed volatility in the inflation data. The wider economics
literature suggests at least three other sets of reasons why households may perceive inflation differently to
the aggregate statistics: some psychological; some environmental; or some due to financial literacy.
The psychological reasons relate again to which prices respondents are referring to when they answer the
question. The ONS’s price indices are weighted according to average household spending patterns, but
different households will consume different baskets of goods and services. There is no guarantee that even
the median respondent faces the same basket as the CPI.
Even if they face the same consumption basket, households may show other cognitive biases when
answering the question. Households may focus on more visible price changes such as energy and food.
Chart 9 shows that UK short-term inflation expectations closely follow petrol prices, a relationship also
observed in other countries.11 There is a similar correlation with food prices (Chart 10). Households may also
recall personal experiences and place more weight on more salient events. There is evidence that large price
changes are more memorable than small ones, and price increases more so than decreases. Similarly,
people tend to remember recent and more frequent purchases more easily.12

9
RPI is the Retail Prices Index and RPIX is the Retail Prices Index excluding mortgage interest payments. RPI and RPIX inflation have
differed at points since 2004, but have tracked each other closely since 2011.
10
The choice of the measure used as the monetary policy target is a decision of HM Government, and set out for the MPC in our Remit.
The recent House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee (2019) report on ‘Measuring Inflation’ argued that ‘it is confusing for the public
to have multiple official measures of consumer price inflation in use.’ The ONS have identified several issues with the RPI, including a
‘formula effect’ that creates an upward bias in measured RPI inflation and an inferior approach to measuring owner-occupied housing.

The environmental factor relates to the aggregate level and volatility of inflation. In low-inflation countries, it
is less important to know the rate of price inflation.13 When making financial decisions, it is more costly to
ignore the effects of inflation when prices are increasing at 20% or 100% per year, relative to when they are
increasing at only 2% per year. In the economics jargon, this is an example of rational inattention: the idea
that attention is a scarce resource and is allocated to its best possible use. If inflation is not one those uses,
it may just reflect the success of the current framework in producing a low inflation environment. According to
one opinion survey, less than 10% of people in the UK see inflation or prices as an important issue facing
Britain today, compared to over 50% in the 1970s, when inflation was far higher.14
The final factor, which was previously discussed by my colleagues Andy Haldane (2017) and Ben Broadbent
(2019), is financial literacy. This term is broadly understood as the skill to process economic information to
make informed financial choices. It tends to be positively correlated with education and income.15 People
who are more financially literate tend to have a better idea of what inflation is and, consequently, are able to
make more informed consumption and saving decisions. Over the past three years, at least 15% of
households have responded that they have ‘no idea’ how prices have changed, up from around 10% at the
start of the decade, suggesting that this factor may be becoming more important.
To sum up, there are a number of reasons why household perceptions and expectations of price changes
may differ from measured CPI data. It could be that households are referring to a different basket of goods
and services, be it a different price index, or a subset of more visible goods. People may rationally opt not to
process all the information required to form accurate perceptions and expectations because the benefits do

not justify the costs. Or it could be that different levels of financial literacy affect households’ understanding
of inflation. I next explore these possibilities by looking at disaggregated survey data.
Beyond the median: the distribution of households’ inflation expectations
Do all households form expectations like the median? The short answer is no. Households’ perceptions and
expectations of inflation are highly dispersed.16 And some recent research has shown that this distribution
may contain additional relevant information about the inflation process.17 Moreover, there are also large
differences across demographic groups including gender, age and income.
Chart 11 shows the distribution of households’ 12-month ahead inflation expectations in the Bank survey. It
shows that there has consistently been a sizeable fraction of respondents who have expected prices to rise
far faster than the Bank’s 2% CPI inflation target. Since 2006, an average of one-third of the households who
formed an expectation predicted inflation above 4%. In that period, measured CPI inflation has only risen
above 4% around 10% of the time and measured RPIX inflation 23% of time. Again, this may just reflect a
different inflation basket. This fraction of respondents could devote a greater share of their overall spending
to goods and services with higher price rises.

However, the distribution also reveals a growing fraction of households who are unable to form inflation
expectations at all. This proportion of households answering ‘no idea’ is 19% in the latest Bank survey, up
from nearer 10% a decade ago. The volatility of the series makes it difficult to be certain of the cause. But
there does seem to have been an increase in ‘no idea’ responses since the EU referendum in 2016, so
16

I focus on the two surveys for which we have a detailed distributional breakdown, the Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey and
the Barclays Basix Inflation Survey. Both are conducted quarterly on a sample of UK households and weighted by demographic factors
to match the UK. From February 2016 the Inflation Attitudes Survey has been conducted on the Bank of England's behalf by TNS.
Previously it was conducted by GfK NOP.

Brexit uncertainty may be playing a role. This increase has been clearer still in questions on long-term
inflation expectations, where 44% of households now have no idea what inflation will be in five years’ time.
Irrespective of why it has increased, the proportion of households giving this response is quite large,
suggesting that the gap between households’ perceptions and reality may partly be due to differences in
financial literacy. Disaggregating the surveys according to demographics provides further evidence for this.

Starting with gender, a common finding in US studies has been that women have significantly higher inflation
expectations than men.18 Interestingly, this does not seem to be the case in the UK (Chart 12), where
women’s inflation expectations are broadly similar to those of men. There appears to be an important gender
divide in responses depending on how the question is framed.19 When asked about ‘prices in general’ in the
Bank survey, the distribution of responses between men and women is broadly similar. However, when

There is a large literature that shows that the framing of survey questions can lead to large differences in responses. See Tversky and

asked about the ‘inflation rate’ in the Barclays Basix survey, women are much more likely to report that they
don’t know (Chart 13). This is consistent with findings in other countries and could relate to differences in
financial literacy.20 Alternatively, it may relate to evidence from psychological research suggesting that in
areas such as finance, men tend to be more overconfident than women.21

Moving on to different age groups, many US studies have found that older generations have higher inflation
expectations than younger ones. One theory is that people living through different times have built up
different life experiences, which affects their view of the future.22 For example, older generations that can
vividly remember the high inflation of the 1970s will report higher expected inflation than younger
generations who have only experienced low inflation. In the UK surveys, the picture is mixed. Younger

people do report lower expected price rises in the Bank survey, but the opposite is true in the Barclays Basix
survey. Asking about the ‘inflation rate’ again exacerbates the gaps among different groups. Older
generations’ are better able to form expectations and also appear to predict movements in CPI inflation more
successfully (Charts 14 and 15).

Finally, there are differences according to socioeconomic status, as measured by National Readership
Survey (NRS) classification, which ranks households according to the chief income earner’s occupation. It
therefore captures a mix of income and education. Chart 16 shows that households in lower classifications
tend to have higher inflation expectations, which could be due to different consumption baskets (if they
consume more of the goods and services that have higher inflation rates). But households in the lowest
classification are also far less likely to be able to provide an expectation for future price changes, with around
35% answering ‘no idea’ in the Barclays Basix survey, compared to 15% of the top group (Chart 17). The
gap is again larger when asking about the ‘inflation rate’ than ‘prices’, suggesting differences in financial
literacy as a factor.

A quick detour on long-term inflation expectations
So far I have focused on one-year ahead expectations but I would like to briefly touch upon long-term
expectations. In our models, it is long-term inflation expectations that matter more for financial decisions. And
since short-term expectations tend to be influenced more by volatility in current inflation, households’
long-term expectations can often give a cleaner signal of their confidence in the MPC’s commitment to bring
inflation back to target at an appropriate horizon.
In that context, the increase in median long-term inflation expectations in the latest Bank survey – to a series
high of 3.8% – may appear concerning. While something we should watch closely, there is some evidence
from the individual survey responses that at least part of the increase represents sampling volatility.
Consistent with that hypothesis, it has not been replicated in the other surveys we monitor.
Over a longer time horizon, median long-term inflation expectations have increased since the EU
referendum. This could be partly related to the referendum-driven fall in sterling and subsequent increase in
CPI inflation. But the distribution of responses suggests a nuanced interpretation. While the median
expectation has increased since 2016 Q2, the proportion of overall respondents expecting inflation above
3% has not (Chart 18). The reason for the increase seems to be a rise in the proportion answering ‘no idea’
(which has increased from 34% to 44%) and a fall in the proportion answering between 1% and 3%. One
possibility is that given the climate of uncertainty since 2016, some households who had previously assumed
that inflation would always return to target now feel unable to form any expectation at all.

We should also bear in mind that people generally find it difficult to answer questions about things far into the
future: in the latest survey, the number of ‘no ideas’ increases from 19% to 44% as we extend the horizon
from one to five years ahead (Chart 19), with a similar pattern evident in the Barclays Basix survey.
Let me take stock here. When we look beneath the average, we see that there are specific groups of the
population that tend to report price change expectations further from the inflation target and from the official
data on CPI inflation. There are also differences in the characteristics of respondents unable to form an
expectation of future inflation. These respondents are more likely to be women than men; to be young than
old; and to be in low income occupations.
Implications and some remarks on the policy outlook
When it comes to setting monetary policy, these results call for caution in interpreting movements in median
measures of household inflation expectations. Interpreting the median is tricky when there are changes in the
number of households who respond that they do not know. This is especially true for long-term inflation
expectations, which are typically most relevant for policy.
For communicating monetary policy and improving public understanding of the inflation targeting framework,
the large fraction of households who are unable to form an expectation of future inflation is a concern,
particularly if it is due to a lack of financial literacy. It makes the steps we have been making on the MPC to
improve our communications all the more important. For example, since 2017, we have published a visual
summary of our Inflation Report, which aims to be accessible to a wide audience.23
More broadly, the Bank of England has been taking steps to improve its educational outreach, as discussed
by Haldane (2017), Carney (2018) and recently by Broadbent (2019). Last year my colleagues at the Bank

launched econoME, an educational programme designed for young people aged from 11 to 16, which aims
to improve economic and financial literacy.
The results I have presented today suggest that young people may particularly benefit from improved
financial literacy, so improving education for school-age children is crucial. I think that there also remains
space to design programmes for slightly older age groups. Here, there is scope for other institutions, like
universities, colleges and even employers to help people develop the skills to make more informed choices.
I’ve talked about a concrete challenge for communications when a significant and growing fraction of
households do not have a strong understanding of the inflation process. Today the challenge is made more
difficult by the current economic outlook. Uncertainty is the word dominating the mood.
Globally, uncertainty has shown up most clearly in interest rate expectations. Forward rate expectations have
fallen in recent months, with market participants now expecting an imminent rate cut in the United States and
a continued looser policy stance in the euro area. Risky asset prices had also weakened, although those
falls have likely been cushioned by lower risk-free rates.
Increases in trade tensions have been one source of heightened uncertainty, adding further downside risks
to a global economy where growth had already slowed over the past 18 months. And a further weakening in
sentiment has been evident in output surveys, particularly in manufacturing. The change in sentiment is hard
to reconcile with standard trade models, which would predict small direct effects of the tariffs announced so
far on large economies such as the US. It is possible that sentiment is responding to broader risks or indirect
spillovers not captured in our models.
Some of the moves in risk-free curves are also no doubt related to a weaker global inflation outlook. Despite
increases in wage growth, core inflation has remained subdued in the US and in euro area, increasing
market expectations of looser monetary policy. Unlike in the UK, there have been large falls in financial
market measures of inflation expectations in both regions.
Domestically, Brexit uncertainty continues to play a key role in financial market pricing, as set out recently by
Carney (2019). As the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen, pricing has more clearly diverged
with the MPC’s forecast assumption of a smooth transition to a new trading arrangement. Sterling has
depreciated and market-implied Bank Rate expectations now suggest that the next move will be a cut. But
those expectations average across a range of very different Brexit scenarios – with markets expecting looser
policy (and a weaker pound) in a no deal scenario.
The MPC has explained how in the event of a disorderly exit, the monetary policy response will depend on
the balance of the effects on supply, demand and the exchange rate. As I set out in March, in my view it is
more likely than not that the appropriate response would be a loosening, but this is by no means certain.

The fall in UK yields is not solely due to perceived changes in the probabilities of different Brexit outcomes.
Increased trade tensions and weaker global sentiment are also likely to have spilled over to the UK. Brexit
uncertainty has also injected volatility into the outlook for UK activity, with stockpiling responsible for part of
the strong growth figure in Q1, which looks likely to give way to a far weaker outturn in Q2.
But the labour market remains tight: employment and hours worked growth have been strong (although
average hours seem also to have been boosted by stockpiling in the manufacturing sector). So too has unit
labour cost growth, even if wage growth is showing signs of slowing slightly from its 2018 pace. And
conditional on a smooth Brexit scenario, a healthy labour market should continue to support household
consumption.
Moreover, although measures of core inflation remain subdued relative to labour costs, they have been
stable in recent months. Nor are there many signs of weakness in the UK data on inflation expectations. As a
result, I still expect that in a smooth Brexit scenario, a small amount of policy tightening will be required over
the forecast period to keep demand growing in line with supply.
As for the timing of any tightening; with inflation currently at 2% and likely to fall temporarily below target in
the coming months, I did not feel compelled to vote for a policy change at our June meeting. If a Brexit
agreement is reached, sterling is likely to appreciate, especially given the prospect of relatively looser
monetary policy abroad. A stronger pound would serve to dampen import price growth, moderating upward
pressure on CPI inflation from strong labour cost growth. Coupled with signs of a weaker global outlook,
recent developments likely lengthen the period until there is a sufficient pickup in inflationary pressures for
me to vote to raise Bank Rate. I do not currently anticipate such a pickup in the next few months.
As always, this is my expectation, not a promise. As the data evolve, so too may my view of the appropriate
policy setting. If so I will strive to communicate any change in my thinking to economists, to financial markets,
and importantly, to the general public.
