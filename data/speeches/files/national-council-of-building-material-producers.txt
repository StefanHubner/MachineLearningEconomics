Few industries have suffered more from volatility of the British economy than yours, and the past few months
have been more volatile than most. "The times they are a-changing" would be an appropriate theme tune for
all of us. What has changed the economic climate over the past two to three months? Here at home the most
obvious sign has been a sudden decline in business and consumer confidence. The fall in the CBI's measure
of business optimism over the last two quarters is the largest seen since the early 1980s. The level of
consumer confidence appears more robust, but it too has also fallen since the middle of this year.

Away from home, the major development has been increased fragility in the international economy.
Following the default on its debt by the Russian government, the imposition of capital controls by Malaysia,
and the near collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, financial markets world-wide have
exhibited extraordinary volatility, driven by a fear of risk, a flight to quality and liquidity, and the beginning of a
significant reduction in leverage by financial institutions. What does this turbulence mean for the British
economy?

Before answering that question, I want to say a few words about the Monetary Policy Committee. Just under
two weeks ago, the Monetary Policy Committee, for the first time in its short history, cut interest rates. When
I accepted your invitation to speak today, I did not know that I would be able to explain to you the reasons
behind our latest decision. For, until today, the minutes of our meetings were published with a lag of some
five to six weeks. But, as the Bank announced earlier this month, the minutes will now be published only two
weeks after the monthly meetings. And the minutes from our meeting on 7-8 October were published at
9.30am this morning. This increase in transparency should help commentators and financial markets alike to
assess the actions of the MPC and to predict its future decisions. As I have said on other occasions, the aim
of the MPC is to pursue economic stability, not to spring surprises on an unsuspecting world. Surprises may
be good for newspapers, but not for most other businesses.

So what were the issues facing the MPC two weeks ago? Remember that the aim of the MPC is to hit an
inflation target of 22. Sometimes inflation will be above the target, sometimes below. But over a run of years
the outturn should be as close to 22 as possible. It is central to our remit that deviations of inflation from the
target are regarded symmetrically. Inflation can be too low as well as too high. For over thirty years, central
banks have not, until recently, had many opportunities to show that they understand this. I can assure you
that the MPC does. When circumstances change, as they have over the past few months, then so will our
policy.

The recent turbulence in international financial markets brings a new set of problems and risks, over and
above those that resulted from the Asian crisis which started in the second half of last year. It is important to
distinguish between the crisis of the so-called "tiger" economies in Asia, which, although clearly impacting on
world trade, was indeed largely restricted to Asia, and the more recent financial contagion which has afflicted
almost all emerging markets and affected the financial system of the industrialised world.

There are three aspects of the world economy which are relevant to our own position. First, private capital
flows to emerging markets have in many cases come to an abrupt halt. That will have consequences for
trade balances and activity in both emerging markets and industrialised countries. Second, falls in equity
prices around the world have reduced household wealth. And, third, the sudden increase in risk aversion in
financial markets is changing the balance sheets of financial institutions and some fear that this may lead to
a credit crunch.

The reduction in capital flows to emerging markets started over a year ago when concerns about the foreign
currency exposures of a number of countries led to withdrawals of funds and a liquidity crisis in Asia. That
liquidity problem was compounded by macroeconomic and structural problems which varied from country to
country. But the net effect was that capital flows to emerging markets in Asia fell from over $110 bn in 1996
to only about $10 bn in 1997. That retrenchment has continued during 1998. Why does this matter? In the
absence of other sources of finance, a reduction in net capital inflows has to be matched by a corresponding
improvement in the current accounts of the emerging market economies. To achieve such a rapid turn-round
in the current account required significant depreciations of their currencies and deep recessions. The
counterpart to the improvement in the current account of the countries affected is a larger trade deficit, or
smaller trade surplus, in the rest of the world. The UK is not immune to this change in trade balances, and
the impact of the Asian crisis on our exports has, of course, been compounded by the rise in sterling since
1996.

If the Asian crisis affected most a relatively young, and only temporarily wounded, tiger, the recent
turbulence was heralded by the growl of a much older, more grizzly, bear. The announcement by the
Russian government on 17 August of its intention to restructure payments on its domestic bonds led to a
fundamental reappraisal of international investors' willingness to bear risk. The reappraisal caused the
average cost of capital to emerging market economies - measured by interest rates on their bonds - to rise to
levels not seen since the immediate aftermath of the Mexican crisis in 1995. This increase in cost is likely to
lead to a further reduction in net capital flows to emerging markets and so magnify the adverse trade effect
faced by the industrialised world.

Second, the greater aversion to risk has led to falls in equity prices throughout the industrialised world. The
FT/S&P world stock market price index has fallen by nearly 12% since its peak three months ago. In the UK,
the FT-All Share fell by nearly 20% over the same period. The fall in equity prices is likely to lead to both

lower consumption growth, as consumers adjust to the fall in net wealth, and lower investment growth, as
firms react to the higher cost of capital.

Third, the heightened aversion of financial institutions to risk has led to fears of a "credit crunch". A credit
crunch occurs when lending institutions try to reduce their exposure to risk and, in so doing, the size of their
balance sheets. In recent weeks, the desire of these institutions to reduce the scale of their leveraging and
move to less risky portfolios has led to a reduction in the amount of capital available to support liquid
financial markets. As a result, asset prices of all kinds have been volatile. So far the consequences of
turbulence in financial markets have been largely restricted to securities markets, especially in the United
States. These markets are somewhat less important in the provision of corporate finance in the UK, although
if the reduction in security market issuance were to persist this could affect the ability of the personal and
corporate sectors to obtain finance from both banks and the capital market. As yet lending by UK banks has
not been affected to any significant extent. The monetary statistics published yesterday show that total bank
credit grew by 0.7% in September, leaving the 12-month growth unchanged at 8.7%.

The MPC will watch carefully for any signs of a credit crunch developing. The Bank monitors indicators of
credit conditions in the financial markets on a daily basis. And the MPC has asked the Bank's regional
Agents to conduct a survey of borrowing conditions faced by businesses around the country in time for the
MPC meeting in November.

The international situation is, of course, only one of the factors that influence interest rates. In the August
Inflation Report, the MPC made clear that it expected - indeed wanted - the growth of domestic demand to
continue to slow throughout this year and into next. A slowdown is necessary because, as the restraining
effects on retail prices from the rise in sterling start to wear off, domestically generated inflation must fall if
the inflation target is to be met.

The latest data from the Office for National Statistics show that domestic demand and output have been
growing broadly in line with the desired path. But survey data show a markedly weaker picture for output and
orders, both over recent months and, more importantly, looking ahead. The lags with which changes in
monetary policy affect the economy means that the MPC can not wait to find out whether the surveys provide
an accurate prediction before it sets policy. Each month the MPC balances the information contained in
official statistics, surveys, anecdote, and the impressions of conditions in industry relayed to us by our
network of regional agents.

An issue of considerable importance is the state of the labour market. The August Inflation Report argued
that the outlook for inflation depended critically upon the labour market and, in particular, on the behaviour of
earnings. At the time of that Report the latest figure for earnings growth was 5.4%. Given historical levels of
productivity growth of around 2%, this level of earnings growth was, on the face of it, incompatible in the
long-run with the inflation target of 22. That led to an extended discussion during the summer, both within the

MPC and among commentators in the press and the City, about the extent to which those levels of earnings
growth had been distorted by the impact of bonuses during the Spring of this year and so might be expected
to fall in due course without the need for an easing of pressures in the labour market.

Since August, the estimates of this key economic statistic have been revised - not once, but twice. The good
news - somewhat ironic given the amount of attention it attracted earlier this year - is that as a result of these
revisions the "great bonus debate" of the summer has become a non-issue. Bonuses, we are now told, if
anything, subtracted from, not added to, the growth of earnings in March and April of this year. The bad
news, however, is that if before the revisions it was difficult to know how to interpret the impact of bonuses
on earnings growth, it is, I think it is fair to say, now extremely difficult to know how to interpret any aspect of
the earnings data.

Statistics, official or otherwise, are neither right nor wrong. They are estimates which are often revised as
new information becomes available. But what is striking about the recent revisions is that the changes do not
result from any new information about earnings, but simply from a change in the procedures used to weight
together the earnings in different firms and industries. It may be that this change has made it more difficult to
make comparisons of earnings over time, and hence to measure underlying earnings growth.

Whatever the explanation, there has certainly been a change in the estimated profile of earnings growth over
the past two years. The revised data suggest that instead of rising steadily throughout last year, as the
economy grew at above trend rates and the labour market tightened, the rate of growth of earnings actually
fell. From a peak of 5.3% in February last year, earnings growth is now estimated to have slowed
consistently until March of this year, when it reached a level of 3.9%. This deceleration in earnings growth
coincided with a period in which, according to the Labour Force Survey, the labour market tightened
considerably: employment rose by 360 thousand, unemployment fell by 320 thousand and the
unemployment rate fell from 7.8% to 6.5%. Over the same period wage settlements accelerated. And the
revised data imply that since March of this year, as the pace of economic growth has slowed, earnings
growth has accelerated, from 3.9% in March to 5.2% in June.

It is not easy, therefore, to reconcile the revised earnings data with other information on the labour market.
And these data really matter for the MPC's assessment of the UK economy. I can promise you that the Bank,
the Treasury, and the Office for National Statistics, will, as a matter of urgency, be working together to try to
understand what is happening to earnings.

Decisions on interest rates must take into account not only those factors which I have highlighted this
morning - the international economy, the possibility of a credit crunch and uncertainty about the trend in
earnings growth - but also a wide range of other information relevant to the outlook for inflation, including the
behaviour of the monetary aggregates, which are still growing quite rapidly, and the fall in sterling's effective
exchange rate. Over the next two weeks more important data will become available, including the first

regional Agents. At our next meeting on 4 and 5 November, the MPC will take into account all of this
information, and occasions like today are part of the process by which we obtain more information and
exchange views with those most directly affected by our decisions.
