Asymmetry at heart of IMFS is growing
US share of global
economy shrinking…

…yet network effects mean US $ dominates
international trade and finance

• US developments have large spillovers, even for countries with limited direct exposure

IMFS asymmetry increases risks of a global liquidity trap
• IMFS structurally lowering global equilibrium interest rate, r*, by:
- feeding a global savings glut: EMEs defensively accumulate reserves of safe
US $ assets against backdrop of inadequate and fragmented global financial
safety net;
- lowering the rate of global potential growth due to less sustainable cross
border flows; and
- increasing the downside skew and fattening of the left-hand tail of likely
economic outcomes.
• Increasingly integrated world: global r* exerts greater influence on domestic r*.
• Strains become more evident when – as recently – US conditions warrant tighter
policy there than elsewhere.

Medium term: reshuffle the deck – reform current IMFS
EME

Address pull factors in EMEs:
Reinforcing monetary stability, including by safeguarding central bank
independence
Ensuring resilience of domestic financial sector
Moderate push factors:
Strengthen resilience of banks at the core of the global financial system
Make sure investment funds prudently manage leverage and liquidity
Fix the pipes of the global system:
Reinforcing the Global Financial Safety Net, by ensuring that IMF resources are
maintained
Further improve IMF surveillance for analysing spillovers and traction to support
coordinated actions
12

Long term: change the game – move to a multipolar system
Benefits of multiple reserve currencies
Diversification: the supply of safe assets increases, lowering the downward
pressures on the global equilibrium interest rate
Reduced spillovers from the core, including less synchronised trade and financial
cycles

Easier to manage coordination problems
No illusions that IMFS can be reformed overnight
- Network effects reinforce dominance of US $
- Transition to a new global reserve currency didn’t proceed smoothly in the past and
may not in the future
- Doesn’t make sense to swap one reserve currency for another; a multipolar world
deserves multipolar system

13

Consider for long term: Synthetic Hegemonic Currency
• Publicly issued basket of central bank digital currencies made widely available to settle
payments and store value

SHC

 Central bank liabilities are safe, already widely-accepted means of
payment
 Reliable, instantaneous, low cost domestic and international
payments
 Addresses many of the shortcomings of private sector solutions
(privacy, treasury management, trust)
 Decision between wholesale (SDR) vs. retail (SHC) must be
mindful that usage as medium of exchange has historically driven
reserve currency adoption
