1. Introduction
Over the last week or so, many advanced economy central banks increased their policy
rates. The Federal Reserve increased by 25 basis points, the European Central Bank and
the Bank of England by 50, although the Bank of Canada signalled a pause and
the Bank of Japan maintained its updated yield curve control target. It seems that at least
some central bankers are seeing a turning point in data to which they are responding with
an inflection in their respective policy paths. Recent market chatter has focused on when
central banks will stop hiking and if they will reverse, with fears torn between the risks of
overtightening and stopping too soon. What has everyone been looking for and what have
they seen?
It is worthwhile even to consider what we mean by a turning point. In general, it reflects
data that reveal transition points between phases of a business cycle. This can help guide
monetary policy makers with the calibration of future policy. It is difficult, though, to identify
a cyclical turning point in real time, even more so to foresee one ahead of time so that
policies (and portfolios) can be adapted to the future path of the macroeconomy.
Harbingers of macroeconomic turning points may occur at different points in time in
different parts of the macroeconomy, and in different regions across the world, even when
hit by a common global shock. Moreover, what represents a turning point in the data which
would lead to a re-assessment of policy is related to the mandate of the central bank.
Calibrating policy to affect inflation is key for all, but some have to be equally mindful of
how policy affects other metrics of macroeconomic performance, for example employment.
One approach to identifying turning points puts substantial weight on forecasts from large
macroeconomic models, because these take account of the complex inter-relationships
among economic variables and policy. One must be humble about the stability of the
relationships, for example of inflation dynamics and the monetary policy transmission
mechanism, that underlie predicted turning points and macro outcomes. Adding to these
uncertainties are policy spillovers. For example, as a UK monetary policy maker, I am
mindful of other central banks decisions, as reflected in their assessment of their turning
points, and their impact on the UK economic situation.
All this adds up to acknowledging that macro data and forecasts need to be complemented
by a range of more granular data and higher frequency assessments of what data presage
the turning points in the inflation process that represents, according to our remit, a
sustainable return to the 2% target. Putting too much trust in simple, linear, historically
estimated macro-relationships risks making a policy mistake when uncertainty is high
(Mann, 2022a). My reading of the more granular data and likely asymmetries in the

Bank of England

inflation process has led me to vote for a more robust monetary policy path that stays the
course because inflation dynamics have not yet been quelled.
Today, I’d like to put more structure on how I think about these turning points, mostly by
using the UK as an example, but also with some views across regions and through the
lens of different channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

2. Current conjuncture

To start, let’s look at the macro top-line: headline inflation in Chart 1. Is there a turning
point already visible in the data? For the US and the euro area, yes; for the UK, maybe
stabilization. Considering just the UK, is stabilization of headline inflation the signal that
we are done? Or do we need to wait longer, including for other parts of the economy to
turn, before a policy pause or reversal is appropriate? A closer inspection of the chart
shows that inflation components particularly exposed to external drivers are not all
moderating. Energy prices are capped for now, and goods prices are decelerating, but
food prices continue to surge, increasing to 16.8% in December, at a 45-year high.
Services inflation posted at 6.8%, a 30-year high; and it has been at or over 6% for
5 consecutive months. Depending on the set of underlying inflation contributors one might
look at, one could come to different conclusions, and possibly identify multiple turning
points. The stabilization of headline inflation, therefore, is not yet the harbinger of a turning
point towards a sustainable return to the 2% target.

November for US PCE.

But maybe a turning point could be in the offing? A simple view of the inflation process is
that inflation comes from ‘too much demand relative to supply’ (frequently termed as the
output gap). Based on this simple assessment, Chart 2 shows the demand side, and
thereby sheds more light on the recent inflation behaviour of the three regions. UK GDP
was about at target over the pre-Covid period 2010-19, when GDP was about on trend - so
supply equalled demand. Now, the UK’s demand condition is notable in failing to return to
the pre-Covid level of GDP, much less approach its pre-Covid trend. Yet, inflation is
stubbornly high in the UK.

All three regions faced a sequence of shocks to both demand and supply - first, the Covid
and lockdown-induced global demand rotation and subsequent supply bottlenecks yielded
high goods prices, chip shortages, and output problems around the world. Before the
economy had a chance to return to equilibrium, the energy shock caused by Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine raised gas prices globally, but because of more fragmented markets,
had implications far more dire for the euro area and UK. However, the UK has also been
affected by a third type of shock which makes it unique: no other country chose to
unilaterally impose trade barriers on its closest trading partners (Freeman et al., 2022).
Focusing on just the supply side now, the trend in potential supply has shifted down
according to the most recent supply stocktake reviewed in last Thursday’s
Bank of England Monetary Policy Report.1 It appears that increases in early retirement and
long-term illness have reduced labor supply and Brexit has reduced trade and investment

efficiencies. Supply weakness can be an important ingredient in the search for turning
points in inflation, even if demand is weak as well.

3. Real-time indicators of macroeconomic turning points

First, turning to the labour market to look for turning points, rising unemployment is an
ex-post indicator of the business cycle, not a harbinger. But early warning of turning points
in the labor market can presage a turning point in wage growth, which might herald a
turning point in the rate of price inflation.
The ratio of the number of vacancies to the number of unemployed (also known as the V/U
ratio), is a leading indicator and summary statistic of labor market tightness. Chart 3
shows that while the ratio has fallen in recent months, it remains at record highs, driven
both by high vacancy levels and low unemployment rates in the UK. This is a unique
combination historically in the UK labor market, which highlights why current labor market
conditions don’t resemble the behaviour after previous supply shocks such as the 1970s.
Typically, the V/U ratio is strongly pro-cyclical, so this ratio should fall in recessions and
rise in booms. But the step-change in the level of the ratio post-Covid means it is hard to
read how far we should expect the ratio to fall in advance of a possible future recession.2

The V/U ratio may not be as good a bellwether for a coming recession, but may be useful
when thinking about wage inflation. If there is a mismatch between UK labour demand and
supply, in part driven by the structural changes in the labour market that Covid and
lockdowns brought about, and in part due to the rapid rise in production costs for firms
resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, then wage growth could stay stronger for
longer, presenting upside risk to inflation.
But the labor market is just one source of information on turning points. The OECD’s
Composite Leading Indicator (Chart 4) provides a qualitative assessment of early signals
of turning points in business cycles drawing on a vast amount of underlying data.3 A fall
below the long term average indicates a negative deviation from trend, and thus warns of
recession. At the moment, the UK indicator is quite a notable outlier compared to either
Germany or the US in indicating a large, negative deviation from long-term average.

See the OECD Short-Term Indicators Dashboard. OECD CLIs are constructed from economic time
series that have similar cyclical fluctuations to those of the business cycle, but, and importantly, which
precede those of the business cycle. They contain a selected subset of the MEI database, which covers
macroeconomic indicators for the following major subject areas: (1) GDP and its components and industrial
production, (2) selected commodity output variables (crude steel, crude petroleum etc.), (3) business and
consumer tendency survey series, (4) selected manufacturing variables (deliveries, stocks, new orders etc.),

Past data indicates reasonable accuracy in front-running downturns in activity. This is
consistent with the view that the UK suffers not only from the Covid and energy shocks,
but also the negative supply shock - the “worst of all worlds”.

The only times the UK measure was this negative were during the Great Financial Crisis
and during the 1973-75 recession. However, consistent with our remit, what we are
actually looking for is a turning point on inflation. And only in one of those cases did
inflation come down, in the other it stayed persistently high. In interpreting this chart, we
should consider whether the overall economic situation is more like 1973 than 2009 – and
position monetary policy accordingly.4
Financial market measures, particularly the yield curve, can also be used to infer market
participants’ perceptions of turning points, for demand and inflation. In normal times, yield
curves tend to slope upwards, as investors demand a premium for holding longer term
bonds (also known as term premium). When the slope turns negative, the yield curve is
said to be inverted, which is viewed by some as an early indicator of a recession.5 For
expectations of shorter term yields to be higher than longer term yields, markets must
either expect central banks to tighten in the short term and thereby induce a recession, or

4

Of course, there was no independent MPC and no explicit inflation target in the 1970s but I think it is still
useful to note that there can be a recession while inflation stays high.
5 Favero et al. (2019) show that the predictive power of the yield curve slope declined in the post-GFC but
pre-Covid sample as it relies on short-term policy rates being correlated with future growth.

anticipate central banks needing to cut interest rates at some point in the future in
response to a recession (Benzoni et al., 2018).
Chart 5 shows that since the 1970s, the UK yield curve slope has been positive over 82%
of the time. It turned negative in late 2022, for the first time since 2008. Taking into
account the endogenous reaction of yields to monetary policy and forward guidance, to
me, this indicates that the economy is in a transitionary phase, as is monetary policy.

There are two potential caveats to the yield curve as a turning point indicator. While
statistically it has predicting power, it’s accuracy on how far away the downturn may be
can vary quite significantly. And finally, it is important not to forget that yields are highly
correlated across major economies, shown by the strong co-movement of lines in Chart 5,
highlighting the importance of the global financial cycle (Miranda-Agrippino & Rey, 2020)
and international spillovers. Therefore, the signal for any one particular economy might be
mixed with signals about the general direction of the world economy, and in particular the
US.

4. Expectations and turning points

Inflation expectations have played a particularly important role for my monetary policy
decisions (Mann, 2022a and 2022b). I have emphasized not just the mean or median
responses, but that the whole distribution of expectations matter for monetary policy. In
previous speeches, I have referenced the DMP survey of expectations by firms of their
own prices one year ahead. Although still skewed, the right tail of these distributions have
started to tighten, and the mean expected price one year ahead has fallen somewhat to
5.7%. If realized, however, this is still quite far above 2%.
Household expectations are particularly important for inflation dynamics. Only if
households are willing to pay their prices can firms realize their expected pricing power; if
there is a buyer revolt that could signal a turning point. Chart 6 shows the difference
between point estimates of the right and left tails of household inflation expectation
distributions two years ahead, which takes us to 2025, near the end of the MPC’s forecast
horizon. This is a measure of asymmetry in the distribution of inflation expectations. The
higher this measure, the larger is the right tail relative to the left. This measure peaked in
Q3 2022, suggesting that that right tail - which represents an upside risk to the monetary
policy maker - may be moderating. However Q3 2022 was also the peak of energy prices
and mortgage rates. Regardless, expectations remain positively skewed and, at 4.5% on
average, well above target-consistent rates.

5. Inflation forecasts and turning points

Zooming out from the more granular and higher frequency data to search for turning
points, and as a rationale for spending so much time on these other indicators, I would like
to show how macro forecasts for the UK economy have evolved over the last year. These
forecasts come from the Monetary Policy Reports in which the MPC sets out its best
collective judgement about the likely evolution of the UK economy over the next three
years.
Obviously, predicting inflation has been particularly difficult over the past few years. It is
not surprizing that macroeconomic predictions haven’t been able to keep pace with the
inflation shocks, which is shown by the vintages of projections in Chart 7. I’d rather focus
on the medium-term, where inflation in all these vintages, is projected to be around the
target of 2% by the middle of 2024, to then fall further, or not, depending on the forecast
vintage. These projections incorporate conditioning assumptions of announced fiscal
policy and the market expectations for the Bank Rate. But they also reflect chosen
econometric methods and past economic relationships.

Broadly speaking, the deceleration of inflation in the forecast in 2025 comes from, on the
one hand, the assumption that global energy, food, and goods prices are expected to stop
rising as dramatically as they did in 2021 and 2022 or even outright fall - though not to
prior levels as can be seen on the left-hand side - but also that expected weakness in
demand relative to supply should discipline domestic price and wage setting. As the first
happens and then the second, in the annual calculation of inflation, high monthly increases
would drop out and be replaced by low growth or decreases (‘base effects’). The
moderation of inflation on the way down would be a mirror of the acceleration on the way
up. But considering asymmetries after the turning point is as important as identifying it in
the first place: even when we reach a turning point for example in inflation, that does not
necessarily mean prices will react the same way up as down.
One trouble with looking at these inflation forecasts is that the annual inflation number not
only picks-up price pressures today but also price pressures nearly a year ago. Actually,
annual inflation is predominantly a lagging indicator of underlying price pressures. That
makes it difficult to discern when a turning point in inflation is happening.
One reason to focus on the annual inflation figure is, of course, that it is explicitly referred
to in our remit, frequently reported in the media, and so can give an important steer to
wage negotiations and price expectations. But it is also the case that higher-frequency
inflation measures month-to-month can be too volatile to give a good read in real time. So,
an annual measure lags and high-frequency is too volatile.

As an intermediate approach consider Chart 8. It plots changes between rolling threemonth average prices in headline (LHS) and core CPI (RHS) at annualized rates. It shows,
therefore, what the annual, year-on-year inflation rate would be if price changes between
these three month-periods were to compound for a whole year.

Source: ONS, BLS, Eurostat, and Bank calculations. Notes: Charts show growth in three-month averages of
seasonally-adjusted consumer prices over the preceding three-month average. Core CPI for the UK is CPI
less energy, food, and non-alcoholic beverages, for US it is CPI less energy and food, and for EA it is CPI
less energy, food, and non-alcoholic beverages as reported by the respective statistical authority. Latest
observation: December 2022.

The US looks different first with distinct inflationary surges taking inflation to double digits,
on account of large fiscal stimulus, even though the US was never as exposed to high
energy prices as the rest of the world. Then within just half a year, headline CPI inflation
has decelerated rapidly to barely over 3% and core CPI to just over 4%. Can we expect
these inflation dynamics to be repeated for the UK?
The UK’s headline inflation has shown a steady acceleration throughout 2021 and 2022
(with a spike in April 2022 due to the jump in the Ofgem cap). Inflation rates have firmed
around 10% in headline and 6% in core on a 3 month over 3 month annualized basis.
There is no clear turning point in these UK data, which puts a premium on the other, more
granular assessments of turning points.

6. Monetary policy strategy

Chart 9 shows how financial market-implied policy rate expectations were continuously
revised through the forecast vintages, which in turn also affected the forecast, since these
curves are a key conditioning assumption. The shifting peak in the market-implied curve,
both in level space and timing of a peak in the hiking cycle, reflects the extent of
uncertainty both around the evolution of data that underpins MPC decisions, as well as the
MPC’s reaction function. The shift up and steepness of the curve as well as its reversal
reflect market expectations of the path that the MPC would need to take in order to meet
its target.

From where we started pre-Covid, economies faced a series of shocks to both demand
and supply. Taken together with the evidence of the persistence of inflation as well as
shifting expectations, achieving the 2% target will require a period of restrictive monetary

Bank of England

Page 15

policy. The higher frequency and more granular data, along with the model output, help to
evaluate whether monetary policy has been sufficiently restrictive for long enough.
A seemingly more direct criterion is the “Taylor principle”.6 That is, in response to an
unexpected increase in inflation, the nominal interest rate must rise by more than
one-for-one, such that the real rate increases. Easy in theory, but in practice the choice of
nominal interest rate and deflator, at what time horizon, over what duration, and relative to
what long-run equilibrium real rate are all up for grabs.
Chart 10 below shows the quarterly average yield on a one-year UK government bond
deflated by households’ inflation expectations for the year ahead. It is therefore designed
to answer the question: “What is the expected inflation-adjusted return on a safe
investment taken over the next four quarters?”

For the canonical view, see for example Taylor (1999) and Clarida et al. (1999). It can be shown that if the
monetary policymaker puts a high weight on slack in the economy, a weight on inflation that is less than one
can still result in a determinate price level (Gali, 2008). However, this technically only holds for a zero
inflation steady state. Ascari & Sbordone (2014) show that with positive trend inflation, the region of
determinacy shrinks quickly to cover only increasingly high inflation weights. On the other hand, Angeletos &
Lian (2021) find that introducing only minor amounts of myopia rules out the problem of indeterminacy
prevalent in models with infinitely forward-looking agents.

Bank of England

Page 16

If we think that expected real returns are what determine consumption and investment
decisions, all other things equal, a falling real rate ought to make these cheaper (and
thereby stimulate the economy) and a rising real rate ought to make these more
expensive.7 If real rates fall in response to an inflationary shock, the stance of monetary
policy actually becomes more expansionary regardless of the direction of nominal rates.
Arguably, this is exactly what happened in the 1970s: nominal rates rose but never enough
to offset the rising inflationary momentum. As a result, real rates actually fell which allowed
inflation to become entrenched.
In contrast, over the last couple of quarters, despite rising inflation, we have been
successful in keeping real rates from falling. Therefore, I do not view it likely that we are in
a 1970s-style unanchoring of inflation expectations with all the unpleasant side effects.
Once inflation and inflation expectations return to the 2% target, it will be appropriate to
reverse nominal rates.
So, why keep raising nominal rates now?
First, the real rate in the chart is as much about expectations of future inflation as it is
about expectations of policy. If we were perceived as being complacent about inflation,
nominal expected yields may come down too soon, mechanically decreasing real rates,
and prematurely loosening the stance of monetary policy. If there is uncertainty about the
degree of inflation persistence, it is better to assume a high degree because the costs of
making a mistake if the true inflation process is more persistent are larger than if the true
inflation process is less persistent.
Second, I see material upside risks to our inflation outlook. To achieve target-consistent
CPI, the moderation of inflation this year has to be as rapid and complete on the downside
as its ratchet-up was last year. The stickiness of one-year ahead, and even more so
2-3-year ahead expectations, and virtually any length contract period point to upside risk.
This would again decrease real rates, thus requiring higher nominal rates for longer
(Mann, 2022b). From a risk-management point of view, monetary policy has to lean
against these upside biases since wage and price inflation are still so high.
Third, why not wait - that is pause the hiking cycle - to see if the inflation dynamics are
what I think they are? If inflation indeed is more persistent, then Bank Rate will need to rise
again after the pause, to be followed later with reversal. In my view, a tighten-stop-tighten-

Strictly speaking, what should matter for consumption and investment decisions is not the level or change
in this real yield but rather its distance to some time-varying equilibrium rate, the famous 𝑟 ∗ (see for example
Bailey et al., 2022). It is widely accepted that this has been falling for quite a while due to long-term factors
such as demographics (Vlieghe, 2021) but can also be affected by more medium-term headwinds.
Therefore, also measured real yields would have to fall over time just to stand still.

loosen policy boogie looks too much like fine-tuning to be good monetary policy. It is both
hard to communicate and to transmit through markets to the real economy.
To conclude, from the turning point assessment, I am looking for a significant and
sustained deceleration in higher frequency price increases and in the underlying inflation
measures and expectations towards inflation rates that are consistent with achieving the
2% target. Uncertainty around turning points should not motivate a wait-and-see approach,
as the consequences of under tightening far outweigh, in my opinion, the alternative. We
need to stay the course, and in my view the next step in Bank Rate is still more likely to be
another hike than a cut or hold.

7. Another turning point and central banks

I’ve been talking about turning points, but in light of one of the topics in focus at this
conference, I would like to highlight a turning or more appropriately a tipping point – that is
the tipping point on climate change. The Bank of England has been a leader in assessing
the implications of climate change for monetary policy - from former Governor
Mark Carney’s speech, ‘Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon’ (Carney, 2015), the Climate
Biennial Exploratory Scenario8, founding member of the NGFS, to implementing a
greening of the corporate bond portfolio.9
As more policymakers start to implement policies focused on reducing carbon emissions,
such as cap-and-trade, a carbon tax, or carbon border adjustment mechanisms, it is likely
that the volatility of inflation will increase, which puts climate policy directly in focus for the
price stability objective of central banks. I spoke briefly about this research at the recent
panel at the American Economic Association meetings in New Orleans. Stay tuned for an
upcoming speech to develop in more depth how the broader policy landscape to address
climate change has implications for monetary policy.
