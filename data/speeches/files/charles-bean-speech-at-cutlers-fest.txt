Master Cutler, Lord Lieutenant, High Sheriff, Lord Mayor, My Lords, Ladies and
Gentlemen.
I am very grateful to you, Master Cutler, for inviting me here to Sheffield to speak at
this great annual Feast, to meet the leaders of such an important sector of British
manufacturing industry, and to enjoy your magnificent hospitality.
We are now almost two years into the financial crisis, which broke in August 2007.
The preceding decade or so was marked by steady growth and low inflation, not just
in the United Kingdom but in many other parts of the world. In 2003, the Bank’s
Governor, Mervyn King, even went so far as to christen it the NICE decade –
standing for non-inflationary consistently expansionary. He was at pains to point out
that one should not expect that unusual stability to be maintained. But although we
subsequently fretted about the vulnerabilities building up within the global financial
system as a result of the relaxed attitude to risk and the easy availability of credit, we
never imagined quite how extreme the unwinding would prove, particularly after the
bankruptcy of Lehman's last September triggered a near collapse of the financial
system and a world-wide plunge in business and consumer confidence. The result has
been a sharp and synchronised contraction in economic activity across the globe and
an unprecedented collapse in world trade.
In the twelve months following the onset of the crisis, it seemed natural to expect
those countries where the build-up in debt had been greatest, such as the United States
and the United Kingdom, and those sectors that seemed most exposed, particularly
financial services and construction, to be the hardest hit. But that is not how it turned
out. The fall in UK GDP of nearly 3½% over the final quarter of last year and the
first quarter of 2009 represents the largest half-yearly decline since records began in
1955. But that is comparatively mild seen alongside falls of almost 6% in Germany
and nearly 8% in Japan, both countries running consistent current account surpluses.
Moreover, as most of you will be only too aware, the downturn has hit manufacturing
especially hard, with output in that sector down over 10% in the UK, 20% in
Germany and 30% in Japan, reflecting the sharp decline in the demand for consumer
durables and capital equipment that followed the loss in confidence and reduction in
the availability of credit. Rigorous inventory control then propagated the fall in
demand rapidly along globalised supply chains.

2

Now producers cannot run down inventories indefinitely, so the rate of contraction
should start to ease as de-stocking slows. And indeed, business surveys around the
world do suggest that the rate of contraction in activity has been moderating over the
past few months and that business confidence has started to improve. So the bottom
in economic activity may not be too far off.
Unfortunately these encouraging signs – I hesitate to identify them as “green shoots”
– do not tell us much about the strength and durability of the subsequent recovery.
Here there are reasons for both caution and optimism.
The main reason for caution lies in the nature of this downturn. Previous UK
recessions were associated with the need to reduce inflation after a period of excess
demand growth. But the period preceding the present crisis was not associated with
excessively rapid growth in the demand for goods and services. Instead, it was
characterised by excessive growth in the demand for financial and real assets, and in
the prices of those assets. All of that went into reverse after August 2007, with a sharp
reversal in perceptions of risk, falls in asset prices, a deterioration in banks’ balance
sheets, and a drying up of credit.
The Senior Warden, in his introduction, drew attention to the harm that the reduction
in the availability of credit is having on otherwise viable businesses in this part of the
country. We hear the same message repeatedly across the nation through the business
contacts of our network of regional Agents. The issue is very much at the forefront of
our concerns.
The UK Government has already introduced a range of measures to underpin the
banking system, including requiring the injection of additional capital, guaranteeing
bank debt and providing insurance against losses on some of the risky assets on
banks’ balance sheets. That has served to stabilise the banking system. But we are
still some way from having banks that feel sufficiently secure that they can lend
normally, and investors that have enough confidence in the banks to provide them
with sufficient funds. The Bank will continue to work alongside the Government and
the FSA in trying to ensure an adequate flow of funds to business. Unfortunately,
past experience in other countries suggests that it often takes time for the banking
system to mend after a crisis, and it is possible that the supply of credit will remain
impaired for some while.

There are two reasons for optimism about the strength of the recovery. First, we have
the advantage of a substantial depreciation in sterling, whose trade-weighted value is
about a quarter down on its value before the crisis broke. That should encourage
buyers to switch to goods and services made in this country and make it more
profitable to produce them. As a result, it should facilitate the necessary re-balancing
of the economy.
Second, an unprecedented policy stimulus is working its way through. In particular,
the Monetary Policy Committee has lowered Bank Rate to 0.5%, a level unmatched in
the Bank's 315-year history and only marginally above its floor of zero. But given the
strong contractionary tendencies in the economy, we decided that further stimulus was
needed. So in March, we announced a programme to purchase £75 bn of public and
private financial assets, financed by issuing extra Bank of England reserves – an
action going by the unlovely description of Quantitative Easing. And at our meeting
at the beginning of this month, we upped the total amount of purchases to £125 bn,
about half of which have so far been made.
The ultimate aim of these measures is to boost the annual rate of growth of nominal
spending in the economy, which has been roughly flat over the past year, to a level
consistent with a sustainable level and rate of growth of real activity and inflation
meeting our target.
Quantitative easing has been described in some quarters as “printing money”, though
it is not literally that. It is more akin to us buying the asset with a cheque drawn on
the Bank of England, which the seller then deposits with his own bank. As a
consequence, the quantity of bank deposits in the economy goes up, while the claims
that the banks hold on the Bank of England also increase.
The immediate impact of these purchases should be to drive up the price of the assets
that we are buying, or equivalently to reduce their yield. That is indeed what we have
seen, with gilt yields falling nearly ½ percentage point when the programme was
initiated. But that is not the end of the matter, as investors need to do something with
the proceeds from their asset sales. They could just sit on the proceeds, but it is more
likely that in due course they will buy other assets, including those that offer a higher
return. So, in the course of time, the whole range of equity and bond prices are driven
up, lowering the cost of finance to companies and increasing its availability.

Our purchases of corporate assets are intended to have the additional effect of
improving the functioning of those markets. By standing ready to buy commercial
paper and corporate bonds, we hope to improve their liquidity, lowering the spread
above safe assets of equivalent maturity, and with it the cost of finance to business.
There are signs that these measures are having a beneficial impact too. Spreads on
commercial paper eligible for purchase have fallen by around ½ percentage point and
the size of the market has increased by around 10%. Similarly, average spreads on
sterling investment grade corporate bonds for industrial companies have declined by
some 60 basis points and gross issuance of bonds by UK companies has been strong.
These developments may reflect a range of influences, but feedback from market
participants suggests that our purchases have indeed played a helpful role.
In addition to these channels, the banks, finding themselves flush with extra reserves,
may choose to lend them on, providing a further kick by boosting the supply of credit.
At the current juncture, however, a scarcity of funding and capital is likely to make
banks cautious about doing this. That was exactly what happened in Japan during its
so-called “lost decade”. But there are signs that the extra reserves may be
contributing to a decline in the interest rate that banks pay to borrow from each other.
It will take some time before we can assess just how effective Quantitative Easing has
proved to be. Our latest assessment is that the combined stimulus from policy easing
and the lower value of sterling should be sufficient to lead to growth resuming as we
move towards the end of the year. But the continuing drag from the financial sector
means that the ensuing pickup is likely to take place relatively slowly. There is,
however, considerable uncertainty surrounding that assessment.
Our primary objective is, of course, to control inflation, not growth. Our target
measure, the Consumer Price Index, has been running above the 2% target for the past
eighteen months, reflecting in particular the surge in energy and other commodity
prices during the first part of last year. But it is now dropping back, reflecting both
the sharp decline in energy prices in the latter part of 2008 and the growing margin of
spare capacity in the economy. We expect it soon to fall below target and it is more
likely than not to remain there for the next year or two. The inflation rate as measured
by the more familiar Retail Prices Index has fallen even more sharply, reflecting the

5

reduction in mortgage interest payments associated with the reduction in Bank Rate
and falling house prices.
When the recovery does come, as it surely will, the margin of spare capacity in the
economy will begin to shrink and inflationary pressures will start to build again. So at
some stage, we will have to begin withdrawing the large monetary stimulus.
Although this may be some way in the future, some market participants and
commentators are already starting to worry about whether we will be willing and able
to accomplish this sufficiently rapidly to prevent inflation taking off, particularly
given the scale of the Government’s prospective financing needs. Three points are
worth making.
First, the timing of the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus will be governed by the
need to meet the MPC’s inflation objective, not by the Government’s financing needs.
Second, with Bank Rate at its effective floor, we presently have only the asset
purchase programme as a tool to stimulate demand. But when it comes to tightening
policy, we have two instruments at our disposal: asset sales; and raising Bank Rate. It
is not necessary to unwind the asset purchases before raising Bank Rate.
Third, if we felt the need to drain the extra reserves from the system rapidly, we could
also do it by exchanging the reserves for short-term Bank of England bills, allowing
us to stagger the sales of the gilts.
Of course, the execution of our exit strategy will still present us with a tricky
judgement call. We do not want to nip a recovery in the bud prematurely. Equally we
will not want to let the inflation genie out of the bottle. But that is the sort of
balancing act that monetary policy makers regularly face, even if the scale of the
downturn and the size of the policy stimulus that has to be withdrawn are so much
larger now.
A previous guest at this Feast, Winston Churchill, declared that he “would rather see
finance less proud and industry more content”, shortly before he took the fateful
decision to return the pound to the gold standard at an overvalued rate. Finance has
certainly been humbled by the events of the past couple of years and the post-crisis
financial world is bound to look very different from the pre-crisis one. But let us also
hope that it is a world in which industry is more content.
