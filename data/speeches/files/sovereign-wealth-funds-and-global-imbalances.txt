Introduction

Much of the debate on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) has focused on political questions:
do they reintroduce the failings of public ownership into market economies by the back
door, will SWFs use their ownership rights to pursue political ends, and will resistance to
foreign ownership lead to a new wave of protectionism. I want to concentrate today on
some economic issues: why have they become so prominent recently, how does that
relate to imbalances in the world economy, how are they affecting financial markets and
what are the policy implications of their growth.

Background

But first let me set out some of the background.

There is no off the shelf definition of an SWF. What I have in mind is a government
investment vehicle that manages foreign assets with a higher risk tolerance and higher
expected returns than for central bank foreign currency reserves.1 The size of such funds
is hard to measure, but may be in the $2-3 trillion range.

Origins of SWFs

Investments by SWFs are one type of capital flow between countries so they have always
been closely related to global imbalances in trade. When countries run surpluses on their
current account, they generate equal and opposite net capital outflows of one sort or
another and those capital flows produce an investment income.

That has been the story of the UK economy over the last 150 years. We ran continuous
surpluses in the 50 years before the first world war (Chart 1) and built up a large stock of
1

There is some fuzziness at the edges of this definition. Central bank reserves in some countries, which
traditionally have been invested mainly in liquid and safe instruments, are increasingly being switched into
riskier assets. Also, in some countries, state-owned banks and companies invest in foreign assets where
some of the policy issues are the same as for sovereign wealth funds.

foreign assets. Partly as a result of that, we benefited from a surplus on our investment
account for most of the period since the 1870s.

There are two key differences between that period of the UK’s investment abroad and the
situation today. 100 years ago the developed countries were investing in emerging
markets (at the time in the Americas and Australia) which had abundant land and natural
resources but scarce capital and so the returns were high. Currently, capital is flowing
“uphill” from emerging to mature economies. Secondly, the investors before were mainly
in the private sector and were seeking out the best returns on capital. Today the investors
are mainly EME central banks and governments and the build up of foreign assets reflects
their policy choices.

Modern sovereign wealth funds are not new, in fact the first – the Kuwait Investment
Office – was set up here in London in February 1953 – just as Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay were setting out to climb Everest.3 And the number of funds has been
increasing since then like the traffic on the slopes of Everest.

The next wave were set up by other oil producers after the price increases in the 70s and
80s for persuasive reasons (Chart 2). First oil is a non-renewable resource so it can make
sense for governments to spread the benefits of this endowment across generations by
investing part of today’s income in assets that will provide an income tomorrow. That
would be so even if the path of oil prices was predictable but in fact it is not. That
uncertainty about future income provides a second case for saving today. In the late
1970s, some oil exporters increased spending to match higher incomes and faced a
painful adjustment when prices fell back again. Third, even if the rise in income was
permanent there would be a case for phasing the growth of domestic spending and
investment to prevent supply bottlenecks leading to inflation.

The Kuwait Investment Office is the in-house investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority
(formerly known as the Kuwait Investment Board) and was established by Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem AlSabah on 23 February 1953. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit on 29 May 1953.

Recent growth of SWFs

Since the millennium at least 10 new SWFs have been set up and there are reports of
plans for more for example in Brazil, Japan and India.

This reflects the remarkable shift of emerging-market economies from debtors to
creditors. Ten years ago – at the time of the Asian crisis – emerging markets as a whole
were running a current account deficit. Since then they have been running progressively
bigger current account surpluses reaching an estimated $685 billion last year (1.3 % of
world GDP).4 The counterpart to this is that developed countries as a group have been
running progressively bigger current account deficits not just in the United States but also
in a number of other developed countries including the UK.5 Of course there are some
notable exceptions in each group: Canada, Japan and Germany for example are still
creditors while many countries in central and eastern Europe and Africa are running large
deficits. But maps 1 and 2 show how much the pattern has changed in the last 10 years.
Most of South America and South East Asia have swung from deficit to surplus. Perhaps
as important, the scale of the differences has grown with more countries running
surpluses or deficits of over 5% of GDP.

Oil and other commodity inflation is part of the story, of course, but that does not account
for the large current surpluses in most of East Asia. In China strong manufacturing
growth resulting from higher labour productivity has not been matched by higher
domestic spending so savings have grown ahead of even dramatic investment growth. A
deliberate policy of fostering export industrial growth has slowed the rise of exchange
rates that would reduce these imbalances.

4

These figures include the NICs. Excluding NICs the estimated surplus is $596 billion (1.1%).

5
Latest data show that current account deficits were 5% of GDP or above not only in the United States but
also in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Iceland.

As a result the build-up in EME foreign assets have been held mainly as central bank
reserves especially in Asian countries (Chart 3). In total the foreign assets now held by
EME central banks and governments is about $7 trillion dollars, which compares with
only $60 billion gross foreign assets held by the UK government. Many emerging
economies concluded after the Asian crisis a decade ago that they needed bigger liquid
reserves in traditional government debt to defend themselves against volatility in
financial markets even when that carried the likelihood of a negative return (taking
account of expected exchange rate movements). But when the reserves outstripped the
levels needed for that purpose, it was natural to look to increase the returns on investment
by widening the range of investments.6

And in the next few years, these current account surpluses are likely to remain high and
the build up of foreign assets by governments in oil exporting and Asian countries is
likely to continue. According to the IMF’s forecasts, the combined current account
surplus of China and oil-exporting countries will be around $800 billion over the next 3
years. And the IMF estimates that sovereign wealth fund assets could grow to $6-10
trillion within the next 5 years.

The impact of SWFs on financial markets

These are huge numbers and SWFs have become prominent and important players in
many financial markets. But we should not exaggerate their impact on the global
financial system. In aggregate, their assets under management are currently only less than
one-twentieth of those held by private sector participants such as pension, insurance and
mutual funds as well as hedge funds and private equity (Chart 4). And they account for
about 2% of the total size of equity and bond markets globally. Even in five years time –
and on some of the fastest growth projections – assets under management by sovereign
wealth funds are projected to reach only about 6% of global financial assets.7 Moreover,
6

Foreign reserves held by EME central banks as a whole are about 60% (close to $3 trillion) higher than
needed for conventional precautionary reasons to cover short-term external debt.

though they have more assets under management than hedge funds they have smaller
investments since they are not leveraged.8

It is not difficult to identify positive effects on the world’s capital markets. Sovereign
wealth funds have long investment horizons and generally have no commercial liabilities.
Therefore, in periods of market stress they are likely to face less pressure than most
private investors to reduce the size or increase the liquidity of their investments. They are
well placed to play a contrarian role and help to stabilise markets by investing in times of
stress. For example, when the global equity market fell sharply between 2000 and 2002,
the Norwegian Government Pension Fund was a large buyer of global equities. And a
number of sovereign wealth funds have played an important and welcome stabilising role
during the current turmoil by providing around $40 billion of new capital since
November to some of the world’s biggest commercial and investment banks (Table 1).9

Taking a broader view, the switch of some reserves from government debt into SWFs
which invest in a wider range of instruments should help to improve the allocation of
resources if these investments are based on commercial criteria. Investing in equities may
also help to reinforce and bring to the surface the common interest that EMEs and the
advanced economies have in the good performance of the companies involved and the
markets they operate in. It may thus help to integrate EMEs into the global financial
system and encourage them to participate more in global policy making.

From a parochial point of view, the prospective increase in demand for equities relative
to bonds could have a positive impact on London and sterling. Whereas the value of the
UK market for public debt securities is only 3.3% of the global market, UK equities
account for 7½% of the value of global equities. The rapid growth in sovereign wealth
funds is also a fillip for London as a leading international financial centre.
8

That said, the assets held by sovereign wealth funds are highly concentrated, with around 70% of total
assets held by the five largest funds. So the largest sovereign wealth funds could have an impact on some
markets especially smaller ones such as other EMEs.
9

Also, a number of central banks from countries with large current account surpluses have been willing
throughout the current liquidity crisis to lend to international banks, including UK ones, at longer, three-totwelve month, maturities.

SWFs and transparency

The main doubts concern their objectives and how far their investments will be driven
only by financial returns.

Public sector owners might have other objectives including national political interests,
such as, accessing military technology, controlling strategic resources or markets, and
influencing public opinion.10 There are often complaints that sovereign wealth funds lack
transparency. Decoded, this is a request for reassurance about their investment policies.

I am certainly not going to argue against more transparency (except in the very special
case of the market operations of central banks). More openness from SWFs may help to
alleviate concerns in recipient countries – and thus reduce protectionist pressures. And it
may improve the dissemination of information to market participants and to their own
citizens. I know many SWFs are working with the IMF to produce a voluntary code of
conduct that is based on best practices for the governance and transparency of sovereign
wealth funds. For example, it would be helpful if all sovereign wealth funds were
transparent about their overall strategies, objectives and broad investment guidelines.
Norway’s Government Pension Fund is a good example in this respect.

But there should be a level playing field applied to all investors. The case for greater
transparency applies to other investors too. SWFs may take some comfort that they are
not being singled out and that there are equally powerful pressures for transparency on
hedge funds and private equity investors. In this respect, two recent initiatives are
particularly welcome. First, a report under the chairmanship of Sir Andrew Large – my
predecessor as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank – on voluntary
standards, including on disclosure, for hedge funds. And, second, a report by Sir David

Note though that this distinction between foreign public and private sector owners is not cut and dried.
Foreign private sector purchases of football teams or newspapers do not always seem to be driven by the
profit motive.

Walker – a former Executive Director of the Bank – on guidelines for disclosure and
transparency by private equity funds.11

And transparency should not be one sided among countries. I know SWFs themselves
are often keen for more transparency from recipient countries on whether and how far
they are welcome and the rules of engagement.

The UK in recent years has been unusually open to foreign investors and foreign
ownership both in comparison to our past and in comparison to most other developed
(and emerging) countries today. We have relied on regulation of infrastructure industries
and on competition law to prevent the abuse of market power and most of our utilities,
much of the financial sector, as well as an increasing number of our leading football clubs
have come into foreign ownership. In its latest survey of international direct investment
trends, the OECD ranked the UK as having one of the least restrictive regulatory
environment for foreign direct investment across all OECD member countries (Chart 5).
And the UK has welcomed a number of SWFs to London as a base for international
operations.

Sovereign wealth funds and global imbalances

However, the emphasis on transparency and the politics of SWFs risks missing a bigger
policy issue: the recent rapid growth in SWFs reflects large and persistent global
imbalances which are a continuing threat to the stability of the world financial system and
the global economy.

11

Hedge Fund Working Group (2008), "Hedge Fund Standards: Final Report" and Walker Working Group
(2007), "Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity". The Large Report recommends a
set of best practice standards for hedge funds in terms of disclosure, valuation, risk, governance and
shareholder conduct. The Walker Report recommends a set of guidelines for disclosure and transparency by
private equity funds, including the publication of regular information on their financing, ownership and
prospects.

Global imbalances and financial crises

While there are many examples of countries which have run deficits for many years such
as Australia and New Zealand, history also shows how painful the eventual adjustment
can be. There are many examples in which capital flight has resulted in a huge fall in
GDP growth and broader financial crises – for example in Latin America in the early
1980s, in the Nordic countries in the early 1990s and the east Asian economies a decade
ago – which, in turn, weakened global GDP growth or global financial institutions.

Countries with large deficits are vulnerable to a rapid reversal of capital flows. If
investors are no longer willing to finance the deficit, domestic spending will need to be
cut relative to output through a combination of reducing spending and switching
production to the tradable sector. A recent IMF study reviewed 42 episodes of large
reductions in current account deficits in developed countries over the past 40 years. In a
quarter of the cases, which were mainly countries with limited real exchange rate
depreciation, annual GDP growth fell by 3½ percentage points on average.12

There are dangers too for surplus countries. Large foreign exchange inflows are not easy
to sterilise. They tend to contribute to asset price bubbles and higher inflation which
itself can undermine economic and financial stability. The effect of such inflows into
China and oil-exporting countries have been compounded recently by their exchange
rates being pegged or managed against the falling dollar. This has contributed not just to
the build up of reserves and SWFs but also to the build up of inflationary pressures within
these countries.

No one would blame EMEs for the current turmoil in Western financial markets. It has
been generated at home by the widespread mispricing of financial assets; this has been
most obvious among the assets based on the US housing market but it is not confined to
that sector. However the way that the boom developed did owe a great deal to global
imbalances.

The “savings glut”, to quote Ben Bernanke13, that developed in the oil exporting
countries and China contributed to the fall in real long-term interest rates.14 In the UK,
for example, real long-term interest rates, measured by the difference between the
nominal 10-year government bond yield and the annual rate of inflation, fell from around
3.9% in 1997 to 1.6% in 2005. A similar pattern was also evident in the US (Chart 6). In
particular, interest rates on safe assets fell since the build up in foreign assets were
invested mainly in government bonds.15 That both discouraged saving and boosted asset
prices. In order to maintain their traditional returns, the private sector sought higher
yielding strategies and were too ready to believe that these could be attained through new
products without running bigger risks. We are now dealing with the consequences of that
mistake.

Global imbalances – where to from here
The unwinding of global imbalances requires some combination of a slowdown in the
growth of domestic demand in deficit countries and an increase in domestic demand in
surplus countries. If the slowdown is not to dominate, we need to see a shift in relative
prices to rebalance demand – that is a gradual real exchange rate depreciation of deficit
countries against surplus ones.

The rise of SWFs may play a part in this dynamic. Their emergence is a sign that surplus
countries may be less willing in future to accept such low yielding assets. That should
put pressure on exchange rates to adjust and contribute to a reduction in global

Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, and Bernanke, B (2005) "The Global Savings Glut and the U.S. Current
Account Deficit", speech delivered for the Sandridge Lecture at the Virginia Association of Economists.

14

A fall in desired investment (investment ‘strike’) in some countries also contributed to the decline in
global real interest rates. For example, investment-GDP ratios fell sharply in the Newly Industrialised
Countries in the wake of the east Asian crisis a decade ago.

15

For example FE Warnock and VC Warnock (2006) (‘International Capital Flows and US interest rates’,
NBER Working Paper, 12560) estimate that foreign official flows reduced US 10-year Treasury nominal
yields by about 100 basis points lower than otherwise in the year to June 2005.

imbalances. So while SWFs may be a product of global imbalances, they may also play a
part in the adjustment.

There are signs that in the United States, at least, imbalances are beginning to adjust. The
US current account deficit now looks past its peak and the marked fall in the dollar –
about 25% in real traded-weighted terms – since its peak in early 2002 should help in the
adjustment. However, the decline in US relative demand is coming about mainly through
slower domestic demand growth at home rather than faster demand growth abroad while
the dollar has fallen less against currencies with the largest current account surpluses
(Chart 7). There is a risk, therefore, that the fall in the US current deficit will not be
matched by a fall of surpluses in high surplus countries but a rise in deficits in other
deficit countries. The imbalances could be transferred not reduced.

So it is important that the current large gap between savings and investment in the Far
East and oil exporting countries narrows. In the near term, the ability to increase spending
will be constrained by the recent increase in inflationary pressures in these countries.
But more exchange rate flexibility should be helpful on both fronts. And over the
medium-term, in oil exporting countries, government spending is likely to increase
further in response to past increases in incomes since part of the rise in the oil price looks
to be permanent. This gives oil exporters the opportunity to spend more on diversifying
production in their economies. It is encouraging also that in China the government has
plans to increase its own expenditure on the infrastructure, encourage higher spending by
households through speeding up financial sector reform and improving the safety net as
well as allowing more flexibility than in the past in the exchange rate.

Conclusion

Given the growth of the foreign currency reserves in many EMEs, the emergence of
SWFs making long term investments on financial criteria in a wider range of
instruments is a positive development. Some increase in the transparency both of the
strategy and objectives of the funds and of recipient countries’ approach to inward

investment should help dispel concerns and ensure they are a force for greater global
financial integration rather than a prompt for a new wave of financial protectionism.
SWF’s recent investments in global financial institutions have been helpful in easing the
current financial market turmoil. And the fact that they, and their central banks, are
looking for higher returns and greater asset diversification should be beneficial both to
the EMEs and to the recipient countries since it should improve the efficiency of global
asset allocation.

But that positive story should not conceal that the growth of SWFs is also a result of
persistent global imbalances in trade. These imbalances have helped create
vulnerabilities in financial markets and in the wider economy. Our current experience is
one more illustration of how painful the unwinding of such imbalances can be.
