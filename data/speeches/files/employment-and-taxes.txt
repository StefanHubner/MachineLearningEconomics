1. Introduction
One of the most interesting features of the developed world is the fact that people in
some countries work much harder than in others. By work, we mean work in the
market, not work overall, which is an important distinction. For example, US and
German households spend around the same proportion of their income on “food and
beverages”. However, in the US, around a half of this goes to restaurants, compared
with only one quarter in Germany. Far more time in the latter country is spent on
food preparation at home (see Freeman and Schettkat, 2001). Despite this, in what
follows we focus on market work, where the differences across countries are startling.
For example, the average person of working age (16-64) works around 46 per cent
more in the United States than in Belgium (see Table 1). A little over half of his
difference is because more people in the US are in employment with the remaining
difference arising from the fact that those in employment in the US tend to work more
hours per year. These substantial differences explain the majority of the variation in
GDP per capita among the advanced countries of the OECD, with differences in
productivity making a significantly smaller contribution.
When confronted with these differences, it is natural to look at the incentives to
engage in market work relative to other activities in the different countries. The
particular feature of these incentives on which we shall focus are those embedded in
the tax system. To be more precise, we shall concentrate on taxes on employment
paid by firms (payroll taxes), taxes on income paid by individuals and taxes on
consumption paid by individuals. Important features of the overall incentive structure
which we shall not discuss in detail include the unemployment benefit system, the
sickness and disability benefit system and the early retirement benefit system. These
are obviously an important part of the overall picture given that those in the
population of working age who do not work fall into five major categories, namely
full-time students, the unemployed, the sick and disabled, the early retired and those
looking after their family.
In what follows, we look briefly at the theoretical background in the next section.
Then in Section 3 we present an array of results on taxes, wages and employment and

2
in Section 4 we consider non-employment among different sub-groups of the
population of working age. We finish with a summary and some general conclusions.
2. Theoretical Background
A great deal has been written on taxation and employment and useful summaries are
provided by Pissarides (1998) or Koskela (2002). The basic model looks something
like the following.

Using a representative agent model, with the population of

working age normalised to unity, we may define h as (market) work and then (1-h) is
non-work. Let output y be generated by the production function:
y = Bk 1-a h a

(1)

where k is capital. Representative utility is given by

u = ln c + q ln (1 - h )

(2)

where c is consumption. Suppose W is nominal labour cost per employee and P is the
price of the firm’s output. So w = W P is the real labour cost per employee facing the
firm. Then suppose we have proportional tax rates as follows. The payroll tax rate is
t1 , the income tax rate is t 2 , the consumption tax rate is t 3 . Then the real post-tax
consumption wage is given by
W (1 - t1 )(1 - t 2 )
= w(1 - t ) say.
P(1 + t 3 )

(3)

So t is the “tax wedge” between the real labour cost per employee facing the firm and
the real post-tax consumption wage. Note that t is given by
t = 1-

(1 - t1 )(1 - t 2 )
1 + t3

≃ (t1 + t 2 + t 3 )

(4)

In equilibrium, the marginal product of labour is equal to real labour cost per
employee and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure is
equal to the real post-tax consumption wage. Thus we have

a y h=w

(5)

1
q
= w(1 - t )
(1 - h ) c

(6)

Eliminating w yields

3

(1 - t )
(q c / ay ) + (1 - t )

h=

(7)

which is diminishing in t 1 . The size of the impact of t depends crucially on q .
Prescott (2002) calibrates this equation and uses it to generate predicted labour supply
for seven OECD countries and finds that it matches actual labour supply quite closely.
How his results square with others in this area is discussed in the next section.
It might, however, be argued that in Europe, some sort of bargaining model of wage
determination would be more realistic. Suppose we have identical firms, labelled i,
and that wages are determined by a Nash bargain which maximises

[h (w ) (w (1 - t ) + y
i

i

]

b

g

i

n

- A) P i

(8)

where y n is real, post-tax, per capita non-labour income, A is expected alternative
income if not employed in firm i and P is the firm’s profit.

The parameter

g measures the extent to which the worker takes account of the employment effects of

the wage bargain. Purely individualistic bargaining would be associated with low
levels of g , collective bargaining with high levels. The b parameter captures the
relative strength of the worker in the bargain.
Expected alternative income A consists of two elements, that generated by
employment in another firm with income w(1 -t ) + y n , probability h , and that
generated by non-employment with income bw(1 -t ) + y n + z , probability (1 - h ) . b
represents non-employment benefit relative to post-tax employment income, z
captures the real value of the leisure when not employed. So A is given by
A = h(w(1 - t ) + y n ) + (1 - h )(bw(1 - t ) + y n + z )

(9)

If (8) is maximised with respect to wi and noting that the production function (1)
ensures that

¶ln h i / ¶ln w i = -(1 - a ) , w i h i / P i = a / (1 - a ) , the first order
-1

condition implies that
wi (1 - t )
bl + a
=
(wi (1 - t ) + y n - A) b (1 - a )

(10)

4

Noting that identical firms implies that wi = w , and using (9), (10) becomes

(1 - h )(1 - b - z ) = b (1 - a ) / (bg + a )

(11)

where z = z w(1 - t ) . So, in this context, the only reason why taxes impact on
employment is because the value of leisure enters “income” while not working and is
unaffected by a change in the tax wedge. Non-labour income plays no role essentially
because in this model, only the difference between income when employed and when
not employed is relevant and non-labour income is eliminated.

Suppose we define potential output, y , by
y = AK 1-a ,

(12)

that is the output if the whole population works. Then
z = z / w(1 - z ) = zh1-a / a y (1 - t ) and (11) becomes

(1 - h(1 - b - (z / a y )h

1-a

))

/ (1 - t =

b (1 - a )
bg + a

(13)

which implies ¶h / ¶t < 0 so long as benefits and the value of leisure are less than the
post-tax wage. Of course, if this were not the case, no one would work.
In these models, market work depends only on the total tax wedge, t . There are a
number of reasons why the impact of the different tax elements of t on market work
may differ. First, in the above model, suppose the utility of income is not linear.
Then non-labour income is not eliminated. Since non-labour income is typically not
subject to payroll taxes, then the impact of the payroll tax rate on work may differ
form that of the income tax or consumption tax rate (see Hoon and Phelps, 1995 for
example). Second, suppose there is a wage floor, because of minimum wage laws, for
example. Then, for those at or near the wage floor, a switch from income taxes to
payroll taxes will reduce employment. Third, the fact that the tax base for the three
different taxes generally differs ensures that switches between them will not be
neutral.
Another feature of these models is that the taxes are all proportional. Income taxes
are often progressive and the degree of progressivity may, itself, have an independent

5
impact. For example, in a bargaining model, increased progressivity leads to lower
wage demands because wage increases are less valuable and this generates more
work. The standard labour supply effect, however, typically goes in the other
direction.
To summarise, therefore, there are good theoretical reasons why the total tax wedge
may have a negative impact on work and why the individual tax rates which make up
the total wedge may have differing effects. The size of these potential effects is
obviously an empirical matter, so this is the topic of the next section.
3. Tax Effects on Work and Pay
We start by looking at the general size of the tax wedge In the OECD countries over
the years (see Table 2). All countries exhibit a substantial increase over the period
from the 1960s to the 1990s although there are wide variations across countries.
These mainly reflect the extent to which health, higher education and pensions are
publicly provided along with the all-round generosity of the social security system.
Some countries have made significant attempts to reduce labour taxes in recent years,
notably the Netherlands and the UK. Underlying these numbers are some significant
variations in the individual tax rate, notably Denmark and Australia have tiny payroll
tax rates whereas as those in Italy and France are very substantial, being around 40
per cent.
Turning to the evidence, this comes typically in two forms. The first is the impact of
taxes on labour costs per employee facing firms, the second focuses directly on the
effect of taxes on aspects of labour input. The former is relevant because in order for
taxes to reduce work, they must raise labour costs per employee so that firms reduce
their demand for labour. If tax increases leave labour costs per employee unchanged,
then they are all shifted onto labour and employment is unaffected. In the remainder
of this section, we first consider whether different taxes have different effects. Then
we look at the impact of the tax wedge on real labour costs per employee and finally
the impact of the tax wedge on aggregate labour input.

6
Different Tax Effects
The key issue here is whether different taxes exhibit differential rates of shifting onto
labour. There are a large number of time series wage equations for various countries
which show different degrees of shifting onto labour for different taxes. There is no
pattern to these numbers2, many of which are summarised in Layard et al. (1991)
p.210, OECD (1994), p.247, Disney (2000), and Koskela (2002). Some intensive
cross-country investigations may be found in the work of Tyrväinen reported in
OECD (1994), Table 9.5 and in that of Robertson and Symons in OECD (1990),
Annex 6A. In both these wide-ranging studies, there is no significant evidence that
payroll, income or consumption taxes have a differential impact on labour costs and
hence on unemployment. As the OECD Jobs Study (1994) remarks, “Changes in the
mix of taxes by which governments raise revenues can be expected, at most, to have a
limited effect on unemployment” (p. 275).
Tax Wedge Effects on Real Labour Cost per Employee
In OECD (1990), Annex 6, a simple test of the impact of tax rates on labour costs is
carried out as follows. We have labour demand and labour supply equations of the
form
N D = f 1 (w)K , N S = f

2

(w - T , z )L

where N = employment, w = In (real labour cost), K = capital stock, T = (t1+t2+t3), the
total tax rate, L = the labour force, z = exogenous factors. Then the reduced form
wage equation is
w = g(T,K/L,z).
If w is independent of T in the long run, the labour market behaves as if labour supply
is inelastic and taxes are all shifted onto labour.

Employment, and hence

unemployment is then unaffected by T in the long run. The following equation
represents the average coefficients and t statistics for individual time series
regressions on 16 OECD countries (1955-86).
w = 0.79w-1 + 0.181n( K / L) - 0.08T + 0.52DT .

7
Thus total taxes, T, have no long-run effects on labour costs although they have a
substantial and long-lasting short-run effect via DT (and the high level of persistence
in wages). Consistent with this result is the work discussed in Gruber (1997) on the
incidence of payroll taxation. Gruber studies the impact on wages and employment at
the micro level of the sharp exogenous reduction in payroll tax rates (of around 25
percentage points!) which took place in Chile over the period 1979-86. His analysis
of a large number of individual firms indicates that wages adjust completely to this
payroll tax shift and there is no employment effect whatever.
In contrast to this result, two multi-country studies find significant tax wedge effects
on labour costs. Daveri and Tabellini (2000) find that a 10 percentage point increase
in the tax wedge raises real labour costs by 5 per cent in the long run for a select
group of countries3, although there are few controls for other labour market
institutions (see Table 11, col. 1). Nickell et al. (2003) report an equivalent figure of
3.7 per cent controlling for a complete set of labour market institutions (see Table 12.
col.1). Many others have found significant tax wedge effects on labour costs, and
some have argued that the size of these tax wedge effects depends significantly on
those labour market institutions connected with flexibility (see Liebfritz et al., 1997
and Daveri and Tabellini, 1997). In order to pursue this, we set out some results on
the impact of the tax wedge on labour costs in Table 3. The first point to note is how
wildly the numbers and the rankings fluctuate across the columns. This is basically
due to variations in the other variables included in the labour cost equations and
emphasises the fragility of most of the results in this area. Second, in order to see if
there is any relationship between tax wedge effects and labour market flexibility we
regressed the average tax wedge effect on some institutional variables to obtain:
Tax wedge effect = Constant + 0.030 employment protection
(0.9)
- 0.005 labour standards
(0.1)
- 0.16 co-ordination (union + employer)
- (1.7)
+ 0.004 union density (average)
(0.6)
N = 20, R2 = 0.23.
While most of the signs are consistent with the hypothesis, the negative impact of
wage bargaining co-ordination is the only one which is significant (at the 10 per cent

8
level). So the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that flexibility reduces tax wedge
effects is not strong. Overall, however, the balance of the evidence suggests that there
is probably some overall adverse tax effect on real labour costs per employee. The
possible consequences for the impact on employment we report in the next section.
Tax Wedge Effects on Employment
An array of results in this area is presented in Table 4.

While there is some

variability, overall they tell a reasonably consistent story. If we omit the outliers on
the high side (Prescott, 2002; Daveri and Tabellini, 2000) on the grounds that they
exclude important control variables, we find that a 10 percentage point rise in the tax
wedge reduces labour input by somewhere between 1 and 3 per cent of the population
of working age. Taking an average point estimate as 2 per cent, this is a relatively
small but by no means insignificant effect. For example, the average rise in the tax
wedge in the advanced OECD countries from the early 1960s to the late 1990s is
around 15 percentage points, worth a reduction in labour input of around 3 per cent of
the population of working age4. Comparing the big three countries of continental
Europe (France, Germany and Italy) with the United States, the difference in the tax
wedge (around 16 percentage points) would explain around 3.2 percentage points of
the difference in total labour input which is around one quarter of the overall
difference in the employment rate. The remainder would be down to other factors
including, in particular, the substantial differences in the social security systems, as
well as other labour market institutions. In the next section we pursue these issues a
little further by looking more closely at the labour input rates for different groups in
the working age population.
4. Labour Inputs Across Different Groups
The overall picture for OECD countries is presented in Tables 5 and 6. We ignore
inactivity rates among the young because these are strongly influenced by the extent
of post-school education among the young and whether or not post-school education
takes place mainly with educational institutions, as in the US, or in firms, as in
Germany.

9
Focussing first on prime age men (age 25-54), we see that even among this group, in
most countries more are inactive than are unemployed. Furthermore, the inactivity
rate in this group is higher in the US than in the European Union. Interestingly, most
inactive men in this age group are classified as sick or disabled, the majority of whom
are claiming some form of state benefit. Furthermore, the size of this disability group
has risen substantially since the 1970s in nearly every country, and in those which
have been analysed, this increase has been driven by changes in the entry rules and
the available benefits (see Bound and Burkhauser, 1999, for some detailed evidence).
Among older men, unemployment rates are generally much the same as for prime age
men, but inactivity rates are enormously larger and vary dramatically from one
country to another. In some European countries, more than half the older men are
inactive, whereas in Norway and Sweden, the inactivity rate is closer to one quarter.
As Blondal and Scarpetta (1998) note, these large cross-country variations were not
apparent as recently as 1971, when nearly all the countries had inactivity rates for this
group below 20 per cent, the major exception being Italy with a rate of 41 per cent,
(see Blondal and Scarpetta, 1998, Table V.1, p.72). The main factor explaining the
current variations and the consequent large changes since 1971 has been the structure
of the social security system. Incentives for men to stay in the labour force vary
widely, with generous incentives to retire early being introduced in many countries.
This was often done in order to reduce labour supply in the mistaken view that this
would help to resolve the problem of unemployment. As a consequence, Belgium,
France, Germany and Italy, for example, all have exceptionally high inactivity rates
among older men on top of their exceptionally high unemployment rates.
Inactivity rates among women aged 25 to 54 also vary widely, with the Scandinavian
countries having the lowest rates in the OECD, and Italy and Spain having the
highest. While the majority of inactive women in this age group report themselves as
looking after their family, Italy and Spain in fact have the lowest fertility rates in the
OECD. What is important here is the structure of the tax system, particularly the
marginal tax rate facing wives when their husbands work, the existence of barriers to
part-time work, and the availability of publicly funded child care. A key tax issue
which is relevant here is whether husbands and wives are taxed jointly or separately
(see OECD, 1990, Table 6.3.)

10
Finally, it is worth noting how unemployment in Italy, Spain and to a lesser extent
France is heavily concentrated among young people and women. This is partly due to
the role of employment protection laws in generating barriers to employment for new
entrants and partly due to the social mores surrounding entry into work. For example,
in Italy many young people, particularly if they are well qualified, will live at home
for many years without working but effectively queuing for a particularly desirable
job and contributing to measured unemployment (although perhaps not to true
unemployment).
To summarise, looking at different sub-groups of the working age population, the
numbers suggest that many factors other than standard tax rates are important in
determining the extent of non-employment. This is consistent with the overall
conclusion of the previous section that tax rates explain only a fraction, albeit a
significant one, of the cross-country differences in employment rates (see also Bertola
et al. 2002 where the results have similar implications).
5. Summary and Conclusions
Our basic conclusion is that tax rates are a significant factor in explaining differences
in the amount of market work undertaken by the working age population in different
countries. However, the evidence suggests that tax rate differentials only explain a
minority of the market work differentials, the majority being explained by other
relevant labour market institutions. Particularly important are probably the
differences in social security systems which provide income support to various nonworking groups including the unemployed, the sick and disabled, and the early
retired.

OECD National Accounts as follows:
(i)

Payroll tax rate = EC/(IE-EC),EC=EPP+ESS.EPP = employers’ private pensions and welfare
plans contributions, ESS = employers’ social security contributions, IE = compensations of
employees.
Income tax rate = (WC+IT)/HCR. WC = employees’ social security contributions, IT = income
taxes, HCR = households’ current receipts.
Consumption tax rate = (TX-SB)/CC. TX = indirect taxes, SB = subsidies, CC = private final
consumption expenditure. The inclusion of EPP in the payroll tax rate may be subject to
debate. Excluding this term has little impact on the broad overall pattern of the numbers.

Notes:
a)
An impact of x hours on average weekly working hours is equivalent to 2.5x percentage
points (pps) taking a full work week as 40 hours.
b)
Prescott computes the tax wedge and predicted hours for seven countries. For each country

(

)

we compute (predicted hours - predictedhours ) ¸ taxwedge - taxwedge where the
means are across the countries. The computed impact is the average of this ratio across the
seven countries. It is also worth noting that Prescott approximates a measure of the marginal
tax wedge by multiplying the income tax rate by 1.6 in all countries. In practice this makes
little difference to the overall cross-country pattern of the tax wedge.

Note: These data do not include those in prison. This makes little odds except in the US where counting those in prison would raise the inactivity rate among prime age
men by around 2 percentage points.

Endnotes

1. Of course (7) is not the end of the story, because c/y is endogenous. Typically,
however, this ratio is determined by factors other than the tax wedge. For
example, if there is no capital and all government expenditure is provided to the
population in the form of consumption, then c/y=1 whatever the level of taxes and
government expenditure.
2. The problem in single country time series investigations is discriminating between
permanent effects and temporary effects which persist for a long time.
3. Namely Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, UK (pre1980).
4. In fact the average employment/population ratio in these same countries has risen
over the same period, so there are obviously other forces at work aside from taxes.
This overall change is because the rise in the employment/population ratio among
women has more than offset the fall among men.
