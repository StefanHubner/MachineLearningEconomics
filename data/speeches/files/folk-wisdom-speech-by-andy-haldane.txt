I am delighted to be here to celebrate the 100 anniversary of the founding of the Bank of Estonia. It is a
particular privilege to be giving this lecture in the Bank’s “Independence Hall” – the very spot where, on
24 February 1918, Estonia’s Provisional Government was formed. The founding of the Bank of Estonia
followed on the Republic’s first birthday in 1919.

Reaching your first century is a true milestone for any person or institution. In the UK, when you reach your
th

100 birthday you receive a signed card of congratulations from the Queen. I am afraid I have no royal
birthday card for you today. But I have the next best thing – another speech from another central banker.

Times are tough in central banking. Central banks have borne much of the burden of supporting the global
economy as it has recovered from the global financial crisis. In some advanced economies, such as the UK
and US where the output gap has largely been closed, that extraordinary monetary support is now being
gradually withdrawn. In others, such as the euro area, a gradual withdrawal has been clearly signposted.

The gradual withdrawal of exceptional monetary stimulus is unlikely by itself, however, to remove entirely the
weight from central banks’ shoulders. Many have acquired new powers and new responsibilities since the
crisis, particularly in the regulatory sphere. At the same time, the crisis has dented trust in the financial
sector, including in central banks. In combination that has raised expectations, but also some doubts, about
the role of central banks in serving society.

1

Central banks have, over the course of the recent past, undergone a revolution in their degree of
transparency and accountability. This has delivered huge gains. By improving public understanding, it has
helped stabilise the economy and the financial system. And by improving public accountability, it has allayed
concerns about central banks being over-powerful and under-accountable to the societies they serve.

But time has moved thing on and, as in the past, central banks will need to move with the times. In response
to greater levels of responsibility, but more fragile trust, I will argue a second revolution in central bank
practices may be needed. This would need to be every bit as radical as the first, but would require central
banks to engage with, and draw on, the general public – their “folk wisdom” – as never before.

Central banks were put on earth to serve the public. The second revolution is about putting the public more
firmly into public institutions. At a time of raised expectations and lowered trust, a reinforcement of central
banks’ social contract with society could make them even more effective in the period ahead, whether you
are the Bank of England (into its fourth century) or the Bank of Estonia (commencing its second).

Let me start by saying a word about the central bank revolution of the recent past, before turning to the
present and the future and the challenges and changes that may lie ahead in engaging the general public.
The Bank of England has already begun taking important steps towards increasing its engagement. Some

of the steps taken by central banks may have relevance to other public institutions, many of which face
similar challenges of raised expectations and diminished trust among the general public.

A Central Bank Revolution
You do not typically associate central banks with revolution, unless the “r” is silent. Yet I do not think it is an
exaggeration to say that, over the course of recent decades, a revolution has swept through pretty much
every central bank on the planet. That revolution has come in the area of external communications,
openness and accountability.

It came neither quickly nor easily. It was only a generation ago that, when asked by Mervyn King for a
one-word piece of advice, Paul Volcker replied “mystique”. To that point, opacity rather than transparency
coursed through central bankers’ veins. That bloodline ran from Montagu Norman a century ago (“never
explain, never apologise”) through to Alan Greenspan a generation ago (“I’ve learned to mumble with great
incoherence”).

Historically, the case for central bank secrecy was deeply rooted. It rested in part on custom and practice, in
part on theology. Central banks historically were rarely subject to external scrutiny, at least by the general
public. And central bankers were generally perceived as the high priests of finance. It was said that central
bankers, like faith, were better understood by their deeds than by their words.

2

That was just as well because central bankers rarely uttered any words at all. A century ago, public
utterances by the Governor of the Bank of England amounted to one after-dinner speech each year to a
well-watered set of City of London bankers. Heroically, attempts were made by some academics to
rationalise this monetary mystique as a necessary means of central banks exerting influence over the
economy.

3

Times have changed. The central bank secrecy doctrine has been over-turned, in part for conceptual
reasons, in part for practical ones. Within academia, economic theorists began constructing models where
policy credibility was absolutely central if people’s expectations were to remain anchored and the economy
4

kept stable. Establishing credibility called for clear policy targets and policy actions.

Secrecy about policy actions, whatever its potential shorter-term benefits, came at a potentially significant
longer-term cost. Monetary policy “surprises” might provide a short-term jolt to the economy. These
surprises were especially likely when policy was in the hands of politicians, perhaps seeking re-election.
But these actions nurtured longer-term suspicions that policymakers might neglect inflation, causing inflation
expectations to rise and policy credibility to fall.

If so, monetary surprises could prove self-defeating even in stimulating the economy. They would instead
5

merely stoke expectations of higher inflation. In the academic jargon, an “inflation bias” would emerge.

This theoretical story found empirical support in the behaviour of a number of advanced economies during
the 1970s, who experienced a so-called “Great Inflation”.

6

In part in response to the Great Inflation, a number of central banks began to be given new policy
responsibilities to reduce the potential for electorally-driven monetary surprises. Perhaps the most important
of those was operational independence for the setting of monetary policy. This was an institutional attempt
to avoid the temptation to stoke the economy in the short-term, and to anchor inflation expectations in the
longer-term, thereby building policy credibility.

With these new policy powers came, reasonably enough, new responsibilities for central banks. For the first
time in their histories, central banks needed to be far more open and transparent about their policy targets
and actions. Why? Because it was through greater transparency that policy suspicions among the public
could be allayed, thereby helping anchor inflation expectations in the economy.
As unelected technocrats acting on society’s behalf, operational independence also called for new means of
ensuring central banks were sufficiently accountable to society. Holding central banks’ feet to the flames
called for greater public transparency and greater public scrutiny than ever previously. Trust in central banks
could not be endowed by statute. It needed instead to be earned through experience and societal scrutiny.

These forces brought about a revolution in central bank practices regarding transparency and accountability.
Over the course of the past century, the number of Bank of England appearances before Parliament has
risen around 20-fold; the number of publications issued has risen around 600-fold; and the number of words
uttered has risen around 1,000-fold. You don’t need Tracy Chapman to tell you I’m talkin’ ‘bout a revolution.

Elsewhere around the world, the pattern has been much the same. We have seen a rising tide of speeches,
publications and parliamentary appearances by central banks. The Bank of Estonia has been at or close to
the frontier of this revolution. It was one of the first central banks to have a website, way back in 1995.

7

Today it provides a rich daily diet of reports, forecasts, working papers, speeches and tweets.
th

The 20 century may yet be seen by historians as a Golden Age for central banks. Central bank numbers
rose from under 20 at the start of the century to over 175 by its close. Those with operational independence
for monetary policy rose from fewer than 40 in 1971 to over 150 today. And the numbers of central banks
8

with responsibilities for regulatory policy has risen sharply too, especially since the crisis.

The rise in central bank numbers in part reflects the greater numbers of nation states in the 20 century. But
this, too, is revealing. Establishing a central bank has increasingly been seen as an essential building block
of nation state-building, a crucial element in the fabric of democratic statecraft. Indeed, that was precisely
the Estonian experience, as events in this very room a century ago testify.

The Age of Innocence

This Golden Age of central banking has persisted for a century. As best we can tell, it has served economies
and societies well. Prior to the crisis, the global economy entered a golden period of its own with steady
9

growth and stable inflation, known as the “Great Moderation”. Mervyn King, Bank of England Governor at
the time, gave this period a different name – the NICE (Non-inflationary consistently-expansionary)
decade.

10

It is not difficult to see why. Growth in advanced economies averaged 2.5% and inflation 2.2%. The volatility
of inflation was around 80% lower, and the volatility of output 5% lower, than in the preceding two decades
(Chart 1). With the economy performing NICE-ly, public trust in central banks was running high. Approval
ratings for the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England were all at healthy levels.

The global financial crisis has ushered in a new era. Great Moderation gave way first to a Great Recession
and then a Grudging Recovery. Advanced economy growth over the past decade has averaged only 1.5%.
The volatility of inflation has risen by 40%, and the volatility of output growth by 60%, relative to the pre-crisis
decade (Chart 1). The NICE decade has given way to a VILE (Volatile-Inflation Less-Expansionary) one.

11

It should perhaps come as no surprise that one of the casualties of the crisis has been levels of public trust in
the financial system, banks and central banks. Measures of satisfaction or confidence in central banks fell in
the UK, US and euro area at the time of the global financial crisis.

12

They have yet fully to recover and may

reflect diminished trust. The situation in Japan is similar, except their crisis came sooner and the bust in trust
has lasted longer.

Explaining this increasingly fragile trust in central banks is, in part, a story of the crisis. Pre-crisis, central
banks were seen as stewards of the financial system. A failure of that system inevitably then caused some
questioning of central banks’ stewardship role. The financial crisis was the catalyst for some loss of faith in
the stewards in much the same way the expenses scandal was for British political stewards a few years ago.

But there are also deeper-seated changes underway in the nature of the public’s trust, not specific to central
banks, what Rachel Botsman calls the “Trust Shift”.

13

Once upon a time, public trust was endowed on public

institutions rather than needing to be earned. Trust was anonymous and centralised. The public did not ask
difficult questions and public institutions, by and large, did not feel the need to provide answers. For public
institutions, this was the Age of Innocence.

As centralised and largely anonymous institutions, central banks surfed on this wave of blind trust during
their early years. During the Age of Innocence, there was no public expectation of openness or
accountability or need to build bridges with the public or parliaments. When quizzed for an explanation by a
Parliamentary Committee in 1930, Montagu Norman replied: “I don’t have reasons, I have instincts”.
But the public’s attitudes towards trust have altered and so too has the trust-building process. Faith in public
institutions is no longer blind. Trust is no longer endowed anonymously. Instead it is built through direct
connections, often personalised and localised. Trust is no longer centralised in institutions. Instead it is built
on a distributed basis, peer-by-peer, across the network. In short, the Age of Innocence is over.
As the public’s trust has shape-shifted, central banks and other public institutions have faced new challenges
to their trust. Indeed, this helps explain the first revolution in central bank transparency practices. But the
crisis has added cyclical push to this structural fall in trust. Central banks are no longer surfing a wave.
They face instead a retreating tide. For them, too, the Age of Innocence may be over.

While some loss of trust in central banks might have been expected, it is disappointing that the pre-crisis
revolution in transparency practices did not provide a greater degree of insulation against it. Why was
central banks’ stock of reputational capital, built steadily through various transparency initiatives, inadequate
to protect them from the crisis storm? I think there were two factors at play.

First, central banks have tools, such as interest rates and banking regulations, which support the whole of
the economy and financial system. They affect people’s lives greatly, supporting jobs and incomes, a stable
cost of living, an adequate supply of credit, confidence in money. But the impact of central banks’ tools is
often indirect and lagged; it is difficult for people to observe these benefits in their everyday lives.

When people get a job or a pay rise or a loan, they tend to attribute this to their own good luck or good
management. Rarely do they link it to actions taken by central banks, months or perhaps years earlier. The
benefits of central bank actions are, for most people, articles of faith rather than fact. These days, with trust
needing to be earned, this puts central banks at a natural disadvantage.

We see this pattern in other professions. In surveys, the general public are typically mistrustful of politicians
and bankers, who appear close to bottom of their trust league table. Yet their trust scores for local MPs and
13

Botsman (2017).

6

local bank branch managers have remained high because of their closer connection with people’s lives.
Central banks, operating economy-wide, perhaps face some of the same challenges as bankers and
politicians.

The second reason trust proved fragile is because its foundation is public understanding. Once public trust
is lost, public understanding becomes crucial to restore it. The hope was that the revolution in central bank
transparency initiatives had provided that improved public understanding of the economy and central banks.
In practice, the evidence suggests progress towards improving the public’s understanding of the economy,
finance and central banks has been slow and patchy, despite these initiatives.

To start with the positives, there is concrete evidence of the improved central bank communications having
improved the functioning of financial markets, the forecasting performance of economists and even the
reporting of the media on the economy.

14

The transparency revolution improved understanding among those

whose day job it was to understand the economy and the role of central banks within it – the experts.
The revolution appears to have had far less impact on understanding among the public – the non-experts. In
1999, the Bank of England began surveying the public to gauge their understanding of the economy and the
15

Bank.

Back then, only around 7% identified the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as responsible

for setting interest rates. 19 years and one transparency revolution later, the same survey earlier this year
suggested around 6% of the general public had heard of the MPC.

16

The failure to boost understanding of the economy and central banks among the general public helps explain
why trust in central banks proved more fragile than expected after the crisis. It is for these reasons I have
spoken about central banks facing a “twin deficits” problem – a deficit of public understanding and a deficit of
public trust.

17

These twin deficits are clearly complementary and mutually-reinforcing.

These twin deficits have not, so far at least, had especially serious consequences for central banks. There
has been no de-anchoring of inflation expectations. There has been no rolling-back of central bank
responsibilities nor systematic retreat from central bank operational independence on monetary and
regulatory matters. If anything, central banks’ sets of responsibilities have recently been added to.

At the same time, more questions are probably being asked about the role and powers of central bank than
at any time in a generation. That is in part a reflection of the increased responsibilities central banks have
been handed; in part a reflection of the higher expectations being placed on central banks’ actions; and in
part a reflection of the dent in trust in institutions the crisis has delivered. This is a triple challenge.

16
The same survey also gives the “Bank of England” as option to the question of which group sets interest rates. More respondents
identify the Bank of England as being responsible for setting interest rates (around 30%) than the Monetary Policy Committee, but this
too has been broadly flat over time.

A year ago, the Bank of England hosted a conference to mark 20 years since it was granted operational
independence for monetary policy. At that event, I was struck by the number of speakers calling time on the
Golden Age of central banks, speculating on whether “peak central bank” had been reached. Some asked
openly whether central bank independence was appropriate, at least on financial stability matters.

I am not as pessimistic or as fatalistic as that. But I do think some of those concerns about understanding,
trust and legitimacy are real. In response to them, new efforts may be needed to close the understanding
and trust deficits and bridge the transparency and accountability gaps. Doing so would, I believe, leave
central banks even better-informed and better-placed to deliver their core mandates in future. Here is why.

Correcting the Deficits

My answer comes in two, inter-related, parts. Let me take these in turn.

First, building understanding among the general public in the economy, financial system and central banks.

Most people would think an improved understanding of the economy among the general public is desirable.
It makes for improved decision-making by people on important everyday decisions on spending, saving,
borrowing and working. The better those individual decisions (the micro), the more stable the economy and
financial system are likely to be (the macro). Improved public understanding of the economy is in that sense
win-win, benefitting policymakers and the public alike.

But it is possible the benefits of improved public understanding in stabilising the economy and financial
system have been underestimated. “Popular narratives” among the public might be more important in driving
macro-economic behaviour than in the past. And these narratives may be more prone to destabilisation than
in the past. If so, too little may have been invested historically, by both the public and policymakers, in
informing these narratives and hence stabilising the economy.

Public understanding of the economy and finance starts from a low base. You do not have to take my word
for it. That is the strongly-held view of the public themselves. In surveys, almost half of the public say they
believe they lack an adequate understanding of economic and financial issues when making crucial
everyday decisions.

18

This is a weak endowment.

We now know quite a bit about the costs to individuals of this weak endowment, which appear to be large
and long-lasting. For example, poor levels of financial education have been shown to have large and lasting

18

effects on individuals’ health – financial, physical and mental.

19

Financial illiteracy is a recipe for debt, default

and depression, whose effects appear to feedback on each another in a vicious spiral.
These individual costs are amplified when they are aggregated up to the macro level. How people’s
expectations evolve – their degree of optimism or pessimism, exuberance or depression – is crucial for
determining their individual decisions. It has long been recognised that these expectations can be shaped
importantly by others’ expectations. For example, “popular narratives” can emerge which shape collective
expectations among the public – optimism or pessimism, exuberance or depression – and which can then
drive aggregate economic fluctuations.

20

Recent research has demonstrated just how powerful those emergent popular narratives can be,
economically and financially. As one example, the work of Nick Bloom and co-authors has constructed
various measures of businesses’ degree of uncertainty around key issues, based on the words used in
media reporting.

21

These narrative-based measures of uncertainty have been found to be important for

explaining the investment behaviour of companies over time.

David Tuckett and co-authors have constructed measures of the popular narratives used by participants in
22

financial markets.

They find that these narratives can play an important role in explaining asset price

dynamics, over and above the impact of macro-economic fundamentals. In a similar spirit, the work of
Michael Bailey and co-authors has found, using Facebook data, an important role for shared social
narratives in explaining behaviour in the housing market.

23

At a macroeconomic level, the work of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller has looked at the popular
narratives which emerge during periods of boom and bust.

24

Using words extracted from newspapers, they

find the prevailing popular narratives about the economy have played a significant role in accounting for the
heights of the peaks and depths of the troughs during macro-economic booms and busts. Public
expectations, embedded in the stories they tell, are a key macro-economic driver.
The common theme in all of this research is the importance of the public’s “narratives” in shaping their
behaviour. That is true individually but especially collectively – hence “popular narratives” – with shifts in
collective expectations helping account for the width and depth of macro-economic fluctuations. As well as
contributing to this research, the Bank has begun using these “narrative” approaches itself to help
understand behaviour. Let me give you a topical example.

The Bank’s Agents around the UK have a wide network of company contacts who they visit regularly to
discuss the economy. These visits are then written up. These write-ups enable a semantic search to be
carried out to identify the key themes or narratives emerging in companies’ conversations. You will be
unsurprised to hear that a key theme among companies over recent quarters has been uncertainty
surrounding Brexit.

Figure 1 plots a word cloud extracted from those company write-ups. The size of each word connotes the
frequency of its use in relation to mentions of “uncertainty”. For a word that did not exist as recently as five
years ago, it is striking how Brexit is now dominating companies’ conversations. Currently, it crops up 10
times more often than the word “customer” and almost 7 times more often than the word “staff” in proximity to
uncertainty.

25

Chart 2 plots a time-series of the incidence of the words “uncertainty” and “Brexit/referendum” in Agents’
company write-ups. The two, unsurprisingly, are positively correlated after the referendum. Indeed,
mentions of Brexit have outnumbered mentions of uncertainty by a factor of around 3 since the referendum.
While mentions of Brexit have fallen from their referendum peak, it is notable that they have picked up
sharply over the past few months, with measures of uncertainty following suit.

This new research strengthens the case for improving public understanding of the economy. An improved
understanding could result in better-informed popular narratives, and more stable expectations, among the
general. And that, ultimately, would make for a more stable economy and financial system.

In practice, there may be structural factors which could be acting in the opposite direction. The great trust
shift may mean people are less willing than in the past to trust expert opinion (such as through mainstream
media) and more willing to trust non-expert opinion (such as some parts of social media). Around half of
those in the EU use social media as a news source and, among those aged 18-24 in the UK, around a
quarter use it as their main news source.

26

Yet we know that information from social media sources is typically filtered and personalised.

27

That fits

people’s (personalised, localised) preferences. But it also results in news narratives which are more likely to
be self-reinforcing and self-referential than in the past. The echoes in this chamber are louder, reach further,
last longer. They are also less likely to be balanced and objective. More powerful, but less balanced,
popular narratives are a potentially destabilising influence on expectations and the economy.

This research points in one direction. The case for improved public understanding of the economy and
financial system has always been strong. But in a world where popular narratives are even more important

25

This analysis uses company visit write-ups produced by the Bank’s Agents themselves, rather than contacts so is of course only a
proxy for the latter’s views.

in driving economic behaviour, and where these narratives may be even more susceptible to destabilisation,
the case for improving public understanding is significantly reinforced. This is one blade of the scissors of
public engagement.
The second blade is building central banks’ understanding of the economy and financial system through the
general public.

This is newer, but I believe fertile, ground for central banks. Central banks pride themselves, rightly, on their
technocratic skills and economic expertise. There are limits to that knowledge, as there are to knowledge in
every domain and discipline. Those limits and uncertainties need importantly to be recognised when
understanding the economy and when setting policy.

Nonetheless, it would be a false step to dispense with that expertise. No one seriously questions the need
for heart surgeons or car mechanics, the need for specialist knowledge and experienced decision-making
when repairing hearts or car parts. Human bodies and car engines are complex environments. But so too is
the economic and financial system. It too needs specialist knowledge and experienced decision-makers.

It does not follow from this, however, that expertise cannot be augmented or improved on by drawing on as
wide a set of opinions as possible, expert and non-expert. Non-experts can provide a different lens on
problems and solutions. This diversity of thought has been found to be especially useful in complex decision
environments. Colloquially, that is why we call it “folk wisdom”. Back in 2004, James Surowiecki gave it
another name – the “wisdom of crowds”.

28

There are now many examples of collective wisdom at work.

th

The most celebrated is 19 century English statistician Francis Galton’s amazement at the accuracy of the
average guesses about the weight of an ox among visitors to a county fair. Less celebrated (though, as it
turns out, more accurate) was English magician Derren Brown’s attempt to predict the UK National Lottery
results in 2009 using the wisdom of crowds. The wisdom of crowds is not magic. Subsequent research has
found that it relies instead on two factors: diversity and deliberation.

To take these in turn, the value of diversity in complex decision-making is fairly well-understood. Diversity of
thought simultaneously increases the chances of creative solutions being found, while reducing the chances
of terrible solutions being adopted. It fattens the upper tail, and thins the lower tail, of the insight distribution.
Diversity delivers higher return for lower risk.

29

These benefits arise, in part, from having a wider pool of ideas in which to fish and a deeper pool in which to
dilute risks. But they also arise from the collective benefits of having these new ideas and risks challenged
and filtered by a group. The benefits of diversity arise as much from interactions within the group, as from

28
29

Surowiecki (2004).
Haldane (2016).
11

11

the new ideas each person brings. But both are important for good ideas to emerge and for bad ideas to
submerge. And it is this which fattens returns and slims risks, whatever the decision.

These benefits have been demonstrated in a number of real-world settings. In his book The Difference,
Scott Page goes a step further with a “Diversity Trumps Ability” theorem.

30

This states that the

highest-performing team is very unlikely to arise from bringing together the individually-best experts.
Instead it comes from combining insights from diverse sources, expert and non-expert. It comes from a
cocktail of experience, some specialist, some generalist.

The returns to diversity are not limitless. When choosing the optimal asset portfolio, most of the benefits of
diversification come from the first few assets. The same is true when the assets are people. The diversity
benefits in moving from 2 to 4 people are large compared with the diversity benefits of going from 102 to 104
people. There are probably diminishing returns to diversity.

The second factor important for the wisdom of crowds is deliberation. Complex decisions require an
investment of time, a period of deliberation. This is needed to understand a complex problem, consider it
from different angles, to test it with different solutions. Solving complex problems does not in general call for
instinctive, “fast thinking” of the type described by Daniel Kahneman in his famous book, Thinking Fast and
Slow.

31

It instead calls for “slow thinking”, for System 2 rather than System 1 thinking.

Time is also important when harvesting the benefits of interactions within a diverse group. It takes time for
groups to explore and test their ideas, winnowing out the winners and filtering out the losers. It takes time for
people to change their minds. As with diversity, there are decreasing returns to deliberation time. Research
suggests that spending as little as 1 hour on a complex problem can improve performance by 10%.

32

These

benefits are likely to be smaller when moving from 100 to 101 hours spent on the same problem.

While diversity and deliberation are the cornerstones of the wisdom of crowds, it is clear that crowds are not
always and everywhere wise. I am rarely much the wiser about the parentage of a football referee for having
listened to the collective chants of the crowd. This observation is not a new one; it has a long historical
pedigree. In 1841, Charles Mackay published a now-famous book whose title stands in stark contrast to
Surowiecki’s – Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.

33

Many subsequent authors have provided examples of collective irrationality in crowd decision-making. Its
causes have also been extensively studied by psychologists, sociologists and economists.

34

This originates

in the contagious spread of opinion through networks. The larger and more connected the network, and the
less well-informed its participants, the greater the chances of irrational epidemics spreading.

The behaviour underpinning this group psychology is as old as humankind. The desire to conform to group
type has its roots in our hunter-gatherer past. It has been found, time and again, in studies of human
behaviour from the South Sea Bubble to the dotcom bubble, from the Bay of Pigs to the space shuttle
disasters.

35

This collective irrationality sometimes goes by the name “groupthink”.

More recently, these psychological roots may have been fed and watered by technological advances, such
as social media. This has increased our digital connectivity. For reasons set out earlier, it has probably also
increased the chances of self-reinforcing and self-referential waves of collective irrationality taking hold.

36

If

so, these waves of collective irrationality could be becoming larger than ever. While a vestige of our
hunter-gatherer past, the madness of crowds can these days spread to a global village.

That leaves us with a conundrum. If decision-makers in complex environments were to draw on a wider set
of non-expert opinion, what are they likely to encounter? Is it a case of harnessing the wisdom of crowds or
avoiding their madness? Will greater public engagement help inform and improve expert decision-making by
widening the pool of lived experience? Or will it hinder that decision-making by polluting the information pool
with irrational or irrelevant opinions?

Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the value of expert and non-expert opinion, as it applies to
complex decision-making in the social sciences, has been provided by political scientist Philip Tetlock.
Over a more than 20-year period, he has researched forecast accuracy and, most recently, run The Good
Judgement Project. This explored the performance of a set of experts and non-experts in forecasting the
outcome of a particularly complex set of decision problems.
So what does Tetlock’s evidence suggest? That the usefulness of non-expert opinion in complex decision
settings depends on how exactly this information is drawn in and drawn on. From Tetlock’s book with
Dan Gardner in 2015, Super-forecasting, I would highlight two key findings. These chime with the evidence
outlined earlier on the costs and benefits of expert and non-expert opinion in collective decision-making.

First, there is real value in non-expert opinion when it comes to complex forecasting tasks. In a famous
example, Tetlock convened a group of 1,000 amateur forecasters and entered them in a prestigious
forecasting tournament run by the US intelligence agencies (IARPA).

37

This team beat the control group by

60% in year 1 and 78% in year 2. It not only beat expert academics from MIT to Colombia, but professionals
from the US intelligence services with access to classified information.

This is what Tetlock calls Super-forecasting. The incremental value of non-expert judgements has been
shown in a wide array of settings and for a wide range of complex problems. What about judgments on the

complex dynamics of the economic and financial system? While we do not have a structured experiment on
which to draw, we do have illustrative evidence on the relative forecasting performance of different groups.
Chart 3 considers the forecast errors of five groups – three “expert” (MPC, a panel of professional
forecasters and financial markets) and two “non-expert” (companies and households). For each group we
consider their forecasts for UK inflation 1, 2 and 3 years ahead. The sample period is relatively short so our
conclusions need to be cautious. And forecast accuracy is not the same as policy acumen. Nonetheless,
Chart 3 suggests that, in a complex forecasting task, there is little to choose between experts and
38

non-experts.

Tetlock’s second key point, which qualifies his first, is that not everyone can be a super-forecaster. A
randomly-chosen panel of non-experts cannot by itself be expected to outperform the experts. Chart 3
demonstrates that. Super-forecasting is not simply a law of large numbers. Tetlock shows that non-expert
super-forecasters have particular characteristics, including inquisitiveness and independence of mind. Only
those with these characteristics consistently outperform the experts.

We do not have a clean test of this hypothesis for our inflation forecasts. But just imagine the Bank had
been able to identify in advance one “super-forecaster” among the pool of outside forecasters. How much
would that have improved its forecasts over the sample period? The gap in two year-ahead forecast errors
between the MPC and the best external forecaster in the panel of outside forecasters is around ¼
percentage point. 20/20 hindsight is a wonderful thing, but this gives some measure of the scope for
forecast improvement.

39

If we take Tetlock’s points together, they suggest that there is real value in seeking the views of non-experts
to help inform difficult decisions. But there are limits to these benefits. It is unrealistic to expect everyone to
become a super-forecaster. For central banks the message is that, by widening their information net, they
could stand to benefit from the wisdom of crowds. But there are limits to how and to how far you would wish
to widen the net if the crowd is to add signal rather than noise.

To illustrate this point, consider the following thought-experiment. Imagine you have an endowment of
time – 10,000 hours – to make as informed a decision as possible on a complex question. I have not chosen
10,000 hours randomly. In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell argues, based on a detailed set of case
studies, that it takes around 10,000 hours for one person to command true expertise in a subject area.
Now let’s choose a complex, and topical, question: will Artificial Intelligence (AI) cause mass
unemployment? It is well-known that the views of experts (and non-experts) differ widely on this complex

38

The conditioning assumptions (such as the assumed path of interest rates) and purpose of forecasts will vary between central banks
and other forecasters.

question and that the outcome is very uncertain. The problem we need to solve is not this but a simpler one:
how many people should we choose to help inform our view on the impact of AI on unemployment?
One possible answer to this question is one person. With Gladwell’s 10,000 hours under their belt, this
person would be as well-informed on the impact of AI on unemployment as anyone on the planet – a true
expert, perhaps even a phenomenon. This is the single person or, if you like, Oracle (in the Ancient Greek
sense of the word) solution to this decision problem.

But is it the optimal one? There are reasons for doubt. Evidence clearly suggests that, in a complex
decision environment, drawing on non-expert opinion can provide added insight. It offers diversity of
perspective, whose benefits are amplified if those diverse perspectives are discussed and debated to arrive
at collective conclusions. This is Surowiecki’s “wisdom of crowds” at work.
So let’s go to the other end of the spectrum and draw instead on the insights of a big crowd – say, 1 million
people, roughly the adult population of Estonia. This would then, in effect, be an Estonian referendum on
AI and unemployment. Clearly, we would now be drawing on a vast array of expert and non-expert opinion.
But that would come at the expense of less time for deliberation. Given our time quota, each person would
now have only around 30 seconds to give an answer.

Facing a tight time constraint and a very complex question, most people would struggle. I certainly would.
The best a non-expert could probably do is to provide an instinctive, “fast thinking” response. Or, perhaps
more likely still, they might jump aboard a collective, but potentially poorly-informed, bandwagon by copying
what others say. This would increase greatly the chances of Mackay’s “madness of crowds”.
Finally, let’s try an interior solution – say 1,000 people each spending 10 hours. This is large enough a
number to gather most of the benefits of diversity, but small enough to harvest the benefits of deliberation.
It would blend expert and non-expert opinion in a way which would allow collective deliberation. This is the
“wisdom of crowds” solution.

Figure 2 plots the relationship between insight and the numbers of people providing information in a group, in
stylised terms. You might call it the “Insight Curve”. The curve (shown in dotted lines) results from
combining the effects of a downward-sloping “deliberation” curve and an upward-sloping “diversity” curve.
Consistent with the evidence, both exhibit diminishing returns. The inverted U-shaped “Insight Curve”
identifies the optimal number of people to draw on to inform a complex decision.
The two corner solutions – the “Oracle” (single person) and the “Madness of Crowds” (population) – involve
very different trade-offs between diversity and deliberation. A single source of information gives you plenty
of time for deliberation – a hermit-like 10,000 hours. But it leaves you short of diversity of thought. A

15

15

population-wide pool of information gives us as much diversity as you could ever wish. But it leaves you long
fast-thinkers, short slow-thinkers and vulnerable to irrationality.
Both are inferior to an intermediate solution – the “Wisdom of Crowds” solution. This involves combining the
insights from both experts and non-experts, to reap the benefits of diversity of thought and action. But this
larger pool is not so large as to dilute the time available for slow-thinking and deliberation. It is a cocktail of
expert and non-expert opinion, comprising diversity and deliberation in equal measure, that cause good
ideas to flourish and bad ones to perish.

A relevant, practical question is where the optimal point along the insight curve lies. What is the optimal
number of people from whom to seek views if we are to maximise the benefits of folk wisdom? My stylised
example cannot provide an answer to that question. But some studies have looked at this question using
experimental methods and, reach interesting conclusions.

Christian Wagner and Tom Vinaimont ask two questions.

40

First, how large does a group of non-experts

need to be to exhibit expert-like performance? Second, how large does this group need to be to outperform
consistently a group of experts? On the assumption experts’ views are ten times more precise than a
non-expert, their answer to the first question is around 30 and the second around 1,000. This bookends the
range of non-expert views we might need in seeking the “wisdom of crowds”.

Representative Decision-Making

If we take this analysis at face value, the question is how practically central banks can engage a wider,
non-expert, audience to help inform their views on the economy and financial system? What new
infrastructure or architecture is needed for collecting and assimilating these views? And how do we ensure
they balance diversity and deliberation so as to be representative of the general public’s views?

These are deep questions, but they are not new ones. They have been debated by philosophers and
political scientists for thousands of years. Alternative models of representative decision-making have been
tried and tested throughout the course of history. This experience contains some useful lessons for central
banks, and other public institutions, seeking to strengthen the infrastructure linking them to wider society.
Let’s start at the very beginning. The birthplace of democracy is, for many, ancient Greece. Around 2,500
years ago, the city-state of Athens pioneered a particular form of representative decision-making when it
came to judgements on some of the most complex, societally-significant, issues of the day. The centrepiece
of this decision-making infrastructure was a public body – a Council of Five Hundred, or boule.

16

The boule comprised individuals drawn from the general public by random selection (or sortition). They
served for a year. The purpose of the boule was to debate key issues affecting public life and devise policy
proposals. These were then taken to a public assembly for discussion, where a wider set of the general
public participated, often running into the thousands. For a small number of positions requiring specialist
skills, public officials and experts were elected or appointed.

The Athenian boule was not democratic embroidery, like a modern-day focus group. It had real power. It
decided which proposals were taken to the public assembly and which were lawful. Brett Hennig calls it the
“nerve centre of power” in ancient Athens.

41

The boule had wide public acceptance and attendance.

Participation in public life, through the boule or public assembly, was an accepted part of Athenians’ civic
responsibilities. Those not taking part were termed idiotes, from which the modern word idiot derives.

The infrastructure was far from perfect; the boule excluded women, slaves and non-citizens. But it was
notable in seeking to strike a balance between the two features subsequent research has shown to be
crucial for effective, representative decision-making in complex environments: diversity and deliberation.
42

Indeed, for that reason some have called the Athenian model of decision-making a deliberative democracy.

Diversity of decision-making was achieved by calling on a rotating, randomly-selected pool of non-expert
citizens, augmented by experts in a limited number of positions. Deliberation in decision-making was
achieved by restricting the number of representatives, having them convene and discuss regularly and agree
on a set of proposals. The Council of Five Hundred sits slap bang in the middle of the optimal range of
people suggested by Wagner and Vinaimont.

The Greek Empire of course did not last. Nor did its model of deliberative democracy for decision-making.
In the period since, two alternative models of representative decision-making have risen to prominence.
Interestingly, these seek to strike a rather different balance between diversity and deliberation, both relative
to the Athenian model and especially relative to each other.

One is executive democracy. Under this model, an elected or appointed set of representatives take
decisions on society’s behalf, often through a Parliament or Congress. This model underpins modern
democracies in a great many countries; it has grown in popularity for much of the past 200 years. Such has
been its success, many people these days would define democracy in terms of this model.

For most of history, this was not the case. Aristotle was not alone in seeing an executive democratic model
as an “elected oligarchy”.

43

At the time many executive democracies were being put in place, their Founding

Fathers (they were all still men) were often deeply suspicious of Athenian-style democracy. John Adams,

second President of the United States, captured it thus: “Remember democracy never lasts long. It soon
wastes, exhausts and murders itself”.

44

The Greek Empire lasted only 350 years before exhausting itself.

While Adams was wrong about the durability of executive democracy, suspicions about whether it properly
represents all slices of society have persisted. Indeed, these suspicions have risen recently. At the same
time as the steady ascent in the numbers of countries adopting the executive democratic model, there has
been a steady descent in public trust in the representatives of executive democratic institutions.

At the heart of those trust problems are concerns about whether decision-making is sufficiently reflective of
wider society. By and large, the public accept that the executive democratic model is a reasonable vehicle
for discussion and deliberation in decision-making. Indeed, the public can watch those deliberations on TV.
But there is a concern among the public about whether decision-making and decision-makers are sufficiently
diverse, whether they properly reflect and represent societies’ views and needs.
This is not an accusation that could be levelled at the alternative model of representative decision-making –
so-called direct democracy. This puts voice and vote firmly in the hands of public on decisions with an
important bearing on wider society. This model has been used to varying degrees across various countries
at various times. In some countries, public referenda are reserved for decisions whose societal impact is
especially large and long-lasting. I am sure we can all think of examples.

This model is recognised as having both pros and cons. It draws in a much wider range of expert and
non-expert opinion, so achieves a potentially greater degree of representativeness and diversity than
alternatives. This very breadth, however, makes it difficult to have a deliberative dialogue in which
participants have the time to consider carefully the facts, competing hypotheses and possible solutions. This
risks the collective view being less well-informed, and potentially more polarised, than would be ideal.

With degrees of discontent about both the executive and direct democratic models, there has recently been a
rekindling of interest in the Athenian, or deliberative democracy, model. This model, at least in principle,
offers greater diversity than the executive democratic model. It also offers greater scope for debate and
deliberation than the direct democratic model. It is not a third way, as it was in fact the first. But it is a
middle way. It is in some ways the institutional incarnation of the “Insight Curve”.

Interestingly, a number of countries have over recent years begun experimenting with deliberative
democratic processes to debate and resolve some of societies’ most complex problems. Citizens’ panels or
juries have been used to tackle such varied issues as voting reform (in Canada), gay rights (Ireland),
reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous communities (Australia), nuclear power (South
Korea), membership of the euro (Denmark) and environmental pollution (United States).

Here in Estonia, you have experience of using people’s assemblies to debate key societal issues. In 2013, a
people’s assembly (Rahvakogu) was used to debate Estonian electoral laws. Last year, a people’s
assembly was used to deliberate on the future of ageing and pension reform. People’s juries have also been
used to debate regional issues, including water transportation in the Emajõgi River region of the country.
Estonia has been a relative hotbed of activity on deliberative decision-making in practice.

Each of these experiments used slightly differently approaches. This has provided useful case law on which
to decide what works and when. One interesting finding is that citizens’ panels can be effective not just in
getting people to engage on issues of national or regional importance, but in providing an effective forum for
people to change their minds, and converge in their opinions, on these issues. They can reduce
polarisation. These benefits lie at the heart of the deliberative democratic process.

A second lesson is that technology is a potential game-changer for deliberative decision-making. This relies
on a distributed, modular structure. Historically, structures such as the size of the boule placed physical
constraints on the scope for information-making and debate. Digital structures loosen those constraints,
allowing longer reach and greater connectivity at greater speed. Some countries have begun using digital
technologies to support their deliberative processes, including here in Estonia.

The benefits of doing so are partly practical, with greater numbers of people able to connect and
communicate than ever previously. The public assemblies of Ancient Greece brought together people in
their thousands. Today, technology could do so for millions of people. There are also, however, behavioural
benefits. The “trust shift” among the public means credibility and understanding is more often these days
built through distributed means and direct connections. A digital infrastructure can help those ends meet.
It could be argued that these country-level experiments are just that – experiments. The deliberative model
has not been tried and tested in anger for the full gamut of societal decisions. As put, that is true. Yet there
is at least one domain of public policy where this model has been tried and tested (both literally and
metaphorically) for a wide range of societal decisions over many centuries: the judicial system.

Many judicial systems draw on both expert (judges) and non-expert (juries) opinion, like the Athenians.
Non-experts are drawn randomly from the population, as in Athens. There is a clear process for deliberation
among participants, as in the boule. This system is the nerve-centre of decision-making on a defined set of
issues, as in Ancient Greece. The English judicial system has already lasted for almost 1,000 years, more
than twice as long as the Greek Empire.

The Next Revolution

Against this backdrop, what concrete steps might central banks take to build an improved infrastructure for
engagement with the general public? Can it build on others’ experience in engaging wider society, in ways
which improve the public’s and policymakers’ understanding of the economy? Let me offer some
suggestions, which are motivated by recent initiatives at the Bank of England aimed at doing just that.

(a)

Minding Your Language

Historically, the language of central banks has often been pitched at a level which has made it difficult for
most non-experts to understand. This has contributed to the public’s understanding and trust deficits.
Slowly but surely, that is beginning to change. Central bank’s external communications are being reoriented
towards a wider, non-specialist audience. Let me give a couple of examples.
The first is so-called “forward guidance” about monetary policy.

46

How you judge its success hinges crucially

on what you consider to have been its objective and audience. If you are a financial market participant
whose job it is to price the future path of interest rates, the most useful type of policy guidance is precise and
time-specific. By contrast, if you are a company or household considering whether to spend, a general idea
of the direction and destination of interest rates is likely to be sufficient.

The critics of forward guidance have tended to be financial market participants for whom it lacks sufficient
precision and time-specificity. But forward guidance simply cannot be that precise; it depends on the path of
the economy. And pricing interest rates in financial markets was not the main purpose of forward guidance
in the first place. Its purpose was to support spending in the economy by households and companies. That
calls for shorter and simpler guidance, focussed on the broad direction and destination of interest rates.
The MPC first used the words “limited and gradual” in 2014 when describing the likely future course of
interest rates rises. It was short and simple – three little words. It was guidance aimed squarely at
households and companies, offering them an indication (but no promise) of the broad direction and
destination of interest rates. Surveys suggest this message was understood by a majority of companies and
47

some households.

By allaying fears about too-rapid a rise in rates, it is likely to have encouraged spending

and supported the economy.

When the MPC did come to raise interest rates, in November 2017 and again in August 2018, it is interesting
to see how well these were understood by companies and households. Around three-quarters of
households, and around 90% of companies, had expected a rise in rates within the year ahead in surveys

46

Bank of England (2013) provides a useful summary of concepts and issues relating to forward guidance; see Carney (2018) for a
more recent discussion.

held immediately prior to the decisions. Simple, directional forward guidance on monetary policy appears,
for this non-expert audience who comprise most of the spending in the economy, to have been effective.
A second monetary policy example comes from the Bank’s quarterly Inflation Report. This was first
produced over 25 years ago, as part of the first wave of the transparency revolution. It is a long and
technical document, with language requiring at least 13-14 years of education to understand.

48

The

complexity of its language meant the Report was probably only accessible to around 10% of the population.
In November 2017, the Bank began publishing two simpler, “layered” versions of its Report. Layer 1 is the
single sentence/single graphic version, pitched at a level which is accessible to around two-thirds of the
population. Layer 2 is the single page/simple graphics version, accessible to over 40%. Measured in web
hits and downloads, these layered communications appear to have broadened notably the reach of the
MPC’s monetary policy messages, in particular among a non-expert audience.

A couple of recent research studies have used experimental methods to look more closely at the impact of
the Bank’s simpler communications on public understanding and trust.

49

For example, in a randomised

control trial of over 2,000 members of the general public, a recent study found that use of the visual
summaries increased the public’s understanding of the Inflation Report’s messages by around 25%. This is
a very substantial gain in public understanding for a fairly modest change in format.

This study went, however, one step further and asked whether further improvements in understanding were
possible. The format they considered personalised the language, making it more relatable to people’s
everyday lives – for example, by greater use of the first and second person (us/you), greater use of
commonly-used words (“rising prices” rather than “inflation”) and with more engaging, interactive graphics.
Doing so increased the gain in public understanding by 40%.

There are limits to what simplification, personalisation and visualisation can achieve. The same study
assessed how these changes in format affected the general public’s trust in the Bank of England’s policies.
These gains were modest. Perhaps that should come as no surprise. Understanding is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for trust-building. And trust tends to be earned slowly from repeated experience.

Nonetheless, these studies point to an important role for simpler, personalised communications in lowering
the twin deficits. There probably further for this agenda to run. For example, there is no reason in principle
why the same methods could not be applied to other central bank publications, covering the financial system
and banknotes. The Bank has already made some strides in this direction through its Financial Stability
Report and Knowledge Bank, aimed at improving public understanding of the economy and finance.

21

Looking ahead, in my view greater personalisation of central bank communications holds promise. Central
banks often affect people’s lives in ways which are lagged and indirect and hence difficult for them to
observe. Earlier this year, I constructed “personalised” scorecards, which set out the impact of the Bank’s
monetary policy easing actions after the global financial crisis on the income, wealth and well-being of
citizens across the UK.

50

This recognised that the impact of monetary policy on people’s lives is often quite different depending on
their personal circumstances – old versus young, borrower versus saver, home-owner versus renter, North
versus South. Casting the impact of monetary policy in terms of averages or aggregates tends not to
resonate with people’s personal experience. Spelling out the benefits in personalised terms can potentially
increase understanding and awareness of central banks’ actions.
There is already a precedent for this in another arm of UK policymaking – tax policy. Taxpayers in the UK
receive a personal scorecard, telling them how their tax payments have funded spending on various public
goods at the macro-economic level. This personalisation has been found to have improved the public’s
understanding and acceptance of tax policies.

(b)

51

Public Education

A second way of improving public understanding is through improved public education. Many central banks
have made efforts in this direction over a number of years, including through school visits, schools
competitions and schools materials, including at the Bank of England and Bank of Estonia. That does not
yet appear to have satiated demand from pupils and their parents, almost 80% of who say they think
52

economics should form part of the curriculum.

In part in response, earlier this year the Bank of England launched a new education strategy. There are a
number of elements. One is a new set of schools competitions, aimed at reaching a broader range of
students. A second is a schools ambassador programme, with Bank officials giving 200 talks in schools
across the UK this year. We are on schedule to hit our target.

The most ambitious part of our education strategy has been to develop classroom materials on the economy
and financial system for use in schools as part of the curriculum for pupils aged 11-16. These go by the
name econoME. As the name suggests, and like our recent public communications efforts, these materials
describe the economy and finance in terms which are personal and relatable to young people’s lives. Why
does the economy and finance matter to me? And how do my decisions in turn affect the economy?

22

We set ourselves a target of reaching 400 state schools with econoME during the course of this year. So far
since launch in April, over 1,000 schools have downloaded the materials, conceivably covering around
90,000 pupils.

53

This demonstrates the potential pent-up demand for school materials on economic and

financial issues. The Bank’s aim is to reach close to 1,500 schools by mid-2020.

We are currently considering where next to take our education initiatives. A promising avenue would be a
younger age range, say 7-11 year olds. This will require different materials and possibly a different
approach. A more challenging market still would be adults, perhaps linked to existing initiatives to boost
economic and financial literacy in the public at large. The scale of the public understanding deficit means
central bank efforts can only be part of the solution but, as public institutions, an important part.

(c)

A Distributed Architecture

Central banks historically have tended to be, well, centralised. But in a world where understanding of the
economy is often localised and trust is built on a distributed basis, a centralised infrastructure may be far
from ideal. What is needed instead is a distributed architecture for engagement. In response, central banks
have over time changed their structures and further change seems likely.
The Bank of England has had a network of Agents around the UK for around 90 years. Today, the Bank’s
twelve regional agencies cover all corners of the UK, with an extensive network that generates around 9,000
meetings with company contacts each year. This is a valuable source of intelligence on the economy and
financial system. Indeed, I would say it is increasingly valuable. It provides colour and context to
accompany our data and models. It offers folk wisdom, the wisdom of the company crowd.

But companies are only one crowd among many. Companies are an important lens on the economy, but far
from being the only one. Reflecting that, the Bank has recently sought stronger connections with some other
crowds, crowds with a different lens on the economy with which it has perhaps had less contact historically –
trades unions, charities, community organisations and the like.
For more than a year, I have augmented those Agents’ efforts with my own “Townhall” meetings across the
UK.

54

By design, these seek out the views of a wider range of citizens, in a wider range of locations on a

wider range of issues around the economy and financial system than has been the case in the past.

These events have established for me that there is wisdom in these crowds when gauging some of the key
issues shaping the economy and financial system. The lived experience of everyday people making
everyday decisions is what makes the economy tick (and sometimes tock). Tapping that lived experience

23

can add to the Bank’s understanding of the economy and help it when setting policy to keep the economy
stable. There is wisdom in crowds of citizens, as there is in crowds of companies.

55

The Bank is now taking a further step towards putting in place an infrastructure to formalise its engagement
with citizens. Earlier this year, in response to a recommendation from the RSA, we announced that the Bank
would be setting-up a set of Citizens’ Panels across the UK.

56

In the remainder of this year, we will be

running trials of these citizen panels to help us decide how best to organise them, before rolling them out
systematically, UK-wide, next year.

There are a number of key design questions that need to be answered. How do you ensure as wide, diverse
and representative a set of citizens as possible? How do you engage citizens who might not understand or
trust the Bank? How much time needs to be set aside to enable the deliberative process to be fruitful? And
how many people should you engage to get the balance right between diversity and deliberation? We are
working with a range of partners, including the RSA, to come up with answers.
The plan would be to set up one citizen panel for each of the Bank’s 12 regional agencies. With roughly 25
citizens per panel, this would give us a non-expert panel of around 300 people. This is edging up towards
the mid-point of the Wagner/Vinaimont range and just shy of the Athenian boule. By using digital
technology, we would aim to connect these citizen panels to allow national, as well as regional, deliberation.

This is deliberative democracy in practice. As with the judicial system, it will involve a blend of expert and
non-experts. As with juries and judges, there will be a structured process for deliberation. As in the legal
system, the role of the non-experts (citizen panels) is to help establish the facts and of the experts (MPC) to
set policy. What’s good enough for decisions on incarceration is good enough for decisions on inflation.

Conclusion

Central banks, like all public institutions, were created by the public to serve the public. Despite a
communications revolution, public understanding of central banks remains low and public trust in central
banks has fallen. Improving both calls for a second revolution, focussed on educating and learning from the
general public. The Age of Innocence may be over, but the Era of Engagement has only just begun.
st

This new era may mean 21 century central banks becoming more disbursed and personalised in their
communications, creating new infrastructure to interact with the public and extract their folk wisdom.
Thomas Jefferson said democracy is something you can only learn by doing. The same is true of central
banking. For the Bank of Estonia entering its second century, and for the Bank of England in its fourth, there
is much still to learn and even more to do.
