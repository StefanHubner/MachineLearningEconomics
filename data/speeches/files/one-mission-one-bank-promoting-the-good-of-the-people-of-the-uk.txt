It is a great honour to be invited to give the 30th Mais Lecture. This lecture series has charted the evolution
of UK macroeconomic policy through the eyes of leading policymakers, including my four predecessors as
Governor.

The Mais Lectures span a period during which the focus of macroeconomic management was firmly on
monetary policy. They helped establish a broad consensus for the primacy of price stability as well as the
institutional framework necessary to deliver it.

This focus initially made sense since one of the greatest challenges for macroeconomic policy in the late
1970s and 1980s was the fight against inflation.1 That fight culminated in the adoption of an inflation target,
which helped secure 15 years of price stability and sustained economic growth.

However, with time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction.

The financial crisis that exploded the Great Moderation was a powerful reminder that price stability is not
sufficient to maintain macroeconomic stability. Words which had alluded to such risks were not followed by
actions that might have prevented them being realised.

Lessons have since been learned. In the wake of the crisis, the Bank of England would be promised
enormous new powers and responsibilities. In the past year those promises have become realities with the
statutory Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) formally joining
the Bank.

The question now is how we use our powers to fulfil our responsibilities.

In response, the Bank of England is today launching a transformative strategic plan to fulfil its broader
mission. We have a new leadership team. We are setting out fifteen initiatives to reshape the institution.
Behind that plan is a vision for the Bank that I want to set out this evening. It is:

A Bank with many and varied responsibilities, but a single timeless mission;

An institution that works as One Bank to exploit the synergies and complementarities across our policy
functions;

A Bank that draws on its long history of intellectual leadership and international engagement to shape an
open, resilient global system;

And a Bank that builds on the immense successes of the past quarter century in combining clear objectives,
good governance and constructive transparency.

A single timeless mission

Let me begin by asking a simple question: what is the Bank of England for?

The Bank’s founding charter of 1694 explains that its original purpose was to ‘promote the publick Good and
Benefit of our People…’. What that meant in practice at the time was pithily summarised by the diarist
John Evelyn, who recorded the event 320 years ago in the following terms: ‘A publick bank... set up by Act of
Parliament… for money to carry on the war’. The war in question was against France, and in return for the
monies raised the Bank received both income and banking privileges: it was soon the only bank allowed to
be constituted as a joint stock company, and had an effective monopoly of the note issue in the London
area.2
Its size – partly resulting from its unique joint stock status – meant that, by the first half of the 19th Century,
the Bank had become the dominant part of the financial infrastructure. Its notes had become an accepted
means of settlement between banks, and as the provider of those notes the Bank acted as banker to other
banks. Commercial banks held Bank of England notes in place of gold, relying on the Bank of England’s
credibility for ultimate convertibility.
Despite the Bank’s founding aim of public service, criticism persisted until after the middle of the 19th Century
that it was acting in its own rather than the public interest by protecting its gold reserves at times of financial
stress, to the detriment of its customers. That criticism faded as the Bank gradually assumed the role of
lender of last resort, adopting Bagehot’s principle that it should lend freely against good collateral at penalty
rates in times of crisis.3
By the end of the 19th Century the Bank of England had informal responsibility for a broad range of policy
areas. It remained the fiscal agent for the government. It maintained monetary stability through the
operation of the Gold Standard. And it promoted financial stability through its role as the effective lender of
last resort, and more generally – through the judicious exercise of the Governor’s eyebrows – as the
institution which managed and resolved financial crises.4

2

Other banks were restricted to partnerships of up to 6 members.
During the 1866 and 1878 crises the Bank lent freely to the system but allowed the insolvent Overend Gurney and City of Glasgow
Bank to fail. And in 1890 it used a ‘lifeboat’ approach to rescue Barings which was perceived to be solvent. Note however that there is
no definitive evidence that an explicit set of Lender of Last Report (LOLR) principles was accepted by the top of the Bank and its
directors. The emergence of the Bank’s LOLR role in this period is discussed in Collins (1988), Capie (2002) and Dornbusch and
Frenkel (1984).
4
th
In the late 19 Century the banking system was relatively unregulated (and partly self-regulated) – the Bank did not have an explicit
supervisory infrastructure or system of prudential control until 1979. Nevertheless the scope of the Bank’s responsibilities was arguably
as broad then as it is now, albeit that the mix was different.

While the Bank’s responsibilities varied over the following century they remained broad and largely informal
until 1997. The transformative changes that year gave birth to a modern Bank with a narrower focus on price
stability grounded in clear statutory objectives, and with the operational independence to pursue them.
Independence was the solution to the time inconsistency problem, which causes policymakers who promise
low inflation – but then go for faster growth – to get neither. Removing political considerations from the
conduct of monetary policy made possible a credible commitment to low inflation. Strong accountability
mechanisms and transparency were put in place to legitimise that independence.

Those changes reflected the belief that price stability was the best contribution a central bank could make to
macroeconomic stability and by extension to the broader public good. This represented a deconstruction of
the old model of central banking.5

In my view, while there were enormous innovations of enduring value during this period, the reductionist
vision of a central bank’s role that was adopted around the world was fatally flawed.

In particular, it failed to recognise that financial stability is as important an objective of macroeconomic policy
as price stability, and it downplayed the interrelationships between the two.

And it failed to recognise that central banks have a vital role to play in maintaining financial stability because
of the deep underlying connection between it and monetary stability. Both are fundamentally about
maintaining the public trust and confidence in money and financial intermediation that are essential for them
to oil the wheels of commerce. That trust and confidence can be undermined through a loss of certainty
about the future value of money, a loss of confidence in financial intermediaries, or ultimately a loss of faith in
the financial system.

Central banks have a primordial responsibility to act as guarantors of trust and confidence in money because
of their status as monopoly issuers of currency. This naturally gives them control over the quantity of money
and interest rates – monetary policy. It also means that a core part of financial stability policy – acting as
lender of last resort to private financial institutions at times of financial stress – falls naturally to central
banks.

Other instruments of financial stability policy seek to prevent the build-up of vulnerabilities in the first place.
Microprudential supervision aims to maintain the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions by
ensuring they are adequately capitalised and have sufficiently resilient funding and liquidity. Macroprudential
policy seeks to safeguard the stability and resilience of the financial system as a whole both by using
prudential policy for macroeconomic ends – for example in managing the financial cycle – and by addressing

risks related to structural features of financial institutions and markets. In the latter regard, the priorities
range from ending too big to fail to improving the resilience of financial market infrastructure.

The Bank of England has now been tasked by Parliament with operating these prudential tools. Our broad
range of responsibilities now include: supervision and regulation of financial market infrastructures; acting as
lender and market maker of last resort; the design and operation of macroprudential tools; recommendations
on core elements of financial reform; and the resolution of failing financial institutions.

A return to a broad role is welcome.

The best answer to the question of what the Bank of England is for is given by the original 1694 founding
charter: promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom.

That mission is timeless. The understanding of what we should do to achieve it has evolved. In 1694
promoting the good of the people meant financing a war with France. During the Great Moderation, it meant
price stability. Today, reflecting the lessons of the ensuing financial crisis, it means maintaining both
monetary and financial stability.

We don’t intend to fail.

Going back 320 years to refresh our purpose is part of building on the best of our history, but we are not
seeking to reconstruct the central bank of the past. Instead through our strategic plan we are building the
21st Century central bank.

Here’s how.

One Bank: complementarities, synergies and economies of scope

The broad range of responsibilities we have been given creates the potential to exploit the complementarities
and synergies between them.

It is our duty to do so because the effectiveness of each function influences that of the others. In other
words, we have to maximise our impact by working together.

That imperative is the core of our new strategic plan which stresses that our contribution to the public good
will be greatest if we work as One Bank.

Complementarities might be operational, arising when putting two functions together is more efficient by
allowing faster decision making in a crisis, improving the coherence of communication, or taking advantage
of the common skills, information or analyses required to operate the policies.6

Or they might be economic, arising when there are strong interactions in the way the policies have their
effect, or when one policy affects another. It then makes more sense to have them operated by one
institution so that shared analysis and information leads to consistency of decision making and so that
trade-offs between objectives can be managed effectively, and in a timely manner, to achieve better
outcomes.

There are strong complementarities between all four of the core functions of the Bank: monetary policy,
markets, macroprudential policy and microprudential regulation.7 Each affects overall monetary and financial
conditions and therefore has the capacity to affect the achievement of both monetary and financial stability.
They in turn help maintain confidence in the currency, which we also support by issuing high-quality
banknotes that people can use with confidence. More generally we are conscious that everything we do
affects the trust and confidence in the Bank and by extension the financial system.

Monetary and macroprudential policy

The interaction between macroprudential and monetary policy is central to the Bank’s success in achieving
its dual objectives of monetary and financial stability.

The case for discharging these responsibilities in a coordinated way is very strong.

I am delighted that Ben Broadbent has today been appointed as the next Deputy Governor for
Monetary Policy. In that role, he will be central to co-ordinating these functions and his experience in
academia, financial markets, and as an external Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member, makes him
extremely well qualified to do so.

The transmission channels of monetary and prudential policy overlap, particularly in their impact on banks’
balance sheets and credit supply and demand – and hence the wider economy.8 Monetary policy affects
the resilience of the financial system, and macroprudential policy tools that affect leverage influence credit
growth and the wider economy.

6

Decision-making should be quicker with fewer agencies involved, and when trade-offs can be internalised rather than being subject to
negotiation.
7
Blinder (2010) argues that, because of economies of scope, the Federal Reserve should be both the systemic risk regulator and
should supervise because preserving financial stability is closely aligned with the objectives of monetary policy and is likely to require
lender of last resort powers.
8
Monetary policy affects banks’ balance sheets for example by changing the return on their assets; through its impact on the economic
cycle and the amount of bad loans; through its impact on credit demand; and by affecting the value of their collateral and hence funding
conditions.

In turn, financial stability is a pre-requisite for monetary stability – for example systemic banking crises are
likely to be deflationary. In reducing the frequency and severity of financial crises, macroprudential policy
therefore helps to preserve the role of money as a store of value. 9

While price and financial stability are clearly connected, achieving both can be difficult. As we saw so clearly
in the run-up to the financial crisis, the credit and business cycles operate on different time horizons, with the
former as much as twice as long and twice as big.10 In pursuing price stability, monetary policy can
contribute to the gradual build-up of financial vulnerabilities through its effect on the degree of risk-taking in
the economy.11 For example the period of low and predictable interest rates before the financial crisis helped
drive a ‘search for yield’ and leverage cycle, even with inflation subdued.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that similar risks exist today.

That tension between monetary and financial stability is best managed in a coordinated way in a single
institution. The use of macroprudential tools can decrease the need for monetary policy to be diverted from
managing the business cycle towards managing the credit cycle. This enhances the credibility of the inflation
target. That in turn may reduce the need for sharp or persistent moves in interest rates, which themselves
might threaten financial stability.

Similarly, macroprudential policy can more effectively focus on its primary goal of systemic stability by
recognising that, while it affects the economic cycle, it is not suited to managing it. Instead its effects on the
economic cycle should – like fiscal policy – be taken into account in setting monetary policy, which is the
primary and most effective tool of demand management.

Taken together with the synergies from sharing information and analysis, these are strong arguments for
operating monetary policy and prudential policy in the same institution. In the short time the Bank has been
responsible for both, we have already seen the benefits of operating them in a coordinated way.

For example, our forward guidance framework for monetary policy reflects a clear division of responsibilities.
Although monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, it does so only as
a last line of defence.

This is important because vulnerabilities can emerge from a long period of unusually low interest rates, as
complacency sets in about the future path of policy and asset prices. There have been signs of such
behaviour across the housing markets in advanced economies. In anticipation of similar risks arising in the
UK the Bank’s MPC and FPC have met jointly to review them. The FPC has identified a graduated range of

macroprudential tools available to it for a coherent, proportionate response to these risks, and has taken
initial, prudent steps. As the housing market evolves and macroprudential policy responds the FPC and
MPC will continue to work together to understand the collective impact of measures on residual
vulnerabilities and macroeconomic outcomes.

That co-ordination, the shared monitoring of risks, and clarity over the FPC’s tools allows monetary policy to
keep Bank Rate as low as necessary for as long as appropriate in order to support the recovery and maintain
price stability. For example expectations of the future path of interest rates – and hence longer-term
borrowing costs – have not risen as the housing market has begun to recover quickly.

Macroprudential and microprudential policy

There is also a natural complementarity between macro and microprudential policy because, in essence,
macroprudential policy uses prudential policy tools for macroeconomic ends, specifically the mitigation of
risks that could in time undermine price and financial stability.12 So the two will often operate through the
same channels – albeit towards different objectives.

Those objectives are themselves generally mutually reinforcing. While ensuring the safety and soundness of
individual institutions is not sufficient for systemic stability, it surely helps.13 Meanwhile macroprudential
policy seeks to reduce systemic risks and in doing so is likely to improve the resilience of individual firms.14

At times there may be a conflict. This is most likely to arise at a turning point in the cycle when
macroprudential policy – perhaps in pursuit of its secondary objective to support growth and employment –
may mandate a loosening of capital requirements in order to support credit supply and broader economic
conditions. A microprudential supervisor at the same time may understandably be more concerned to
maintain large capital buffers. The question best answered in a single institution is which dominates – risks
from a paradox of thrift or those from weakened institutions?

The obvious overlaps in tools and objectives mean that combining the two arms of prudential policy in one
organisation makes sense. That will also help to share knowledge and expertise, and to help avoid
conflicting messages to firms. And, to the extent conflicts occur, they are likely to best be resolved within a
single institution through shared analysis and mutual understanding of reaction functions.15
12

For example, the Basel III framework for capital regulation combines microprudential and macroprudential elements. Tougher
minimum requirements and institution-specific add-ons will be the responsibility of microprudential supervision. The system-wide
counter-cyclical buffer will be the responsibility of macroprudential policy.
13
In a concentrated banking system such as the UK’s the resilience of a subset of large institutions has a disproportionate effect on the
resilience of the system. One might think that microprudential regulation is then enough to guarantee systemic stability. But that is not
so when there are systemic externalities or financial accelerator effects. The latter operate through feedbacks in the macroeconomy,
and would depend (among other things) in the short run on the response of monetary policy. A macroprudential authority – with a
macroeconomic viewpoint – therefore complements microprudential supervision even in a concentrated banking system.
14
See Bank of England (2009) for a discussion.
15
Blinder (2010) makes this argument in the context of potential conflicts between safety and soundness considerations and monetary
policy.

Our strategy will be to conduct supervision as an integrated part of the central bank and not as a standalone
supervisory agency that happens to be attached to a central bank.

The benefits that close cooperation can bring were demonstrated in 2013 as the PRA and the FPC worked
closely together to bring clarity both to banks’ existing capital positions, and the standards expected of them.
The FPC mandated the exercise with a view to establishing a system-wide, transparent standard of
resilience that would boost confidence and allow the banking system to contribute to economic recovery.
The PRA – under Andrew Bailey’s leadership – delivered the recommendation for each of the major
institutions. The resulting increase in capital ensured the core of the financial system was on a sound footing
and made an important contribution to securing economic recovery.

There were clearly lessons to learn from that exercise, most notably the importance of clarity of early
communication by the Bank to financial institutions about the standards to which they would be held. Those
lessons are being applied now in the first of the Bank’s annual stress-testing exercises, which will bring
together the microprudential standards for banks with a macroprudential assessment of the risks to which
they must be resilient.

As with monetary policy, expectations matter and the system will be more resilient if the Bank’s moves can
be anticipated.

Market operations and prudential policy

The synergies I have identified so far explain why it makes sense for monetary policy and prudential policies
to be operated by a single institution, but there are also complementarities between prudential policy and the
way a central bank uses its balance sheet and controls the supply of high-powered money.

The design and operation of our liquidity facilities have important synergies with prudential policy. The terms
on which we supply liquidity in times of stress affects the level of self-insurance banks choose. If we are too
strict, banks have to over-insure at significant cost by holding an excess of low-yielding liquid assets rather
than loans, and markets will freeze too quickly in crises. But overly permissive terms create a moral hazard
risk in the form of banks running excessive liquidity mismatches in normal times.16 Prudential supervisors
can mitigate the moral hazard risk by imposing minimum liquidity requirements. But there is no point in
setting those requirements at a very high level when the central bank is prepared to lend freely against good
collateral to solvent institutions.

So it is important to coordinate liquidity requirements and banks’ reliance on liquidity insurance from the
Bank of England. Striking an efficient balance is most likely when responsibility for prudential policy also lies

with the central bank.17 And it explains why we are announcing management changes today to enhance that
coordination, with Paul Fisher – the Bank’s Executive Director for Markets – moving to become Deputy Head
of the PRA.

The Bank exploited those synergies in August 2013 when, recognising the greater availability of liquidity
insurance provided through our facilities, and banks’ improved capitalisation, we reduced the required level
of banks’ liquid asset holdings to help support lending to the real economy.

And in October last year we overhauled our facilities, offering money and collateral for longer terms against a
wider range of assets, at lower cost. We could do so because, as both supervisor and provider of liquidity
insurance, we can manage any resulting moral hazard risk.18 More importantly these changes recognise and
support the evolution of markets and the growing importance of collateral that in turn stems from financial
reform. We have the opportunity through the design of our facilities to help support more diverse forms of
finance and more resilient markets – to the benefit of financial stability.

There is another important operational complementarity. The Bank can use supervisory information and
insight to make quicker, better informed judgements about whether to lend to banks at times of crisis.19

It is clear that there is a strong case for central banks to have a broad role. Monetary and financial stability
are core objectives of macroeconomic policy, and central banks are uniquely well positioned to contribute to
their achievement. There are significant complementarities between the broad range of the Bank’s policy
responsibilities, and that has already translated into significant mutually reinforcing support to the UK
economic recovery.

Our strategic plan cements our commitment to work as One Bank to exploit those synergies. It breaks down
barriers between areas within the Bank through a reorganisation that puts greater emphasis on joint working
and moves key senior staff between areas; it aids staff movement between areas by promoting a unified
culture; it sweeps away a proliferation of internal committees that held up decision-making; and it gives
responsibility to the new Chief Economist and Governors both for a coordinated research agenda spanning
all aspects of central banking and focusing in particular on the intersections between policy areas, and for
ensuring the Bank makes better use of the data we have across the organisation in tackling all of the policy
challenges we face.

International engagement to shape an open global system

In an era of renewed globalisation securing monetary and financial stability requires more than a purely
domestic focus. To realise globalisation’s promise and deliver strong, sustainable and balanced growth,
policymakers must re-build an open, integrated and resilient global financial system. As the leading global
financial centre, the UK will be central to this task. There are two elements that are particularly important.

First, the Bank of England’s actions will help shape the functioning of core markets. The combination of the
eventual exit from Quantitative Easing and new liquidity regulations will shape demand for central bank
reserves. A host of financial reforms, such as those to derivative markets, will fundamentally change the role
of collateral, to which the Bank of England’s facilities must respond. And most fundamentally, given the
serious issues raised by the Libor and foreign exchange scandals, changes must be made to both the hard
and soft infrastructure of core markets to ensure they are fair, effective and efficient.

These are massive issues which require focus, discipline and innovation. Those are some of the reasons
why we have created a new Deputy Governor role for Markets and Banking and why my colleagues and I are
thrilled that Minouche Shafik has accepted this extraordinarily important task. Minouche brings immense
international, managerial and economic experience from a career that has spanned academia, the public
service and the IMF. She will help lead the Bank’s efforts to reshape core markets and the Bank’s
relationship to them.

Second, through its intellectual leadership and international relationships, the Bank can help complete the
G20’s ambitious programme of financial reform including building resilient financial institutions, ending too
big to fail, making derivative markets safer and transforming shadow banking to market based finance.
Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the original architects of the Financial Stability Board, is leading this effort. The job is
too big for one person and requires a well-resourced and focused international strategy that draws on all
areas of the Bank. That is why we are pooling our prudential policy teams in a single directorate and
bringing together our international teams to increase insight and impact.

By acting as One Bank we can increase our international impact and ensure that the UK’s financial sector
can be both a global good and a national asset.

Building on the success of the past 25 years

On the face of it the recent enlargement in the Bank’s responsibilities represents a return to the broader role
of the Bank of the past. If there are some similarities in roles, how we will discharge them will be
fundamentally different. The age of informal responsibilities, nods, winks, secrecy and instinct is long past.20
20

That approach is perhaps best captured by Montagu Norman’s remark in 1930 when pressed by the Macmillan Committee to explain
the Bank’s actions: “Reasons, Mr Chairman? I don’t have reasons, I have instincts”.

In no small part due to the Mais Lectures of my predecessors, particularly Mervyn King, we have today a
regime for monetary policy that is both democratically legitimate and highly effective. It rests on clear
ultimate objectives delegated by Parliament, on sound governance arrangements to support independence,
and on transparency of policymaking.

We are extending this sound framework with our strategic plan. We will reinforce these foundations in
monetary policy. And we will broaden them to financial stability.

The case for the independent operation of monetary policy is firmly established around the
time-inconsistency of governments with horizons dictated by the electoral cycle. That time-inconsistency
argument applies even more strongly to both microprudential and macroprudential policy given the large
potential size and long duration of credit cycles. The avoidance of potentially unpopular measures to boost
the resilience of the financial system today can have disastrous consequences many years later. Moreover,
being tough and avoiding crises has no obvious reward. It is hard to be given credit for a counterfactual.

The Bank’s independence must be supported by good governance arrangements. Now that Parliament has
developed them, we must make them work. The model used for monetary policy of decisions being made by
a committee made up of both Bank of England executives and independent experts has been expanded to
financial stability with the creation of both a Financial Policy Committee and a Board of
Prudential Regulation. As I have argued, those policy committees will be more effective if they have access
to the broadest range of the Bank’s analysis and information and are as well informed as possible about
each other’s reaction function.

The now very wide range of the Bank’s responsibilities also creates a need to strengthen the oversight
arrangements for the Bank as a whole. For delivery of our statutory objectives, the Bank is accountable to
the public, through Parliament’s Treasury Committee. That accountability is being reinforced.

Parliament has created an Oversight Committee of 8 non-executives who are in the Bank but not of the
Bank. The Government has today announced the appointment of Anthony Habgood to lead the Bank’s
Court of Directors and the Oversight Committee. I welcome the appointment of someone of his depth and
breadth of corporate experience. Independent oversight by the committee he will chair can strengthen the
Bank’s legitimacy and effectiveness.

The Oversight Committee has access to internal papers, is able to observe meetings of policy committees,
and is responsible for reviewing all aspects of the conduct of the Executive of the Bank, including the delivery
of policy, the design of and adherence to rigorous processes and procedures, and the monitoring of our
transparency and openness. Modelled on the Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF, we will create a unit
to support this, with a director reporting to the Chairman of the Oversight Committee.

It is not just our governance but also our commitment to transparency and openness that must be further
enhanced.

Transparency and openness are central not just to our legitimacy to perform these new tasks on behalf of the
citizens of the United Kingdom. They are also central to our effectiveness in performing them. Just as
Governor King described in his Mais Lecture 9 years ago, openness about what policy is seeking to achieve
can make it more effective.21

In monetary policy, that helps to anchor inflation expectations and to support countercyclical movements in
the policy setting. To that end, we have introduced forward guidance to reduce uncertainty about the way
monetary policy will be set as the recovery gains pace. Our Inflation Report has evolved in the past year to
contain more information about the key judgements underlying our forecasts and to widen the set of
economic indicators for which we publish forecasts to include the labour market, components of GDP, the
world economy and household incomes and saving.

It will evolve further, including using our new organisational structure to draw stronger distinctions between
staff and MPC forecasts. We will also review the case for releasing transcripts of our policy meetings after
some years, and report publicly to the Oversight and Treasury Select Committees on the outcome of that
review.

Through our strategic plan, we will also increase the transparency of our work on financial stability. We will
publish the results of regular bank stress tests. As with monetary policy, we also intend to publish more of
the research and analysis underlying our policy choices. Over time, the financial sector will be better placed
to anticipate our responses and as with monetary policy, increased transparency will make us not just
accountable, but also more effective.

Conclusion

The first Mais Lectures launched the fight against inflation. With time and increased confidence
policymakers would win that war only to lose the peace.

As a consequence, George Osborne’s 2010 lecture heralded the return of prudential supervision and the
introduction of macroprudential policy to the Bank of England. Today’s challenge is to create a
macroeconomic environment that provides the basis for strong, sustainable and balanced growth, the
economist’s equivalent of a land fit for heroes.

This evening I have sketched how the Bank of England intends to makes its contribution. I am in no doubt
that those who come after me will add to our collective knowledge of how best to coordinate the Bank’s vast
array of policy levers to achieve our fundamental mission. An open and confident Bank will welcome such
advice and criticism.

Why? Because the need for broad macroeconomic management is not just an intellectual curiosity, but
rather a reality that will persist for years to come.

As the MPC has signalled, a low for long interest rate environment will likely be with us for some time. The
MPC’s new guidance that any adjustments in rates, when they come, will be limited and gradual helps
provide confidence to households and businesses that the MPC won’t take risks with the recovery. This in
turn helps make the attainment of the inflation target more likely.

At the same time, policymakers across the Bank’s statutory committees are fully aware that an environment
of relatively low and predictable interest rates could encourage excessive risk taking in financial markets and
by households.22 This puts a tremendous burden on both microprudential supervision and macroprudential
management.

Moreover, the nature of a rapidly evolving global economy reinforces these pressures. Sustained
imbalances across countries, intense capital flow volatility and powerful disinflationary forces driven by the
integration of the other half of humanity into the global economy will buffet our economy and financial sector
for years to come.

The Bank can help turn those challenges into opportunities. Through the coordinated use of the Bank’s
tools, risks to monetary and financial stability can be mitigated. Through changes to the hard and soft
infrastructure of markets fair, open and competitive markets can be re-built. Through ideas and
engagement, the global financial system can be reformed to secure an open, resilient system in which all
countries have confidence and in which British businesses can thrive.
To achieve this we are building a central bank for the 21st Century that combines the finest aspects of our

the stability of our economic and financial system – will testify as to whether we have succeeded.
