‘The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable’
--John Kenneth Galbraith
1. INTRODUCTION
It is with great pleasure I come to the University of Nottingham. I’ve always been a
big fan of Robin Hood and in today’s economic climate there has been no better time
to take from the rich and give to the poor. It is well known that the marginal
propensity to consume of those on low incomes is higher than those at the top of the
income distribution. The Sheriff may not have appreciated the short-term stimulus
some of Robin’s activities may have provided to Sherwood Forest and the
Nottinghamshire economy.
In my last speech at Keynes College at the University of Kent on 29th October 2008 I
argued that the UK had entered recession, the risks of inflationary pressure were
benign and that monetary policy needed to be loosened quickly and sharply1. Since
then it has become apparent an especially severe contraction in output and
employment has taken place and is set to intensify in 2009. At the same time Bank
Rate has been cut by 3.5 percentage points (pp) since September. The question facing
policymakers now is how long and protracted the downturn may be, and what to do
about it?

The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated rapidly. We are now faced with a
synchronised downturn in most of the world’s major economies. These developments
will have a profound impact on the UK economy and raise the prospects of an
especially severe recession.

As an economy enters a recession many macroeconomic forecasters typically expect
growth to return to its trend or average rate reasonably quickly. As economic
conditions continue to deteriorate the projections for a recovery are successively
pushed further out into the future. The common assumption appears to be that the
underlying forces putting downward pressure on economic activity, which we often

1

D.G. Blanchflower (2009), 'Where next for the UK economy?', Scottish Journal of Political
Economy, forthcoming, February

1

have a poor understanding of, are likely to dissipate. But often these shocks to
economic activity are more prolonged than anyone expects. We must not be over
optimistic.

Rather, we must allow ourselves to consider the possibility that the UK will
experience a prolonged period of poor economic performance. Although it is a
desirable expectation, there is little evidence to suggest this recession will be less
painful than that in the early 1990s. Perhaps the current recession will be even more
severe?

With Bank Rate at a historic low of 1.5% we must consider the options available to
monetary policy makers in case we approach the zero bound in the near future. In this
speech I will argue that the Bank of England has a range of tools available to provide
an effective monetary stimulus to the economy, even at the zero bound.

2. HOW BAD IS THE DOWNTURN SO FAR?
To understand how long and deep the current UK recession may be we need to
understand when it began. The source of the current recession can be traced to the
unsustainable rises in lending, bond, equity and house prices and compression of risk
premia that have been evident since the start of decade across many developed
economies. Indeed, the FTSE100 has fallen back to levels similar to those in 2003 and
the Standard & Poors 500 share index had declined to its lowest level since 1997.

The current economic climate emerged from the bursting of these many bubbles, with
the UK economy featuring prominently, but which started around the beginning of
2007 in the US sub-prime mortgage market. The global nature of the financial
markets meant the re-appraisal of risk in the United States quickly reverberated
around the world into other developed and developing economies.

When did the UK economy begin to contract? GDP growth was flat in 2008Q2 for the
first time in 16 years and contracted in 2008Q3 by 0.6%, and by 1.5% in the final
quarter of the year, the sharpest rate of decline since 1980. The National Institute for

2

Economic and Social Research (NIESR) calculates monthly estimates for UK GDP.
These estimates indicate the recession began around May 2008.

In the United States recessions are dated by the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER). The NBER indicate the US recession began in December 2007
when non-farm payrolls began to fall2. On that basis we can date the start of the UK
recession as six months later as UK employment started to fall, quite sharply, from
April 2008 (Table 1). Both ILO unemployment and the claimant count also started to
rise in April 2008. Furthermore, private sector wage growth began to slow from its
already benign levels, from around the spring of 2008.

There had also been a rapid slowing in a number of qualitative measures relating to
the labour market from early 2008: the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply
(CIPS) employment surveys peaked in March, the Recruitment and Employment
Confederation (REC) survey balance for permanent placements peaked in March and
the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) employment survey peaked in the final
quarter of 2007 (see Charts 1-3). Together these employment surveys point to around
April last year as the beginning of the recession.

What do the most recent data tell us about the near term outlook? A range of surveys
measuring economic output fell through Q4 to historic lows. Industrial production
declined by 6.9% in the year to November, the weakest annual growth rate since
1981. The Experian survey balance for activity in the construction sector fell to a
record low in October. Similarly, the CIPS scores for activity in the manufacturing
and services sectors fell very sharply to historic lows in Q4 (Chart 4).

However, the bad news doesn’t end there. Forward looking surveys suggest the
severity of the recession will sharpen in 2009. The CIPS surveys for orders have
fallen even more sharply than those for output. This is consistent with the GFK
measure of consumer confidence which remains weaker than at any time since the
survey began in the 1970s. Strikingly the BCC surveys of confidence in turnover have
fallen sharply below any previous reading. These surveys provided a warning signal

that output was likely to contract in the 1990s recession. The Banks Agents’ scores
for investment intentions in both the manufacturing and services sectors have fallen to
lower levels than at any time since the surveys began in 1997 (Chart 5). In summary,
the survey evidence indicates the contraction in UK GDP is likely to continue in
2009.

In the early 1990s recession, growth was initially supported by a relatively robust
European economy. In part, this largely reflected the strength of the post-reunification
boom in Germany. This time around many commentators had hoped that demand in
emerging economies such as China could support global growth.

It is now clear a synchronised global downturn has begun. Investment and trade have
slowed across both developed economies and emerging markets. Growth in the third
quarter was negative in the United States, euro area and Japan, and survey evidence
for these economies indicates that the pace of contraction is likely to accelerate in the
fourth quarter.

In Germany, provisional estimates indicate calendar year GDP growth was 1.3% in
2008, implying the economy shrank by around 1.5% to 2.0% in the final quarter. Euro
area industrial production had fallen by 3.1% in the three months to November, the
largest decline since the series began in 1990. The euro area manufacturing and
services purchasing manager indices (PMIs) fell to historic lows in December, and
remained at similar levels in January. So the contraction in euro area output is likely
to accelerate sharply in 2008Q4 and continue in 2009Q1.

The deterioration in US economic conditions has been staggering. In December, nonfarm payrolls fell by 524,000 on the month, and have fallen by over 1 million since
October. In the year to December US manufacturing output had suffered its largest
decline since 1975. The output and new orders subcomponents of the Institute for
Supply Management (ISM) survey are at their lowest level since 1950. Developments
in the construction and housing markets remain bleak. In December the number of
newly started dwellings and newly authorised construction permits fell to an all time
low since the series were first recorded in 1959.

4

It is now clear that growth is receding in the Asian economies. GDP growth in China
has fallen to it lowest level since 2001 and the growth of industrial production is at the
lowest level since 19953. In the fourth quarter GDP in South Korea and Singapore fell
by 5.6% and 4.4% respectively. In December, nominal Japanese exports had fallen by
an astonishing 35.0% on the year. It is clear that the Asian economies are unlikely to
sustain global demand going forward.

The synchronised nature of the current downturn should not be too surprising. We do
not live in a decoupled global economy. Rather, economies are now more greatly
integrated through trade and financial market linkages than in the past. And
deteriorating financial market conditions are hitting the developing economies too.
Sharp declines in international bond issuance by, and syndicated loans to, emerging
market firms has cast doubt on their ability to maintain capital spending. The flow of
credit is reported to have dried up in several countries given the risk of lending as
international trade shrinks.

The slowdown in world demand is having a clear dis-inflationary effect. Input costs
and output price inflation have fallen back across many economies. Crude oil,
commodity prices and the cost of shipping raw materials have fallen precipitously.
The Baltic Dry index, a measure of shipping costs for raw materials, has fallen by
around 95% since its peak in May. According to shipping journal Lloyd's List
‘brokers in Singapore are now waiving fees for containers travelling from South
China, charging only for the minimal "bunker" costs. Container fees from North Asia
have dropped $200, taking them below operating cost.’

At the same time measures of consumer price inflation have declined. In the euro area
annual HICP has fallen from a peak of 4.0% in July to just 1.6% in December, US
annual CPI inflation has fallen from a peak of 5.6% in July to 0.1% in December. The
fall in US CPI inflation, coupled with the broader deterioration in the economic
outlook, has prompted significant macroeconomic policy responses. The US Federal
Reserve has cut interest rates to close to the zero bound and President Obama’s
administration has planned a substantial fiscal stimulus.

In its most recent projections published yesterday the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) now expects world GDP growth to be just 0.5% in 2009. The US economy is
expected to contract by 1.6%, euro area by 2.0% and UK by 2.8% in 2009. If realised
these projections would constitute the slowest level of world GDP growth, and
biggest contraction of the UK economy, since World War 2.

Even without the rapidly deteriorating domestic outlook, the slowdown in the world
economy would pose a stern challenge for the UK. Given that UK output and
employment have already started to contract, the lack of support from external
demand suggests the UK recession will be all the more severe.

3. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM PAST RECESSIONS
The last two recessions occurred in the early 1990s and 1980s. During these periods
GDP contracted for five successive quarters, and it took over three years for output to
gradually recover to its pre-recession level (Chart 6). So if past recessions are any
guide UK GDP is likely to continue contracting until at least the second half of 2009.

Previous recessions have varied substantially in the severity and duration of their
effects on the labour market. The unemployment rate rose for four years following the
first oil shock in the early 1970s, from 3.4% to 5.7% and by 5.5pp between 1980 and
1982, remaining in double figures until 1987. The unemployment rate rose for 3 years
in the early 1990s rising by 3.8pp and only fell back to its pre-recession level by the
end of 1997. So the current deterioration in labour market conditions is likely to
persist for the foreseeable future.

Past recessions may have led to adverse effects on the supply potential of the
economy. Long-term unemployment, particularly at a young age, is damaging to
future labour market prospects both for the individuals involved and the economy as a
whole. Workers may lose their skills, causing a loss of human capital. High rates of
unemployment may mean there is a mismatch between those skills that workers
possess and those for which there is demand within the economy. People may also be
less likely to participate in the labour market the longer their spell of unemployment
persists.

6

Sustained unemployment while young, especially of long duration, has particularly
nasty effects. By preventing labour market entrants from gaining a foothold in
employment sustained youth unemployment may reduce their productivity. A range
of evidence indicates those that suffer youth unemployment have lower incomes and
poorer labour market experiences decades later4. These are important lessons for any
measures that may be taken to address higher unemployment in the near future.

Thus far, there has been little increase in long-term unemployment. But this problem
may emerge as the downturn becomes more acute. Worryingly, unemployment of
those aged 18-24 years increased by 55,000 in the three months to November, around
40% of the total increase in unemployment over the same period.

One feature of recessions is that macroeconomic forecasters fail to appreciate their
length and depth. Chart 7 illustrates the real-time Consensus forecasts for UK GDP
growth in each calendar year over the period around the time of the last recession5.
Here, each line illustrates a stream of forecasts for GDP growth in a particular
calendar year. The x-axis illustrates the point in real time when each projection was
made, and the y-axis the projection itself6.

So the very first point in the pink line indicates that the first forecasts for 1991, which
were made at the beginning of 1990, were for growth of around 2%. But over time
these forecasts were revised down, eventually to around -2%. And even when UK
output was expected to contract by around 2% in 1991, economic forecasters still
expected growth to recovery quickly in 1992.

Institutions have proved little better at anticipating economic slowdowns. Charts 3
and 4 illustrate a broadly similar pattern of forecast revisions from the Organisation
for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and NIESR projections. There
was no mention at all of the word 'recession' in the Monetary Policy Committee's

August 2008 Inflation Report. The central projection was for output to be "broadly
flat over the next year or so, after which growth gradually recovers" (p.5).

Perhaps economists tend to under-predict the magnitude of recessions because the
underlying adverse shock to economic activity is assumed to have largely run its
course. This leads macroeconomic forecasters to expect growth to gradually recover
towards its trend or average rate at any given time. Few forecasters expect the adverse
influences on economic activity, and the responses of households and firms to them,
to intensify.

This is understandable as we do not possess a good understanding of the forces that
drive cyclical upturns and downturns, the ‘animal spirits’ as Keynes referred to them.
Of course, many economists would attribute their forecast errors to apparently
unprecedented events that cause economic prospects to deteriorate rapidly. For
example, the accounting scandals in early part of this decade or the collapse of
Lehman Brothers investment bank.

That these unexpected events happen so regularly, particularly within the financial
sector, has not led us to anticipate them more frequently. Furthermore, there appears
to be confusion between cause and effect. The collapse of Lehman Brothers was
clearly the result, not the cause, of the deterioration in the US sub-prime housing
market and the deterioration in global financial market conditions.

Of course, economic output in the UK, and in many other economies, had started to
contract long before the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank. Perhaps
the significance of this event was that it brought forward a realisation and acceleration
of the necessary adjustment within the financial sector.

In summary, if past recessions are any guide they suggest the current contraction in
UK economic activity is likely to continue for some time with output recovering only
gradually thereafter. A key lesson for macroeconomic policy makers is that there is a
danger of under estimating the length and depth of the recession. We must consider

8

the policy options to address the plausible possibility that the UK will now experience
a recession as severe as the one that hit the UK so hard in the early 1980s.

4. WHAT DOES ECONOMICS TELL US?
In considering the likely causes, magnitude and persistence of the current recession
and the appropriate monetary and fiscal policy responses, I would have liked to offer
you some insightful observations from the cutting edge of modern macroeconomic
research. It may surprise non-technical economists that the standard assumption in
economic research is that the financial sector has priced all assets efficiently at all
times in the past, and will continue to do so over the infinite future. In fact, for all
intents and purposes the financial sector barely exists or is omitted from many
economic models. It is as if developments in the financial sector only had an impact
on the economy in a crude distant past, such as the 1930s or 1970s, in which neither
money markets nor monetary policy were properly understood.

Hence, it is a sad indictment of the economics profession that few macroeconomists
actually spotted the greatest financial crisis in a hundred years. Rather, many
macroeconomists believed such a possibility was highly unlikely, in fact we had
apparently entered a period of ‘great stability’, and research priorities have been
shaped accordingly. The1995 Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas Jr. in his presidential
address to the American Economic Association states,
"Macroeconomics was born as a distinct field in the 1940's, as a part of
the intellectual response to the Great Depression. The term then
referred to the body of knowledge and expertise that we hoped would
prevent the recurrence of that economic disaster. My thesis in this
lecture is macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded: its
central problem of depression prevention has been solved, for all
practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades". R.E.
Lucas, The American Economic Review, March 2003, pp. 1-14.
The 2008 Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman noted in the New York Times on January 4th,
2009, citing the Lucas quote above.
"We weren't supposed to find ourselves in this situation. For many
years most economists believed that preventing another Great
Depression would be easy... It turns out, however, that preventing
depressions isn't that easy after all..... Friedman’s claim that monetary

9

policy could have prevented the Great Depression was an attempt to
refute the analysis of John Maynard Keynes, who argued that monetary
policy is ineffective under depression conditions and that fiscal policy
— large-scale deficit spending by the government — is needed to fight
mass unemployment. The failure of monetary policy in the current
crisis shows that Keynes had it right the first time".
Some economists have celebrated the triumph of economic theory in modern
macroeconomic research.
“Over the last three decades, macroeconomic theory and the practice of
macroeconomics by economists have changed — for the better.
Macroeconomics is now firmly grounded in the principles of economic
theory.” Chari and Kehoe (2006).7
I disagree that this is an improvement. Macroeconomics has had little to say about the
current astonishing events in the financial markets and global economy.
Macroeconomic research and theory should principally be concerned with explaining
events in the real world, not vice versa. Fortunately I am in good company. Nobel
Laureate Robert Solow, for example, has recently criticized the ‘state of macro’
because it is not well grounded in the data.8
“The other possible defence of modern macro is that, however special
it may seem, it is justified empirically. This too strikes me as a
delusion. In fact “modern macro” has been notable for paying very
little rigorous attention to data. …... I am left with the feeling that there
is nothing in the empirical performance of these models that could
come close to overcoming a modest scepticism. And more certainly,
there is nothing to justify reliance on them for serious policy analysis”.
Solow, 2008, p.245 (our italics).
Perhaps, the best I can offer you is an event analysis of past financial market crises by
Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) who find that financial crises have "deep and lasting
effects on asset prices, output and employment".9 More often than not, they argue,
the aftermath of severe financial crises share three characteristics. First, asset market
collapses are deep and prolonged. Real house prices decline on average by 35% over

a period of six years, while equity prices fall on average by 55% over a period of three
and a half years. Second, the unemployment rate rises on average by 7 percentage
points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on average over four years.
Output falls (from peak to trough) on average by over 9%, although the duration of
the downturn, averaging roughly two years, is considerably shorter than for
unemployment. Third, the real value of government debt tends to explode, rising on
average by 86% in the major post–World War II episodes.

Clearly financial market crises pose severe challenges for policymakers. Sadly, as a
monetary policy maker myself I must admit that modern macroeconomic research is
of little in help in tackling the problems facing the UK economy.

5. THE OUTLOOK FOR CPI INFLATION
In October I argued that annual CPI inflation was set to fall back sharply from its peak
in September. Furthermore, the risk from heightened measures of inflation
expectations was benign. Rather, the risk facing the MPC was that CPI inflation might
become dislodged below the 2.0% target for a prolonged period. Given the recent falls
in CPI inflation it is now likely that the Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn
King will have to write to the Chancellor in 2009 explaining why CPI inflation is
more than 1.0pp below the 2% target.

In December CPI inflation had fallen to 3.1%, reflecting falling petrol and food
prices. As past rises in petrol prices fall out of the index annual CPI inflation is likely
to fall further. The recent declines in other commodity prices will have similar effects.
Of course, these are largely mechanical effects on the CPI index for particular items
whose prices have already fallen sharply. But there is likely to be a broader degree of
dis-inflationary pressure within the economy. As demand weakens the degree of spare
capacity within firms will rise, putting further downward pressure on consumer
prices.

This dis-inflationary pressure is evident in firm’s expected prices. Table 2 illustrates
that all of the surveys of firm’s pricing intentions have fallen back over the recent
past. Chart 10 illustrates the Banks Agent’s scores for spare capacity within firms in

11

the manufacturing and services sectors, which have fallen to their lowest level since
the survey began in 1997.

Chart 11 illustrates survey measures of household’s inflation expectations have fallen
back even more sharply than the CPI inflation rate. This is consistent with the survey
evidence from the Bank/NOP survey that household’s expectations of future inflation
are now below their perceptions of current inflation (Chart 12).

These revised expectations may be because households now understand that a
protracted period of weak economic activity is likely. And if households expect
unemployment to rise they are likely to lower their wage demands. Indeed, wage
growth as measured by both the AEI and AWE measures has fallen back from the
levels recorded in early 2008 (Chart 13).

One risk to the medium term outlook for CPI inflation is the depreciation of Sterling
which could potentially push up on the price of imported goods and service. However,
the extent to which the Sterling depreciation puts upward pressure on UK import
prices depends on the pricing decisions of foreign firms that export to the UK. It is
quite likely that these firms will choose to squeeze their profit margins rather than
raise their Sterling prices, and risk losing UK market share. This is all the more likely
at a time when UK demand is depressed.

Similarly, British firms facing higher import costs may choose to lower their profit
margins rather than raise the prices they charge to consumers. Indeed, research by the
Bank of England indicates that British firms tend to reduce their profit margins when
demand is weak10.

Those items where changes in the Sterling exchange rate do feed quickly into the
prices that British households pay include food and energy prices. And the falling
global prices for these products will offset the upward pressure from the Sterling

10

Clare Macallan, Stephen Millard and Miles Parker, Bank of England Working Paper No 351.

12

depreciation. For example, the Sterling price of crude oil has more than halved since
the summer of 2008.

These arguments may explain the difficulty in establishing any robust statistical
relationship between movements in the Sterling exchange rate and CPI inflation. The
sterling depreciation may imply a rise in the relative price of imported goods and
services, but not necessarily upward pressure on aggregate CPI inflation. CPI inflation
is likely to fall below the 2.0% target in 2009 because of the weakness of UK demand,
but within the overall CPI basket the relative price of some imported goods may rise.

Will recent cuts in Bank rate will be sufficient to ensure that CPI inflation returns to
target in the medium term? A key risk is that the contraction in UK GDP may be
sufficiently prolonged, with CPI inflation moving close to or below zero, so that
inflation expectations become dislodged below the 2.0% target. In short, the MPC
must consider the risk that the UK could experience deflation. Indeed it is very likely
than some measures of retail prices, such as RPI, which include housing costs and
interest payments, will fall into negative territory in the first half of 2009.

6. MONETARY POLICY RESPONSES
With Bank rate at 1.5% the MPC has considered the options available should we
eventually come to a point where we are close to or at the zero bound. That said, it is
by no means certain that Bank rate will eventually be cut to zero.

In the literature concerning monetary policy at the zero bound much has been made of
the difficulty for monetary authorities to credibly commit to accommodative policy in
the future so that long-term bond yields fall. Here, the inflation target is an excellent
tool for the MPC. As long as monetary policy remains credible, market participants
will expect policy to remain sufficiently loose so as to meet the inflation target in the
medium term.

Potential policy measures at the zero bound include a central bank making open
market purchases of government securities and gilts, which increase the supply of
bank reserves and put downward pressure on the rate that clears the reserves market.

13

If Bank rate eventually reaches the zero bound the MPC may decide as an instrument
of monetary policy to boost the overall supply of money in such a fashion. So even if
we do eventually reach the zero bound, which is not certain, the MPC will still have
additional tools to stimulate the economy.

A key reason the Bank of England has considered unconventional policy measures is
that the transmission of monetary policy has become impaired. Many money markets
that had been key sources of funding have been effectively closed. Widening credit
spreads and more restrictive lending standards as part of the de-leveraging process
within the financial sector have led to tighter credit conditions overall, despite falls in
Bank rate. This was evident from the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey which
indicated that lenders had tightened, and expected to continue tightening credit to both
households and firms.

There are policy measures we can take to address these problems, without necessarily
cutting Bank rate to zero. When money markets are dysfunctional, asset purchases by
a central bank can help to reduce liquidity premia and restore activity and lending. I
would label these type of actions as ‘credit easing’. By changing the composition of
the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet a central bank can encourage more
favourable lending to households and firms. In contrast, the policy pursued by the
Bank of Japan in the 1990s, often referred to as ‘quantitative easing’, was primarily
focused on the quantity on bank reserves in the economy.

Such actions may be undertaken before the zero bound is reached. If successful they
may even have a greater impact on lending than cuts in Bank rate itself. A key goal of
these operations might be to restore activity in those markets where lending has
ceased and to close the gap between effective interest rates in money markets and the
official Bank rate. It should be said though that interest rates are still an effective tool:
it is clear that today’s rate of 1.5% is better than having rates at, say 5%.
In his speech on January 20th the Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King
discussed in which markets such intervention may be helpful. I agree that we need to
consider those markets that ‘normally play major roles in the functioning of the

14

financial system’ such as those as for corporate bonds where spreads have risen to
historic highs. As the Governor indicated, such action is likely in the near future. I
will not speculate further on the exact details of these actions. Rather, I would like to
point out that there are a range of policy options available to ensure that the 2.0% CPI
inflation target is met in the medium term.

7. CONCLUSION
Since September there has been considerable stimulus to the UK economy from
macroeconomic policy. The scale of these responses has been commensurate with the
magnitude of the adverse shocks hitting the economy. As poor as economic prospects
currently are the situation would have been far worse without the various policy
initiatives that have been adopted. For example, the Bank recapitalisation scheme has
clearly helped to avoid a collapse of the UK financial sector.

The unconventional measures I have described in this speech will help to address the
many remaining problems in the UK financial sector, together with other policy
initiatives recently announced by the Chancellor. A well functioning economy
requires an efficient financial system. This is not the case at present and it is not clear
when a significant improvement is likely. The recent cuts in Bank rate and stimulus
from monetary and fiscal policy must be set against this stark reality.

The widening degree of spare capacity within the economy will put downward
pressure on CPI inflation. In my view the risks of meeting the 2.0% CPI inflation
target in the medium term lie firmly on the downside. Hence, I believe monetary
policy needs to be loosened further and quickly.

Past recessions have typically been associated with five quarters of negative growth, it
has usually taken around three years to regain the pre-recession level of output and the
deterioration in labour market conditions has been even more protracted. There
appears to be little reason to expect a more favourable outcome this time around.
Moreover, international evidence indicates that financial crises have especially severe
effects on the economic outlook. There is now a plausible possibility that the current
UK recession may be even more severe than the recession in the early 1980s.

15

However, we should bear in mind that the economy will eventually recover. As
expectations are revised down there is a danger of becoming unduly pessimistic. In
the past the UK economy has proved resilient to economic shocks and there is no
reason to believe it won’t be resilient in the future. Finally, although the challenges
facing economic policy makers are stark they will eventually be overcome. I believe
the recently announced fiscal and monetary policy initiatives are a step in the right
direction. But we need to do more.
