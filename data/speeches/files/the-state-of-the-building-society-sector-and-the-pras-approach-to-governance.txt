It’s a great pleasure to be at the BSA annual conference again, and in Harrogate again. I note that
Harrogate is confirmed as “the happiest place in England!”, so I feel a certain sense of expectation by inviting
the prudential regulator to speak at the happiest place. My plan this morning is to cover two areas in my
remarks: first, an overview of our impressions of the state of the building societies as a whole; and, second,
some comments on the PRA’s approach to the governance of firms, to coincide with the publication today of
consultation of our supervisory statement on board responsibilities.

So, since we are in the happiest place in England, let me start in what I hope you will regard as an
appropriate spirit, namely that even though the environment remains one of continuing low interest rates –
and, as I always do at this point, let me stress that I am making no judgement on monetary policy
whatsoever – the aggregate net interest margin for the building societies has picked up, arrears rates on
loans remain low and net new lending has been strong over the last two years. Looking at the sector beyond
Nationwide – and I do this not to ignore Nationwide but because its size means that it has a large impact on
averages – the average Core Tier One Capital ratio at the end of last year was over 17%, and the average
leverage ratio was around 6%. The overall quality of capital is in our view in a good place and you have
taken the implementation of Basel 3/EU CRD4 in your stride.

In the four quarters to the end of last year, the societies (again not including Nationwide) contributed 22% of
net new mortgage lending in the UK, which compares with a 9% share of the stock of lending. Arrears on
first charge mortgages continue on a downward trend that we have seen for at least the last five years, and
the building society arrears rate on average is lower than the average for all mortgage loans.

All societies are meeting their liquidity requirements and quite a few of you choose to hold higher liquid asset
buffers than our requirements, which is perfectly acceptable as a choice. Access to Bank of England liquidity
facilities, which is an important form of insurance, has increased in terms of the number of societies having
reserve accounts and preparing for the use of lending facilities should that be needed at some point in the
future.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, the overall position on ratings for those societies that have them has improved.
So, it’s true, Harrogate really is the happiest place in England. Of course, I am now going to go on to talk
about risks, but before I do let me say that this sort of performance doesn’t happen by accident. But it does
show that there is a role for mutuals and one that can succeed. Of course, a lot of hard work goes into
achieving these results. On our side, I can also say that Martin Stewart and his colleagues put a lot of hard
work into our role, which is founded on sensible forward-looking judgement consistent with our objectives in
statute.
So, what can go wrong – the risks? The first area that I would highlight is the potential for margin pressure.
Most forecasters see continued growth in the mortgage market as the most likely development, but at a
lesser pace than in recent years, which is consistent with actions taken by the Bank of England last summer

to limit the growth of borrowing by highly indebted households. Competition in the mortgage market is
growing, and for instance rates on two year fixed rate mortgages are at a record low. On the liability side,
wholesale funding costs are low, and on much of the evidence they are below retail funding costs on
average, and that tends to benefit lenders with greater access to wholesale funding. Therefore,
notwithstanding the news on interest margins over the last two years, we are watching this story carefully to
see what happens next.

The second risk unfortunately follows from the first, namely that increasing pressure on interest margins can
tempt lenders to seek higher returns on assets through riskier loans, and to concentrate more on short-term
funding thereby increasing the mismatch. We saw this before the financial crisis broke in 2007 as lenders
ventured into higher LTV, sub-prime and commercial property lending without having adequate risk
management in place. We also saw this in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This diversification was
generally not successful, and in some cases fatal. Since the height of the crisis societies have generally
reduced their commercial property loans, and non-prime has declined too. The main area of growth has
been buy-to-let lending, which is true not just for societies but for lenders in general. Now, I don’t want to
demonise buy-to-let lending. We are watching carefully, and for the societies we see no evidence today that
BTL loans are of poorer quality than prime owner-occupier, and we see a fair amount of stability over time in
maximum LTV and minimum rental cover. But, we are watching carefully, and of course applying stress
testing across all loans.

Looked at more broadly, we are not seeing an upward surge in high LTV lending of the sort that was so
damaging in the past, but there is an upward direction to the – admittedly small – share of lending at high
LTV and high loan-to-income (ie the two together). We are, again, watching this carefully, and it is why in
2010 we implemented the Building Societies Sourcebook to encourage appropriate risk management of
lending and funding. The latter will be supported in future when we implement the net stable funding ratio
which is the international standard to discourage reliance on short-term funding.

We are also increasingly focussed on operational risks and the prudential implications of conduct risk, as I
know are societies. I want to pick out one area of operational risk which is important, namely IT systems
risk. One aspect of this is the cost and complexity of updating legacy IT systems in the face of growing
demands on those systems from innovation in products. Cyber risk is also very high on our list of priorities. I
recognise that not all societies have an internet presence, though I do know, of course, that you all use the
internet. We will be seeking to ensure that cyber risk is properly tackled by societies as appropriate. In
saying this, I am not seeking to pick out societies from other firms that we supervise, but we do think that
these risks are in important respects common to all firms.

Societies have generally been less affected than the large banks by conduct mis-selling costs, though not
fully immune. We are watching again very carefully, and I can assure you that as prudential regulator we
want to see sensible outcomes that balance the objectives of all parties and ensure that we maintain a stable

financial system that can support the activity of today’s customers. Nobody wants to see a world where
ex-post enforcement weakens the capacity to support economic activity, and that means we must return as
soon as possible to a world where the emphasis is on strong risk management, governance and
forward-looking supervision.

This review of risks covers much of our work programme for the year. Two other points I would note. First,
we are reviewing the Sourcebook which since the beginning of April has been called a Supervisory
Statement. The Sourcebook was first introduced in 2010 as a response to the crisis. We will consult on
changes later this year and have already had two very useful pre-consultation meetings with the BSA and a
number of societies. Let me assure you that this review is not the beginning of a major agenda to change
how we supervise societies. Rather, a lot has happened since 2010, and we think a stocktake is in order.
Second, recovery and resolution is an important focus of activity following the enactment of the EU Directive
(the BRRD). Our objective is to ensure that orderly resolution is possible should it be needed, and thus to
support our general approach that we are not a regulator that adopts a policy of no failures. We work closely
with the resolution function of the Bank of England to develop and put into effect workable resolution plans.
I said that I would also comment on the PRA’s approach to the governance of firms, so let me now turn to
that. I will start with an observation based on experience of the crisis, namely that is uncommon and rare to
find a problem in the capital or funding or business model of a firm which cannot be traced back to a failure
of governance. I don’t think this is a radical statement by any means. But it does mean that fixing capital,
liquidity, and other areas of risk do not on their own deal with all of the problem. Put another way, it would be
unwise to do all of these things and ignore governance. Good governance is critical to delivering a sound
and well-run business. At the instigation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, we are
this year implementing the new Senior Managers Regime. The key principle of that regime is to establish
clearly appropriate responsibility for the governance of firms. Put like that, it is not meant to be radical or
life-changing, despite whatever you may hear and read. We do want to avoid what the PCBS described as
the Murder on the Orient Express outcome when firms get into trouble, which is akin to the “everyone and
no-one” is responsible but everyone is connected to the event. Clarity of responsibility is I hope
unobjectionable. But this is not clarity in the sense of facilitating witch hunts. Rather, I see clarity as an
appropriate allocation of responsibility, as important to creating the right incentives for behaviour and
leadership, and of course in areas like remuneration.

In the Senior Managers Regime, responsibility at the highest level covers both executives and
non-executives. But, of course, they are different and always will be. There is much commentary, that the
response to the crisis has muddied the responsibilities of executives and non-executives, with the burden on
the latter increasing. I think there is no doubt that a greater formality is emerging around roles and
responsibilities, and I’m afraid the burden of work for non-executives has risen, we can’t hide from that. An
effective board is at the heart of good governance, ensuring that the appropriate policies are in place in
respect of safety and soundness and good conduct. We at the PRA have a strong interest in supporting

good governance and the work of board members to deliver it. An effective board is one which understands
the business, establishes a clear strategy, articulates a clear risk appetite to support that strategy, oversees
an effective risk control framework, and collectively has the skills, the experience and the confidence to hold
executive management rigorously to account for delivering that strategy and managing within that risk
appetite.

In view of the important role of boards, and the work on governance under way, today we have published for
consultation a Supervisory Statement on the responsibilities of boards. We recognise that this is a hugely
important issue, and so we thought it was sensible to set out our thinking for comment as a precursor to a
statement of our expectations. The statement clarifies our expectations of boards and indicates some of the
elements of good governance to which we expect to pay particular attention in assessing how well firms are
run. It draws on our regulatory experience and the lessons of past firm failures – including building society
ones - and will help boards to understand how we reach our judgments on governance. The statement is not
intended to be a comprehensive statement of good practice. Boards have other sources for that, such as the
Corporate Governance Code produced by the Financial Reporting Council or the Basel Corporate
Governance Principles for banks.

The statement underscores the collective responsibilities shared by board members. As such it
complements the individual accountabilities which we are introducing through the Senior Managers and
Senior Insurance Managers Regimes. Under these regimes all senior managers, including certain
non-executive directors, will be held to a clear standard of behaviour. But the primary role of all NEDs is
independent oversight and challenge of the Executive and the PRA recognises that the actual
responsibilities of NEDs within the scope of the regimes differ from those of executive Senior Managers and
they should be clarified and limited accordingly.

Key messages from the statement are:
•

it is a responsibility of boards to establish strategy, set the risk appetite and monitor risk across the

business and hold management to account;
•

the risk appetite must be clearly owned by the Board, integral to the strategy and actively used to

monitor and control risks and inform key business decisions;
•

boards should articulate and maintain a culture of risk awareness and ethical behaviour;

•

boards should include individuals with a mix of skills and experience that are up-to-date and cover

the major business areas in order to make informed decisions and provide effective oversight of the risks;
•

but this does not mean expertise in every aspect of a broad and complex financial business – the

point is to have the diversity of experience and capacity to provide effective challenge across the full range of
business;
•

boards should act in a co-operative and collegiate manner whereby the non-executives support and

encourage executive management and vice versa;

but this should not inhibit the non-executive directors from challenging executive management and

holding them effectively to account;
•

non-executive directors should ensure they have the time and resources and access to the business

they need to fulfil their duties;
•

executive management have a responsibility to ensure the Board can exercise its role and should

exercise their judgement in bringing key issues to the Board’s attention at an early stage; and
•

the principle of good governance, including independence of the Chairman, should also apply to

material subsidiaries. Boards of regulated subsidiaries need to be able to take decisions where required to
meet their own legal and governance responsibilities or in the interests of the safety and soundness of the
subsidiary. But, that does not mean they should operate outside the general governance and objectives of
the group to which they belong. Independence in this context is carefully defined and limited.

As you will all be aware, we have undertaken significant engagement with the boards of banks and building
societies on governance. Through our supervisory work, we are seeing improvement but in our view there is
more to do. Board effectiveness will therefore remain a key priority. To conclude, governance matters a lot,
I can’t understate that. Effective boards are central to the success of firms and the financial sector, and
central to the delivery of our objectives. Thank you.
