Main messages
Covid-19 and the associated social distancing
measures represent a huge economic shock
that has required a significant policy response.
In May we published a scenario and
sensitivities that provide a framework to guide
our policy actions
However the economic outlook evolves, the
Bank will act as necessary to deliver monetary
and financial stability

Monetary policy supporting households and businesses through
economic disruption
Bank Rate cut from 0.75% to 0.1%
£300bn asset purchase programme (£200bn announced in March and further
£100bn announced in June). Purchases to be completed by year end at a pace
consistent with the effective transmission of monetary policy
Term Funding scheme to support pass through of rate cut
(with additional incentives to support lending to SMEs)
Bank/HMT Covid Corporate Financing Facility launched.
£18 billion lent already to companies directly

The financial system came under a great deal of stress in March
that required a swift response from the MPC.

UK financial and credit conditions remain tight relative to Jan,
which in part informed the vote to extend asset purchases in June

Note: The UK Monetary and Financial Conditions Index (MFCI) summarises information from the following series: short-term and long-term interest rates, the sterling ERI, corporate
bond spreads, equity prices, and household and corporate bank lending spreads. The series weights are based on the estimated impact of each variable on UK GDP. The chart shows
changes in the MFCI from the average level over the 15 working days to 22 January 2020. An increase in the MFCI signals tighter financial conditions and a decrease signals looser
conditions. For more information, see the Bank Overground post ‘How can we measure UK financial conditions?’.

Note: CHAPS data is based on a sample of around 100 UK companies payments received from their merchant acquirers on a daily basis. These payments reflect the sales that companies
make through debit and credit card purchases, which are summed to estimate rolling seven-day revenues Social consumption includes corporate revenues from hotels , restaurants, air
travel and cultural events. Delayable consumption includes household goods, clothing, vehicle purchases and recreational goods. Work related includes travel an fuel. Stapes include
housing, food and health. Spending data shown through June 24th.

Note: The experimental Claimant Count consists of claimants of Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) and some Universal Credit (UC) Claimants. The UC
claimants that are included are 1) those that were recorded as not in employment and those claimants of Universal Credit who are required to
search for work, i.e. within the Searching for Work conditionality regime as defined by the Department for Work & Pensions (from April 2015
onwards). There were more than 34 million economically active individuals in the UK estimated in the most recent ONS labour market summary,
covering the 3 month period Feb 2020 to Apr 2020.

CPI Inflation has fallen to 0.5% in May 2020 driven by falling
energy prices

Scenario assumptions
•

Social distancing measures and support measures in UK and rest of the world remain as they are until early June, before being
gradually unwound over Q3

•

Some of the spending foregone while social distancing measures are in place is made up, but lower confidence and higher
uncertainty persist for some time

•

The scenario is sensitive to assumptions around social distancing measures and assumptions surrounding the long term productivity
implications of protracted spells of high unemployment (See May MPR Table 1.B for more details)

But, the outlook and economic policy will depend on the extent of the
temporary and permanent economic adjustment induced by Covid-19
• The speed of the recovery of discretionary household demand and its
composition
• The extent to which furloughed workers will return to their previous jobs
• The permanent changes resulting from social distancing measures
• More working from home and less travel?
• More retail online?

Example: Consequence of working from home
• More performance-based contracts.
Riskier?
More cautious consumers?
• More need to screen workers.
Returns to “soft” skills rise?
Harder for younger workers?
• More need for business process re-engineering.
Returns to well-run businesses rise?
Returns to commercial property fall?

Conclusion
•

•

•
•

Policy has responded to unprecedented
times, I view the current stance as
appropriate, but risks are to the downside
e.g. fear of ill-health (Goolsbee/Syverson)
and unemployment.
Future policy contingent on the longer run
implications of the downturn and
permanent adjustments required of the
economy e.g. work patterns
