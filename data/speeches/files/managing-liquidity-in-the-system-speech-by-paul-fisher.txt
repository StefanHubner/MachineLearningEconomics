“Managing Liquidity in the System:
The Bank’s Liquidity Insurance Operations”

The Loan Market Association Syndicated Loans Conference, London,
30 September 2010.

The Bank of England uses its balance sheet1 to support its core objectives of both monetary and
financial stability. The financial crisis over the past three years has clearly placed more emphasis
on the latter. So, this morning, I want to set out how the Bank has developed its ‘Sterling
Monetary Framework’ in order to support financial stability: in particular what we refer to as the
‘liquidity insurance’ operations. Since the liquidity of the banking system is crucial to the
functioning of financial markets, this should be of direct interest to the LMA’s members. I intend
to briefly describe the main facilities as they now stand, including changes made during the past
three years. I then want to address some topical issues that have arisen.

Central bank money and monetary policy

The balance sheet of a Central Bank plays a crucial role in the implementation of its policy
objectives. In a Quarterly Bulletin article earlier this year, we set out an analysis of how the Bank
of England’s balance sheet evolved during the financial crisis.2 Let me briefly spell out the main
elements. The main entry on the liability side of the balance sheet is ‘central bank money’,
comprising banknotes, which are supplied on demand, and the reserve accounts of commercial
banks and building societies.3 These are effectively sterling current accounts for the commercial
banks – they are among the safest assets a bank can hold and are the ultimate means of payment
between banks. In normal circumstances, the main entry on the asset side of the balance sheet is
the Bank’s lending to those same commercial banks.4 In setting monetary policy, our normal
objective would be to lend exactly the amount of central bank money demanded, consistent with
the MPC’s choice of Bank Rate. Crucially, although the targets for reserves accounts may react
to the state of financial stability in the system, the Bank’s choices here are dictated by the stance
of monetary policy.

In normal times, we ask the banks to choose their own targets for reserve accounts and then lend
just enough cash to the system as a whole so that the banks can collectively meet the aggregate of
their targets. The commercial banks will then lend to, or borrow from each other in the inter-bank
market, to distribute the total amount of cash around the system so that each individual institution
can meet its target. Each bank is incentivised to meet its reserves target by the application of
penalty rates to those who are – on average over a monthly maintenance period – either

excessively short or long. If an institution cannot meet its target through the inter-bank market, it
can use the Bank’s standing deposit and lending facilities. Under these facilities, reserve account
holders can deposit with, or borrow from the Bank overnight for unlimited amounts at a fixed
penalty to Bank Rate. So in practice, these facilities impose a narrow corridor on either side of
the Bank Rate. For example, if it becomes cheaper for a commercial bank to borrow under the
standing facilities than to borrow in the market, then it will do so, providing a natural ceiling to
short-term market interest rates. That in turn ensures that overnight interest rates5 remain close to
Bank Rate set by the MPC.

Exceptionally, to fund the programme of asset purchases in 2009/10, the Bank unilaterally
increased the size of commercial bank reserves on a massive scale – from around £36bn at the
start to a peak of around £164bn. Since that level was far in excess of the commercial banks’ own
targets we suspended the reserves averaging system and agreed to pay Bank Rate on all reserves
held with us. And, in place of lending to the banks, we supplied the extra cash to the system by
the direct purchases of assets. I want to stress that the banks had no choice but to accept that their
collective holdings of reserves would go up. Of course, individual banks could have tried to pass
the money in these accounts on to each other, but unless it was withdrawn in the form of
banknotes, then it would just go round the system and end up, each day, back in an account with
the Bank of England. And by paying Bank Rate on all reserves, we retained close control over
market rates, even though the quantity of central bank money was swollen.

Using the balance sheet to support financial stability

Given that these mechanisms are used to implement monetary policy set by the MPC, then what
else can a central bank do with its balance sheet to support financial stability, independently of
those monetary policy decisions? That’s the question that I want to focus on in the rest of this
talk.

The nature of a commercial bank’s business fundamentally involves maturity transformation.
Customer deposits may be available for instant withdrawal while bank lending to corporate and
households tends to be committed, potentially for many years. As a result, banks typically run
significant liquidity risks. The provision of a central bank reserves account helps commercial
banks to manage their liquidity risk, by allowing them meet their ordinary payments needs,
5

Since lending to the Bank is free from credit risk, it is the secured overnight rate – up to the next MPC decision date
- that should be broadly in line with Bank Rate.

including normal intra-day variations. But at times, even a well-run bank can suffer an
unexpected shortage of liquidity. To mitigate that risk, the central bank provides back-stop
liquidity insurance to both individual institutions and to the system as a whole under stress (as in
the aftermath of Lehman’s collapse, reflecting a system-wide increase in both credit and liquidity
risk). The objective is to reduce the cost of liquidity disruptions for solvent and viable institutions
and so maintain the flow of payments services of the UK financial system. But in meeting that
objective, the Bank must ensure that it guards against moral hazard, by setting the incentives in
such a way that discourages anything but exceptional use of our facilities, and that it adequately
protects its own balance sheet from risk of loss.6

Operational Standing Facilities

The process of reserves averaging should deal with small unexpected liquidity shortages or long
positions. For larger shocks, the most immediate short-term form of liquidity insurance is the
Bank’s Operational Standing Facilities which, as well as helping keep short-term interest rates
close to Bank Rate, can help individual firms cope with frictional stress such as operational
disruptions and short-term volatility in market interest rates. Under these facilities, reserve
account holders can deposit with, or borrow from the Bank overnight for unlimited amounts at a
penalty to Bank Rate.7

Open Market Operations

The Bank’s Open Market Operations (OMOs) take the form of reverse repo operations –
economically equivalent to secured lending – at different maturities. Normally we would lend
(cash) short-term for one week and longer-term for multiples of three months. Short-term repos
have not been needed regularly since we started to inject cash directly via the asset purchase
programme. But normally short-term lending operations would take place weekly at a size
designed to be consistent with the commercial banks’ aggregate reserve targets for that
maintenance period. This short-term lending takes place against a relatively narrow set of high-

6

The intention is to avoid a firm drawing on publicly-provided liquidity support mechanisms if they actually have a
fundamental problem of solvency or viability. But liquidity risk can never be completely distinguished from
solvency risk at a point of stress.

Currently, the deposit rate is zero and the borrowing rate 75bps. In more normal conditions, these spreads can be
expected to be symmetric around Bank Rate.

quality collateral – mainly government bonds. The price has usually been Bank Rate8 and bids
pro-rated.

Short-term repos are not intended to provide any back-stop liquidity support. They are limited,
competitive and take a narrow range of high quality collateral. They are designed to help
implement the monetary policy stance. If there is excess central bank money in the system
relative to reserve targets, the Bank can also drain cash out. We can do this either by repo of
bonds held on the Bank’s balance sheet or by offering to supply one-week Bank of England bills
at Bank Rate.9

Longer-term repos have a monetary objective in part. It is not necessarily efficient to lend very
large amounts of cash every week in short-term repos. It would imply that the market was
consistently short of cash in large size on a week-by-week basis, perhaps putting unnecessary
strain on the inter-bank lending market and on the Bank’s operations. That strain could, perhaps,
cause unwanted volatility in overnight rates. By lending a proportion of the cash for longer term
– three months or more – the Bank can ensure that the size of short-term repo operations are set at
an appropriate level.

Using longer-term repos to meet financial stability objectives has grown in importance during the
financial market crisis. They can provide liquidity support in at least three dimensions: maturity,
size and collateral type. The inter-bank market has been quite disrupted at times during the past
three years. Counterparty credit concerns have limited unsecured lending, and liquidity was
sometimes hoarded. A range of asset managers increased their holdings of cash at increasingly
short maturity – ultimately in overnight accounts – concentrated in what they assessed to be the
safest banks. In consequence, other banks struggled to get the liquidity they needed via market
mechanisms, particularly term borrowing, even when there was more than sufficient cash in the
system as a whole and even if the firms had good quality collateral. The amounts being rolled in
overnight markets became a risk in itself. The Bank responded by massively increasing its
lending at three months maturity from £12bn before the crisis to a peak of around £180bn in early
2009. Essentially we chose to lend so that any bank which needed to could bid for and obtain
liquidity at three months. The significant increase in term liquidity that ensued meant that there
would have been downwards pressure on short-term interest rates. So in order to keep market

The Bank can choose to lend in variable rate repos. This happened for a brief period in mid-2009.
Again, variable rate bills could be used. This happened during the first few months of the asset purchase
programme.

interest rates close to Bank Rate, the Bank drained the excess liquidity via issuing Bank of
England bills. At its peak, the Bank issued around £100bn of one-week bills.

This process of lending on one side of the Bank’s balance sheet and borrowing on the other - both
in large scale - effectively dis-intermediated the malfunctioning sterling inter-bank market,
ensuring that central bank money got to all those counterparties which needed it.

In addition to the greater size and longer maturity of lending, the Bank also widened the pool of
collateral eligible in the three-month lending operations to accept high-quality private sector
securities.10 These included AAA RMBS and covered bonds, neither of which had previously
been taken as collateral by the Bank in OMOs.11 This provided further support to the banking
system, at a time when both primary and secondary markets for these private sector securities had
closed.

The temporary expansion of long-term repos during the crisis raised a number of important policy
questions for the Bank. Firstly, it was very difficult to decide exactly how large the operations
should be. This had to be assessed by reading market conditions. Secondly, the Bank also had to
set an appropriate price to charge for lending against wider collateral, to mitigate adverse
selection and the moral hazard risk. A minimum 50 basis point spread was applied. Thirdly,
since the increase in the Bank’s liabilities (commercial bank reserves) was being funded at Bank
Rate, and the assets were earning rates linked to 3-month market rates, there was a significant
interest-rate mis-match. When Bank Rate was cut rapidly and by more than was anticipated by
the market during Autumn 2008, the Bank recorded a large, unintentional surplus.12 In the
permanent regime, it is important that the Bank not be exposed to the risk of a large loss if Bank
Rate were to be increased above market expectations.

In June 2010, those operations were replaced with a new permanent framework designed in part
to reflect these concerns. The operations, pioneered with the invaluable help of Paul Klemperer
from Nuffield College, Oxford, are known as ‘Indexed Long-Term Repos’. The most innovative
aspect is that banks can bid to borrow cash against either the normal, ‘narrow’ collateral set – as
standard in short-term repos – or a ‘wider’ set of collateral, including private sector securities.
Counterparties can submit bids using one or both types of collateral. They can even make a
10

Initially the collateral list was expanded in the Autumn of 2007 and then again in Autumn 2008.
Our approach to risk managing these securities has been set out in the Quarterly Bulletin. See Breeden and
Whisker (2010), Quarterly Bulletin, 50, 2, pages 94-103.

‘paired bid’, quoting spreads at which they would be indifferent between the two collateral sets.
The Bank of England then allocates a proportion of the operation against wider collateral, where
that proportion depends on the spreads offered. The idea is that as the market becomes more
stressed, counterparties are willing to pay more to borrow against wider collateral. As the
clearing spread rises the Bank, automatically within the auction, lends a greater proportion against
wider collateral. The clearing price is the intersection of the revealed demand schedule of the
firms bidding and the private supply schedule of the Bank of England. After each ILTR
operation, the Bank can use the pattern of bids to help assess whether the total amount on offer
needs to be changed for the next monthly operation. In addition, we decided to index the clearing
spreads to the subsequent out-turn for Bank Rate, with a minimum spread of zero so that there is
no interest-rate risk to the Bank of England.

Finally, the Bank is also able to respond to strains in short-term foreign currency funding markets,
utilising swap lines with other central banks to conduct foreign currency OMOS. For example, in
September 2008, the Bank, in concert with a number of other central banks, announced coordinated measures designed to address continued elevated pressures in US dollar short-term
funding markets

The Special Liquidity Scheme

During early 2008, following the collapse of Bear Stearns, and with the continued closure of the
securitisation markets making mortgage-backed securities and hence mortgages substantially
illiquid, it became clear that additional and exceptional liquidity support would be needed for the
UK banking system. The Special Liquidity Scheme was designed to provide that support on a
one-off basis, in large size and for a long maturity. The form of the Scheme was an asset swap
(effectively a collateral upgrade). For a fee, the commercial banks were lent nine-month Treasury
bills against a broad set of eligible collateral. In practice the collateral received in the Scheme
was dominated by own-name residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS and covered bonds).
The banks could use the Treasury bills to raise liquidity in the market, at a time when the primary,
secondary and repo markets for RMBS were all closed. These bills were also eligible in the
Bank’s repo operations.

The Scheme was limited to lending against collateral that was held on balance sheet at the end of
2007. The principle was that the Bank shouldn’t support the banks in issuing new securities for
7

which there might not be a private market or to subsidise new lending.13 The fact that the Special
Liquidity Scheme was a form of asset swap meant that it had no impact on the supply of central
bank money and thus no direct implications for monetary policy. Following standard accounting
practice, it was not on the Bank’s balance sheet.14

The Scheme will expire at the end of January 2012. It will not be extended or replaced. After
three years of large-scale liquidity support the Bank expects each institution to be in a position to
fund itself through normal market mechanisms. In order to prevent a refinancing ‘cliff’ at the end
of 2011, the Bank has had bilateral discussions with the main users of the Scheme to ensure that
there are credible funding plans in place to reduce their use of it in a smooth fashion. Of the
£185bn of Treasury bills initially advanced, some £57bn has already been repaid.

The Discount Window Facility

Alongside the Operational Standing Facilities to cope with short-term frictional shocks, and
Long-Term Repos to cope with system-wide liquidity shocks, the Bank’s Discount Window
Facility offers large-scale liquidity support for idiosyncratic as well as system-wide shocks. The
Discount Window was launched during the heart of the crisis in October 2008. It allows banks
and building societies to borrow gilts against a wide range of collateral, at fees reflecting the type
of that collateral and the size of the drawing relative to the size of the firm. Although similar in
principle, the Discount Window is not intended to be a direct replacement for the Special
Liquidity Scheme. It is both shorter-term and more expensive in steady-state, in line with the
underlying principles for all the Bank of England’s permanent liquidity insurance operations: that
commercial banks should be incentivised to manage their liquidity risk prudently in the market.
The terms were also designed to protect the Bank against risk to its own balance sheet.

Transactions under the Discount Window facility are intended to be for a maximum 30 days,
although they can be rolled. In recognition of continuing stresses in financial markets, the Bank
announced in January 2009 that, for an additional fee of 25 basis points, it would temporarily
permit drawings from the Discount Window with a maximum term of 364 days.

13

Because covered bonds and master trust RMBS are based on revolving pools of mortgages, an exception was made
to accommodate them, but with a strictly declining limit over the three year life of the Scheme.
14
But it did require Treasury agreement for the Debt Management Office to create and lend the additional Treasury
bills, and for the Treasury to underwrite the Scheme should there be any losses.

8

Access to the Discount Window is only permitted for firms that are considered by the Bank to be
solvent and viable. Nevertheless, large scale borrowing from the central bank can generate credit
risk concerns in the minds of market counterparties. To avoid this ‘stigma’, the Bank releases
information on the use of the Facility averaged over counterparties and over a three-month period,
released with a further quarter’s lag.

Following a market consultation, the Bank has recently announced that, as of early next year, it
will extend the range of collateral it is willing to take in the Discount Window to include diverse
portfolios of ‘raw’ loans. 15 This extension has a number of advantages. Securitising loans into
asset backed securities – such RMBS – is expensive and only available to firms large enough to
have a securitisation programme. Allowing portfolios of loans to be used directly as collateral
means that a smaller firm, without a securitisation platform, can also access the Window. Since
financial instability can start with smaller banks just as easily as larger ones, expanding the
universe of possible Discount Window counterparties has a significant financial stability benefit.
By eliminating the need for securitisation, it also reduces somewhat the costs for all firms in
maintaining a portfolio of collateral pre-positioned at the Bank of England. We encourage
counterparties to lodge collateral with the Bank and to use it to test the system. This ensures that
they are able to draw on the Facility immediately in a time of need so that the system is prepared
for and protected against further bouts of instability.

We were very grateful for the LMA’s thoughtful response to the Bank’s consultation on DWF
collateral and, in particular, for their very positive support of our proposal to take portfolios of
loans. We did not agree on everything that the LMA wanted! We feel it would be inappropriate
to take leveraged loans as collateral for example, given the higher risk associated with them. But
we look forward to working together in the future. Amongst other things, sorting out the
documentation of loan portfolios will be an important priority for both us and for the LMA going
forward.

Related issues

Having described the Bank’s liquidity insurance operations, I want to address a few related issues
which are sometimes raised with me. The first concerns the state of the securitisation markets and
that for covered bonds in particular. In Europe, the ECB routinely takes covered bonds and other
private sector securities as collateral in all of its operations. And there is a perception of state
support for the covered bond market, perhaps because covered bonds have often been issued by
quasi-state banks. The Bank is occasionally lobbied by industry representatives to offer more
support to the covered bond market. I want to make three points in response.

First, that RMBS and covered bonds are already eligible collateral in both the Indexed Long-Term
Repo operations and in the Discount Window Facility alongside a range of other private sector
securities.16 It is only short-term OMOs, which are conducted for monetary policy purposes,
where such assets are not eligible. In order to help manage the risks arising from securitised
assets, and to help improve market functioning by establishing higher standards, the Bank will be
demanding detailed disclosures – to the Bank and publicly – on the underlying assets and
structures. This transparency initiative has generally been welcomed by investors and we hope it
will encourage the establishment of viable securitisation markets in future.

Second, the Bank’s permanent operations are intended to offer liquidity support for the banking
system, not for the market in any one particular type of security. Intervening in a partial way
could create unfortunate market distortions. If there is a genuine market for a private sector
security, it should be able to support itself in the medium-term without special forms of liquidity
support from the authorities.

Third, the asset purchase programme, although focussed on buying gilts, was intended to support
the liquidity of all private sector securities by forcing would-be gilt holders to purchase more
risky assets (rather than by direct central bank purchases of those assets). There is plenty of
evidence to suggest that was indeed the outcome and most private sector markets have recovered
to some degree. The covered bond market has also been supported by the introduction of FSA
regulations, to provide additional comfort for investors.17

16

A bank may not submit its own covered bonds in Long Term Repos, only those of other issuers. But it may submit
either in the DWF.

10

A second topical issue is bank funding more generally. It is often asserted that the Special
Liquidity Scheme provides a funding source for banks and that, given continuing pressures on
them to raise funds to support lending, we should extend the lifetime of the Scheme. The first
point to note is that the Scheme facilitates funding but does not provide it directly. Rather, as I
have outlined today, the SLS provides a collateral upgrade and the private sector remains the
ultimate source of funding as the Treasury Bills lent under the Scheme are turned into cash in the
market. A similar point can be made about debt issued under the Government’s Credit Guarantee
Scheme – the Government provides a guarantee but it is still the market which buys the bonds and
provides the cash. As these schemes come to an end, the challenge for the banks is not so much
the sourcing of an additional quantity of funding. It is to roll over that existing market funding
into different funding instruments.

More generally, a central bank should not allow its liquidity operations to become, or even to be
perceived as a source of sustained funding for banks or for any other form of medium-term
lending. The only medium-term source of commercial bank funding, and hence for their lending,
is private sector savings, whether channelled through retail or wholesale markets. A central bank
does not have access to those private sector savings.

The grey area is that short-term liquidity support, in size and continually rolled over, looks and
acts a lot like funding. That is why the Special Liquidity Scheme was designed to lend against
legacy assets only and one of the reasons why the Bank has been so determined that it will end as
scheduled. Suppose the scheme were to be rolled on indefinitely. What was intended and
designed as system-wide central bank liquidity support would become instead a fiscal operation.
We would be using government debt – and hence public money – to subsidise a group of private
sector firms, with the public purse being at risk. There are serious political choices here, and they
are not for the central bank to make.

I have set out in this talk many of the things that a central bank can do with its balance sheet. It
can create central bank money, and does so in implementing monetary policy. It can also support
financial stability. The Bank can use its operations to distribute money around the banking
system when the inter-bank market is not operating properly. And it can provide emergency
short-term liquidity support for the system or individual banks under operational and market
stress by changing the size, the maturity and the type of collateral taken in its operations. And
can even supply foreign currency in extremis. But, being without access to private sector savings,
11

the Bank can not provide sustained, medium-term funding for banks, nor lend directly in size to
the non-financial sector on a sustained basis.

Credit supply and syndicated loans

Finally, and especially given the nature of this conference, I want to touch on the supply of credit
more generally. Despite various forms of support from the Bank of England and from
Government, it is clear that the lending capacity of the banking system, in the UK and elsewhere,
is impaired and will take some years yet to recover. Some banks need to continue de-risking and
de-leveraging. Others, including new banks, are likely to grow. But the supply of bank lending
to businesses during the recovery is likely to be more expensive than it was pre-crisis and
possibly constrained in quantity. In 2009 we saw one of the consequences, with a record year for
sterling corporate bond and equity issuance as investment grade corporates by-passed the banking
sector.

The loans market is a particularly important part of the system of credit provision. Syndicated
loans allow firms to borrow in larger size and for longer periods, and facilitate the lenders in
diversifying their risk. Given the highly concentrated origination of business lending in this
country, it is useful that the syndicated loans market and the secondary loans market allow a
wider group of firms to contribute to lending to UK businesses, including non-bank participation.

Over the next few years there are a lot of corporate loans, made during the boom years of credit
supply, which fall due for repayment or rollover. That is a particular challenge for subinvestment grade borrowers, including most SMEs. It is clear that the high-yield debt markets are
very much more developed in the United States than in Europe and so a greater burden here falls
on bank finance. But non-banks may also have a key role to play. The Bank has been engaging
with market participants over policies or market developments in the loans market which would
support lending by non-bank institutions. Some of that analysis was reflected in a discussion
paper on non-bank lending, published by HM Treasury earlier this year. Whatever the ultimate
source of finance, we sincerely hope that the UK loans market will be able to play its part in the
necessary provision of credit to viable small and medium-sized businesses which will be, in large
part, the future source of UK economic growth.
