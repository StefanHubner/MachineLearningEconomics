I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak at this year’s Monetary Policy and
the Markets conference. Over the course of this year, extreme market volatility has
posed some very big challenges for the setting of monetary policy in the UK and other
major economies.

First of all, we have seen a giant rollercoaster in energy and many other commodity
markets. The oil price, which started the year at around $90/barrel, rose to nearly
$150 and has since fallen back to just over $40. The surge in energy and commodity
prices has generated a rise in UK consumer price inflation to over 5% – its highest
level for over sixteen years. It is also the sharpest upward movement in this measure
of inflation in the history of this data series, which goes back to the late 1980s. This
rise in inflation has squeezed real incomes, contributing to the slowdown in consumer
spending over the course of this year – though, over the months ahead, we should see
both these effects reverse as recent falls in energy and commodity prices feed through
to consumers and firms.

Second, there has been extreme volatility and stress in financial markets, resulting in
the most serious banking crisis in modern economic history.

The disruption to

financial markets and its knock-on impact on the cost and availability of credit, as
well as on business and consumer confidence, has pushed many economies across the
globe into recession in the second half of this year, including the UK. The financial
crisis has also complicated the operation of monetary policy by creating a large and
uncertain wedge between the rates set by Central Banks and lending rates more
generally across the economy.

It is difficult to imagine a more turbulent market environment against which we have
had to operate monetary policy. As separate developments, a rise in inflation to over
5% and a move into recession would have seemed remote possibilities at the start of
this year.

The fact that both have happened together, accompanied by a major

financial crisis, is an indication of how unusual and unprecedented the events of 2008
have been.

Policy responses

Some dramatic steps have now been taken by policy-makers to stabilise the financial
system and to head off the sharp downturn in demand which has emerged in the wake
of the turmoil on financial and commodity markets. September and October saw
dramatic moves by governments and financial regulators to restore order to the
banking system in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That has included
direct government injections of capital into some major banks in the UK, the US and
in other major economies.1

Monetary policy has also been relaxed dramatically. In the UK, Bank Rate has been
reduced to its lowest level since 1951. The three percentage point reduction in the
official policy rate matches the sharp reduction we saw in the wake of the UK’s exit
from the ERM in the autumn of 1992.2 In the last hundred years, there are only two
occasions when interest rates have fallen more sharply in a three-month period – in
1914 and in 1977. And in both of these episodes, the fall in interest rates was
reversing a sharp rise in the months before the cut – which is not the case at present.
Interest rates also started to be cut at an earlier stage of this downturn than was the
case in previous UK recessions.

The stimulus to demand provided by this relaxation in monetary policy will be
supported by the fiscal measures announced last month in the Pre-Budget Report.
Fiscal and monetary responses in other countries affected by the current downturn
should also help to support export demand as we move through next year.

But it will take time for these policy measures to take effect. At the same time, the
consequences of the recent financial market turbulence are also still feeding through.
Following the contraction in GDP in the third quarter of this year, the latest business
survey evidence suggests that the downturn intensified in the fourth quarter. This
downturn is most noticeable in surveys of manufacturers – such as the CBI Monthly

This is consistent with an acceleration in the downturn driven by weak global demand
and reinforced by a stock cycle in which lower demand from final consumers ripples
down the supply chain. Both weak global demand and a rundown in stock levels
throughout the supply chain are likely to affect manufacturing industry more than
other sectors – and the survey evidence is consistent with this view. This stock cycle
and the knock-on consequences of weak global demand may have further to run –
particularly for durable purchases such as motor cars. Further reductions in output are
therefore likely in the first half of next year.

Even if we do see a recovery beginning in the second half of 2009 – as suggested by
the Bank’s November Inflation Report forecast – this recession is likely to be
comparable in length and depth with the previous three major post-war UK downturns
in the mid-70s, early-80s and early-90s.3 In each of these earlier episodes, the output

3

The November Inflation Report forecast was for a recession that is slightly less deep than in the three
major post-war UK downturns. However, recent survey data have been weaker than that forecast
implied and so I now expect the recession to be of comparable depth to those previous downturns.

of the economy fell by at least 2.5% over a period of a year or more, resulting in a
significant rise in unemployment.4

However, unlike those previous recessions, this one is being driven significantly by
developments in financial markets, rather than the inflationary boom-bust cycles we
have seen in the past. In my speech today, I want to discuss what difference this
might make to the kind of downturn we can expect and the way in which policy
responds to it.

Post-war recessionary cycles

Prior to the current recession, the major downturns we had previously seen in the UK
generally had the characteristics of an inflationary “boom-bust cycle”.

A period of

rapidly expanding demand puts strain on the supply potential of the economy,
resulting in a pick-up in inflation. The impact of high inflation and the policies
needed to contain it sow the seeds of the downturn which then follows.

Output declined by 3.3%, 4.6% and 2.5% from the peak level of activity in the periods 1973-75,
1979-81 and 1990-92. Claimant count unemployment rose by 540,000 in the three years from the peak
of the 1973-75 cycle, and by 1.40 million and 1.34 million respectively in the equivalent three years in
the following two recession. See also Sentance (2008b).

Chart 2 shows that the mid-1970s and early-1990s recessions clearly followed periods
of very strong GDP growth. The 1974-75 recession followed the Barber Boom,
which saw the single strongest calendar year of postwar economic growth – when the
output of the economy rose by over 7% in 1973. The intensity of the boom was such
that even though GDP then fell back in the next two calendar years, GDP in 1975 was
still over 5% up on three years ago.

The Lawson boom in the late 1980s saw a more sustained boom – even if we did not
see such a strong single year of rapid growth as in 1973. Growth averaged around 4%
per annum in the five years to 1988, the peak growth year, and this represented the
strongest five-year period of growth since the Second World War.

The early 1980s recession was not immediately preceded by such a strong surge in
GDP growth. However, there was still a sharp pick-up in the growth of money
spending and of inflation, as Chart 3 shows. Indeed, double digit growth in nominal
spending and a sustained pick-up in inflation – followed by a squeeze on both demand
and inflation – is a key common ingredient in all these previous recessionary cycles in
the UK.

6

7
However, Chart 3 also shows that this pattern has not been repeated in the run-up to
the current recession. Though inflation has picked up over the course of this year, this
was due to a surge in global energy and commodity prices – and has not been driven
by demand factors in the UK. Nominal domestic demand has been slowing recently,
and other indicators of domestic inflationary pressure – such as wage growth – have
also been subdued. GDP growth in the five years prior to this year’s downturn (20032007) averaged 2.7% per annum – just 0.1% above the postwar average growth rate.

In one sense this is not surprising. The inflation target framework established in the
1990s, within which the Monetary Policy Committee operates, was designed precisely
to avoid the inflationary boom-bust cycles that we have seen before in the UK. The
MPC has been sensitive to signs of a pick-up in domestic inflationary pressures –
raising interest rates in the late 1990s, 2003/4 and 2006/7 to head off this risk. The
resulting record of low and stable inflation has helped to anchor expectations when
inflationary threats have emerged – as they did with the sharp surge in energy and
commodity prices this year.

A bust without a boom?
Viewed through the lens of the classic inflationary boom-bust cycle, therefore, we
appear to be experiencing a bust without having experienced a preceding boom, at
least in terms of short-term measures of the growth of UK demand and domestic
inflationary pressures.

But there have been some aspects of the recent period of

economic expansion which are more characteristic of a boom-bust cycle, though
perhaps in a different form to those we have seen in the past.

First, as Chart 4 shows, the last five years have seen a very strong period of world
economic growth, contributing significantly to the upward pressure on global energy
and commodity prices, as we also saw in the periods leading up to the recessions of
the 1970s and 1980s. The upward pressure on energy and commodity prices reflects
the fact that this growth has been particularly strong in resource-hungry emerging
market economies.

As Chart 5 shows, trend growth in the “advanced economies” – including the US,
Europe and Japan – has gradually slowed since the 1970s.

But the growth

performance of the emerging market and developing country economies in the last
decade is the strongest we have seen in the last forty years. This is not just a “China
effect”. It reflects the fact that all the major regions of the emerging/developing
world – Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and the former Soviet
economies – have performed strongly over the course of this decade.5

Second, we have seen across many countries strong sustained upward pressure on
housing and property prices more generally, as Chart 6 shows. The origins of this
global housing and property boom are controversial. Some economists have argued
that this reflects a “search for yield” in safe assets which is a bi-product of the “global
savings glut” and historically low long-term real interest rates. An alternative view
could be that in a world in which product, labour and capital markets are increasingly
globalised, inflationary pressures are more likely to show up in the most scarce
commodity of all – land and property.

Rapid house price growth has not been confined to the US and UK. As Chart 6
shows, the last five years have seen stronger house price inflation in Spain and France
than in Anglo-Saxon economies. However, the fact that this appears to be a global
phenomenon – and house price growth has picked up in the last five years in many
countries – is consistent with the view that world demand has been particularly strong
in the recent economic upswing.

The third worrying boom-bust indicator has been the external account.

In past

economic cycles, a deterioration in the trade balance and the current account of the
balance of payments has been a signal of excess demand growth, most noticeably in
the late 1980s when a rapid balance of payments deterioration was a signal of
suppressed inflation which became more apparent in the early 1990s.

Could something similar have been happening in the 2000s? In the expansion of the
UK economy in this decade, we have seen deterioration in the trade balance – as
Chart 7 shows. Although not as dramatic as we saw in the late 1980s, this could still
indicate that, at the prevailing strong exchange rate, the inflationary consequences of
strong demand growth were damped down because the real incomes of wage-earners
were boosted by low import prices resulting from the combination of the “China
effect” and a strong pound. This effect could be reversed at a lower exchange rate or
in the wake of recent cost shocks, though at the expense of higher inflation.
10

11

In the 1990s, Steve Nickell estimated that each 1% of GDP deterioration in the goods
and services trade balance represents one percentage point of suppressed inflation.6
According to Nickell’s model, a high real exchange rate would also be reflected in a
better inflation/unemployment trade-off in the short-term. So it would reduce the
equilibrium unemployment rate for a while, but then unemployment would need to be
higher when the exchange rate depreciates and workers feel a squeeze on their real
wages.

It is not clear how significant this effect might have been in the early 2000s.
However, this interpretation of recent unemployment experience would suggest
caution about some of the supply-side optimism we have seen in recent years. To the
extent that the reduction in unemployment reflected suppressed inflation and a high
exchange rate, this may not be sustained into the future. The conclusion that would
flow from this is that some part of the reduction in unemployment we have identified
as structural may not be sustainable at a lower exchange rate, and that we have overestimated the underlying supply potential of the economy as a result.

Financial liberalisation, globalisation and price stability

So, while we may not have seen a classic inflationary boom-bust cycle on the 1970s1990s model, it would equally be wrong to deny that the current bust was preceded by
a boom of some sort. We have indeed had a long expansion of economic activity in
the UK – indeed, as Chart 8 shows – it is the second longest uninterrupted expansion
since the mid-19th century!

This has been against the background of strong global growth of demand, particularly
in recent years, and has also been associated with strong inflationary pressures in
energy and commodity markets, as well as a sharp escalation of property prices.

The final point I would make is that if we take a longer view of economic history,
stretching back to the Industrial Revolution, financial and commodity booms and
busts were the predominant drivers of economic cycles. The characteristics of the
current cycle have much more in common with cycles experienced before the First
World War and even pre-industrial economic history than they do with post-war
inflationary cycles.

We are now appreciating that the earlier years of this decade saw an expansion of
various forms of financial market activity which have subsequently proved
unsustainable. The rapid correction we are now seeing is spilling over into the real
economy – creating recessionary forces. This is not the unwinding of a classic
inflationary boom-bust cycle that we have seen before in postwar Britain. But it is
nevertheless creating equally severe consequences as it unwinds.

12

13
So why did this financial boom or bubble emerge? Various explanations have been
given by economic commentators and indeed by other MPC members.7 To me, this
latest boom-bust cycle seems to me to be the product of three structural trends which
have come together to produce an unintended consequence – global financial and
economic instability. It is a product of three developments which are totally rational
in their own right – financial liberalisation; globalisation; and price stability. Each
brings great benefits.

Financial liberalisation brings access to new innovative

financial products, and a lessening of the dead hand of regulation. Globalisation
opens up access to new markets and products across the globe. And price stability has
appeared to offer a reduction in macroeconomic risks, as it has been associated –
since the early 1990s – with much less volatility in the real economy, as Chart 9
shows.

It was in the 19th and very early 20th century when we last saw this combination of
open financial markets, free trade and an underpinning of price stability provided by
the gold standard. In these earlier times, financial and commodity markets were the
key drivers of economic cycles. As we move into a world with a greater underpinning
of price stability, accompanied by more open trade and financial flows, we need to
7

14
recognise the dangers of a return to the boom-bust cycle of the 19th century, replacing
the boom-bust inflationary cycles of the late 20th century.

Policy conclusions

So what does his imply for monetary policy? In the short-term, the monetary policy
challenge is clear. To act to counter the negative impact on demand from global
slowdown and banking crisis, and to head off the potential deflationary risks created
by an emerging large margin of spare capacity.

The fact that the monetary

transmission mechanism may be affected because of the disruption to the banking
system doesn’t mean that monetary policy is irrelevant as some have begun to argue;
rather it gives added force to the argument for a significant relaxation of policy in the
short-term, which the MPC has delivered.

The current monetary policy framework is giving us a clear steer in this direction, as
Chart 10 shows. The November Inflation Report showed that there was a significant
risk of inflation remaining below target over the medium term. That underpinned the
significant relaxation of policy in the last three months.

14

15

However, it is also important to draw out the longer term lessons from the recent
episode. The first general point is that we need to understand better the two-way
interactions between the financial system and the macroeconomy which have become
clear as this crisis has unfolded. I think it is quite plausible that in a world where
inflation is generally low and stable, financial cycles may once again re-emerge as the
main cause of macroeconomic volatility, just as they did in the earlier period of price
stability underpinned by the gold standard.

In analysing and understanding these

cycles, we will probably need to pay more attention to measures of money and credit
and the channels through which they affect the real economy and inflation, and
incorporate these effects more explicitly in our models.
The second point is that we need to develop better policy instruments for maintaining
the stability of the financial system, and avoiding the financial booms which
inevitably precede the bust. I don’t think it is reasonable to expect monetary policy to
do this unaided – simply by “leaning against the wind” of an asset bubble. This
would create confusion about the objectives of monetary policy and would be very
difficult to operate in practice.

However, there is also a danger of unintended

consequences from heavy-handed regulatory interventions in the banking sector. So
we need to take time to decide what a new regime for regulating the financial sector
looks like, though it is a key economic policy issue in the wake of the current crisis.
Both Sir John Gieve and Charlie Bean have made useful suggestions in recent
speeches on how this might be done.8

Third, a common theme of the two explanations I have given for a “bust without a
boom” is that the period we have classified as the “Great Stability”, stretching back to
the early 1990s, may still have featured an element of growth in demand in excess of
longer term potential – either because a financial bubble was inflating or because
globalisation was masking the domestic inflationary consequences. Unlike previous
booms, this was a much more slow-burning “boom” – which showed itself in property
price inflation and financial imbalances rather than through more traditional measures
of inflation.

Together with the possibility that supply-side potential could be

adversely affected by the financial crisis itself, I do think this should make us more
8

See Bean (2008) and Gieve (2008).

15

16
cautious about the growth of supply potential going forward. I made the case for this
in my first speech as a member of the MPC in January 20079, and this is an issue that
both monetary and fiscal policy-makers will need to return to in judging the
appropriate settings for policy once we are through the immediate crisis.
