President, My Lord Mayor – locum tenens, Excellencies, My Lords, Aldermen,
Sheriff, Ladies and Gentlemen
I’m sure you’ve noticed that time passes more quickly as you get older. I explain it
with my own pet theory of relativity based on the fact that each year that passes is a
smaller proportion of what’s gone before. But I must confess I’m beginning to have
my doubts. It seems much more than 12 months ago that we last came together for
this great annual gathering.
The fact is, it’s been a very long, hard, year, not just for policy-makers around the
world but also for many of you in the financial services industry – particularly the
international financial services industry. We’ve had to cope with the synchronised
global economic slowdown; the extension of the fall in equity prices – with dotcoms
spreading to telecoms and beyond - even now to Enron; with increasing credit risks;
and then with the vicious terrorist attacks of 11th September and their aftermath, and,
finally around the turn of the year with the very sad climax to Argentina’s long drawn
out crisis. I could easily go on. It really has been a long, hard, year.
But there have been shafts of light amidst the general gloom – and I prefer to focus on
those this evening.
In terms of the global economy there are now tentative signs that the worst may soon
be over, with the prospect of gradual recovery as we move through this year. That
should provide some support for global equity markets. With inflationary pressures
subdued, monetary policy generally can, for the time being at least, afford to remain
reasonably supportive – though I make no predictions as to what that may mean for
interest rates. And crucially, for all of us, the international financial system has so far
- and I recognise that problems are often slow to surface but it has so far - stood up
well to the successive shocks.
Much more broadly, I am encouraged that – as with the Asia crisis a few years ago –
the recent pressures have not generally called into question the real benefits of the
market economy, in terms of growth, and employment, and rising living standards,
but have rather contributed to a growing recognition that those benefits can by-pass
poor countries, and poor communities within countries, and that it is in our collective
interest that those who are excluded, one way or another, should be helped to help
themselves to participate in those benefits.
In the context of globalisation, that was reflected in the Doha agreement on a new
round of world trade negotiations; and development financing will be the theme of the
Monterrey Summit next month.
But there has been increasing recognition, too, that the private sector has its role to
play, alongside governments, and it was to encourage and promote the engagement of
private sector firms with disadvantaged, excluded, sectors of our society, through
charitable and community involvement, that the Heart of the City campaign was
launched, very successfully under Andrew Buxton’s leadership, last year.

I’m encouraged, too, by the evidence of clear community of interest between the
financial authorities and the private sector in its commercial activity. Their
co-operation enabled the system to cope remarkably well with the potential
dislocation following the 11th September attacks – and I congratulate the
Federal Reserve in particular and all of you who played a part in that achievement.
The same co-operation is contributing now to the international financial war against
terrorism, and to the strengthening of our disaster contingency plans. It contributed,
too, to the flawless introduction of Euro notes and coin into the Eurozone – so well
managed by the ECB and in which many of you, again, played your part. Another
example is the intensive consultation and co-operation on the development of the
Basel 2 regime for banking supervision.
I’m encouraged finally by the continuing sense of community among financial
professionals here in London. This was movingly evident in their spontaneous
demonstration of solidarity with their counterparts in New York following
11th September. But it was evident too in the formation earlier last year of the Guild
of International Bankers, our co-hosts this evening, and of which you, Lord Mayor –
locum tenens, are the Founding Master. It takes on the mantle – or, perhaps more
appropriately, takes over the ledger – from the Bankers Club which has contributed so
much to the City’s professional esprit de corps over so many years.
So it has, as I said, been a long, hard year, President, but it has certainly had its
positive moments.
And I should like to conclude by paying tribute this evening to the role of the
City Corporation and of the Mayoralty, and their contribution to many of the positive
developments we have seen – through their own example in promoting community
involvement, including their support for the Heart of the City campaign; through their
own role in maintaining security and co-ordinating the “public” infrastructure – both
vital to all our contingency plans; and through their support for the fundamentally
international character of the City, not least in opening the way to the Guild. I am
profoundly grateful to them for all the help and support they give to us all.
It is in that context that I ask you now to rise and join me in a toast to “the Rt Hon The
Lord Mayor, the Corporation of the City of London and the Sheriffs.”
