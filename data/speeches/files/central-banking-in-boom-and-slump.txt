Good evening! It is a great privilege to be asked to give this year’s JSG Wilson Lecture. Professor Wilson
wrote extensively on many topics central to recent events, most notably money markets, monetary policy and
banking. Given these interests, it is perhaps unsurprising that the Bank of England often fell under his
gaze. Indeed, in his review of monetary policy in the 1960s, he was moved to remark that ‘the most notable
contribution [the Bank of England] has made to the emergence of a new climate is in the matter of publicity
and relatively frank speaking’ (Wilson, 1966). I hope that I will live up to that pitch this evening, although I
aim to demonstrate that our recent contributions have been somewhat more substantive than mere words!

Last Thursday, we heard that the UK economy grew 1% in the third quarter. Yes, it was boosted by one-off
factors relating to the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics. But, even after taking those into account, the
figure was stronger than expected. That was welcome news, for the past five years have not been easy.
Following the bursting of the financial bubble, policymakers in the advanced economies have faced
unprecedented challenges. Central banks have needed to find new ways to support a financial system
under great stress and to buttress economic activity. Moreover, the crisis also revealed a major hole in our
framework for managing the economic and credit cycles. So tonight I want to discuss some of the actions
we have taken in dealing with the crisis and subsequent recession, as well as explaining some of the
attendant reforms to the policy framework.

Let me begin by rewinding the clock five years to August 2007 when financial markets first seized up.
UK GDP had grown continuously and at a steady pace for the preceding 64 quarters. And consumer price
inflation had been within a percentage point of the Government's inflation target for every month bar one
since the Bank was given operational responsibility for monetary policy in 1997. Such stability was
historically unprecedented. But the United Kingdom was not unique: other advanced economies also
experienced a long period of unusually benign macroeconomic outcomes.

The period of unusual stability led households, businesses and especially financial institutions to
underestimate the risks they were exposed to. Together with historically low interest rates, at both the short
and long end of the yield curve, that encouraged a debt-fuelled 'search for yield'. The associated expansion
in credit is shown for this country in Chart 1. Note that the debt of financial sector companies is plotted on a
different scale to that for households and real-economy businesses; the remarkable feature of this period is
not the expansion in household or business credit, but the huge increase in the indebtedness of financial
companies. A similar picture obtains for many other advanced economies, including the United States. This
expansion in credit put upward pressure on a range of asset prices, including property.

But macroeconomic factors were not solely responsible for the crisis. Several failings at the microeconomic
level were also relevant, including: inadequate risk management by financial institutions; the use of

off-balance sheet vehicles to evade regulatory capital requirements; weak standards in loan origination,
especially in the US sub-prime market; pay packages that encouraged high-risk trading strategies; and
informational deficiencies stemming from the underlying complexity of new financial instruments
(Bean, 2010). Above all, the huge rise in financial sector debt I noted a moment ago was associated with a
much greater and more complex web of exposures between different financial entities, increasing the risk
that a failure in one part of the financial sector would have systemic consequences. Together these factors
help explain the extreme severity and geographic reach of the crisis.

In the years preceding the crisis, there was some debate in central banking circles as to whether monetary
policy should do more to work against a credit/asset price boom, even though there might be few signs of
overheating in the real economy. On one side, economists at the Bank for International Settlements
(e.g. White, 2006), argued that monetary policy was too loose and should instead ‘lean against the wind’ of a
credit/asset-price boom in order to reduce risks further down the road. On the other side, people such as the
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan (2002), doubted the feasibility of such an approach and
advocated a policy of benign neglect during the boom phase, along with aggressive relaxation should there
be a collapse of asset prices.

As I noted some years ago (Bean, 2003), such ‘leaning against the wind’ is in principle compatible with
flexible inflation targeting: a central bank ought to be willing to undershoot its inflation target temporarily, if it
believes that it will thereby improve its chances of meeting the target later on by avoiding a disruptive bust.
The crisis and subsequent Great Recession seem to make this logic even more compelling. But
unfortunately, by the time an unsustainable credit boom has been diagnosed, a small increase in policy rates
is unlikely to do much to cool it. And a large increase is likely to generate unacceptable collateral damage to
the real economy.
In a paper for the Federal Reserve's annual conference at Jackson Hole a couple of years ago (Bean et al.,
2011), I reported the results of some simulations of what might have happened if Bank Rate had been
200 basis points higher during the four years before the crisis began. The answer is that while the rise in real
house prices over that period would have been less than half as large, the impact on overall real credit
growth would have been pretty modest, reducing it by only a tenth – hardly enough to have a major bearing
on the magnitude of the subsequent bust. Moreover, output would have been some 3 per cent lower.
Monetary policy on its own therefore does not seem especially well suited to preventing credit/asset-price
booms.
So the crisis exposed not only the inadequacy of our understanding of the true nature of the risks that had
built up in the financial sector, but also the need for suitable instruments to deal with them. One of the key
reforms in the United Kingdom following the crisis has been to establish a body – the Financial Policy
Committee (FPC) – with the responsibility for overseeing the stability of the financial system, together with

3

specific powers to achieve that. The FPC will exist on a statutory basis once the Financial Services Act has
passed into law, but has been operating on an interim basis since June 2011.

The FPC has two objectives. First and foremost, it is charged with identifying, monitoring and taking action
to remove or reduce systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial
system. But that is accompanied by a secondary goal: subject to protecting resilience, it should support the
economic policy of the government, including its objectives for growth and employment. This formulation
mirrors that for the Monetary Policy Committee and should ensure that the FPC approaches its primary
objective of ensuring resilience of the financial system in a way that does not unduly impede economic
growth.

Seven of the members of the Committee, including myself, are drawn from within the financial authorities: the
Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority (FSA)1. The remaining four are external members who
bring special expertise and experience and can reduce the risk of the 'group think' that might arise in a
committee comprised solely of insiders. There is also a non-voting representative from the Treasury.

The powers of the Committee are two-fold. First, the FPC can issue recommendations. These could be
general recommendations, for instance to financial institutions or the Treasury. Or they could be specific
requests to the prudential or conduct regulators who would then be expected to comply with the
recommendation or else explain why not. Such recommendations might be called for if there are structural
developments – for instance, new financial instruments – taking place in the financial system that appear to
increase the risk of financial instability.

Second, once the Act has come into force, the FPC will be able to direct the prudential regulator to
implement changes to a small set of instruments in order to achieve its objectives. On the basis of advice
from the FPC, the Treasury is presently consulting on those instruments (HM Treasury, 2012). As it stands,
the current proposals include three tools.

First, there is a countercyclical capital buffer. Under the Basel III capital framework, banks will be required to
hold a higher level of bank capital relative to their risk-weighted assets. But national regulators will be able to
require an additional time-varying buffer that can be increased during the upswing of the credit cycle and
released during the downswing. Under Basel III, the countercyclical capital buffer will be phased in from the
beginning of 2016, becoming fully effective only at the start of 2019. But the Government has said that it
plans to use whatever flexibility is available to give the FPC power over the buffer as soon as is practicable.

1

At present they are: the Governor; the two Deputy Governors; the executive directors for Financial Stability and for Markets; and the
Chairman and Chief Executive of the FSA. When the FSA is dissolved into the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which will be part
of the Bank, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), these last two will be replaced by the heads of the PRA (who will be a third
Deputy Governor of the Bank) and FCA.

There are two ways that such an additional capital buffer mitigates systemic risks. First, it provides a larger
cushion against potential losses, so providing greater resilience in the face of a bust. Second, the imposition
of such an additional capital requirement may also inhibit the expansion of banks' balance sheets, so
dampening the upswing of the credit cycle. This second mechanism obviously requires the Modigliani-Miller
theorem to fail, in the short run at least; if it doesn't then there is no reason for a bank's management to
prefer debt finance to equity finance. Now the most obvious reason why the Modigliani-Miller theorem fails
for banks is the implicit subsidy to debt finance that comes from being 'too big (or too complex) to fail' so that
taxpayers, rather than creditors, pick up the tab if capital is insufficient to absorb losses. Recent and
prospective regulatory reforms seek to reduce the too big/too complex to fail problem, but eliminating it
entirely may be an aspiration too far. Moreover, there are likely to be other frictions to raising capital which
mean that raising capital requirements will inhibit balance sheet growth, providing traction for the
countercyclical capital buffer. However, this is an area where empirical evidence is in relatively short supply
(though for some examples, see: Macroeconomic Assessment Group, 2010; and Aiyar et al., 2012).

The second tool is the ability to vary capital requirements by type of asset, allowing the FPC to target
excessive exuberance in specific sectors. The EU will permit national authorities such discretion in regard to
residential property, commercial property and intra-financial sector exposures. While this list is clearly not
exhaustive, it does include some of the main sectors that have historically been most subject to
over-exuberant credit growth.

The final tool is the ability to set and vary a minimum leverage ratio. A leverage ratio is essentially just (a
transformation of) the ratio of capital to unweighted assets. Such a measure fails to allow for the varying
riskiness of different forms of lending. However, the wide variation in risk weights across banks raises
questions about the reliability of those risk-weight models. Moreover, as my colleague Andy Haldane
(Haldane and Madouros, 2012) recently documented, a simple leverage ratio measure does a somewhat
better job of predicting which banks were more likely to get into difficulties during the crisis than does a
risk-weighted capital ratio2 (see Chart 2). Given the imperfections of risk-weighting, the ability to impose a
minimum leverage ratio provides a useful additional instrument that can backstop the usual risk-weighted
capital ratio. International discussions about the implementation of a leverage ratio are still continuing and
this instrument is only likely to become part of the FPC's toolkit after 2018.

The application of these so-called macroprudential policies is still very much at the developmental stage.
When the Bank gained operational responsibility for monetary policy in 1997, there was a long history of
practical experience, together with a vast theoretical and empirical literature for us to draw on. That didn't
make setting monetary policy easy, but it certainly helped. By comparison, we are still in the Stone Age in
respect of deploying macroprudential policies. There is lots of scope for academia to help us out here, on
both the theoretical and empirical fronts.
2

This uses Basel I risk weights, though it seems unlikely that measures of risk-weighted assets calculated under the Basel II or III rules
would have performed that much better.

Even so – indeed, in large part because of that state of relative ignorance – I think one can lay out some key
principles that should govern the deployment of the FPC’s tools. It will be very easy for the future FPC,
particularly during long periods of tranquillity, to slip into the temptation of neurotically twiddling the dials on
its instruments or issuing recommendations left, right and centre. But what will determine the worth of the
FPC will be whether it is successful in heading off the really big risks – in other words, avoiding a repeat of
the sort of crisis we have just experienced. Ensuring resilience, rather than fine-tuning the credit cycle, must
be the name of the game.

Second, when the FPC does find it necessary to act, it will need to show resolution in taking the punchbowl
away as the party is just getting going. With recent events so fresh in everyone's memories, this may not
seem much of an issue now. But in a decade or two's time, when recent events have receded into history,
such actions will be less welcome. No doubt there will be plenty of people willing then to claim that 'this time
is different' and that the FPC's actions are unnecessarily inhibiting growth. Moreover, if the FPC’s actions
are successful in avoiding a subsequent financial crisis, critics may claim this as evidence that action was
unnecessary in the first place. A central role for the FPC will therefore be to institutionalise the memory of
this and other financial crises.

Finally, the FPC’s instruments may sometimes prove relatively ineffective. That is more likely to happen
when the problems lie beyond the regulatory boundary in the shadow banking sector. At such times,
monetary policy may need to act in a supportive manner, leaning against the wind even though that may
mean accepting a temporary deviation of inflation from target. Achieving this will require appropriate
co-ordination between the two Committees. That should be facilitated by their considerable overlap in
membership.

So far I have focussed on how the Bank will be able to dampen a future boom and strengthen resilience in
the face of excessive exuberance in financial markets. Let me now turn to what may seem a more timely
issue, namely what the central bank can do during and after a financial crisis of the sort we are living
through. In the first instance, of course, the focus has to be on crisis management. That has included:
acting as lender of last resort to illiquid but solvent financial institutions; providing liquidity support through
the market; and acting as a market maker of last resort when a market becomes dysfunctional. During the
crisis we and other central banks have been forced to undertake a much wider range of actions than we
would normally contemplate, lending against a broader range of collateral and for longer tenors than usual,
and intervening in markets where we do not usually operate. While many of the new facilities were invented
on the hoof as the crisis unfolded and should become redundant once normality returns, they will
nevertheless remain in the emergency toolkit in case of future need.

But once the immediate crisis has past, how can central banks foster the recovery? There is now ample
evidence (IMF, 2009; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009) suggesting recoveries after recessions associated with
6

financial crises are typically much more drawn out than those after ‘normal’ recessions. For instance, a
study by the IMF of 122 post-war recessions across 21 countries finds that, on average, output surpasses its
pre-crisis peak around a year after the start of a ‘normal’ recession. But that average period rises to
2½ years following financial crises. And the mean level of output across the 15 recessions associated with
financial crises is still some 6% below a continuation of the pre-crisis trend some seven years after the onset
of the crisis (though there is considerable heterogeneity in individual country experience, as Chart 3 shows).

Why are downturns after financial crises more likely to result in a prolonged period of weak activity and
elevated unemployment – a slump, in other words? There are, I believe, two main reasons. The first is the
unduly sharp and sustained decline in confidence. Over-confidence and underestimation of risks during the
pre-crisis boom gives way to extreme caution and a preference for safe, rather than risky, assets – a shock
to 'animal spirits', if you like. When investment is costly to reverse, that is likely to result in a sharp reduction
in capital expenditure (e.g. Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). Similar arguments apply to durable expenditures by
consumers. The near-seizure of the international financial system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
administered a particularly large adverse shock to animal spirits.

Although that event is gradually receding into the past, it has been superseded by uncertainty surrounding
the ability of the euro area to resolve the indebtedness and competitiveness problems of the periphery.
Substantial policy steps have been taken since the summer, including the launch of the European Stability
Mechanism, steps to set up a banking union, and the ECB's announcement of its willingness to purchase the
short-dated debt of troubled sovereigns. But it will be a long time before a resolution is complete and the
consequent uncertainty is likely to weigh on demand for some time yet.

The second reason why recovery is likely to be slow after a banking crisis, highlighted by those such as
Richard Koo (2003), is that the excess debt and investments built up in the preceding period of
over-optimism need to be worked off. And that process of balance sheet repair – by households, businesses
and financial institutions – typically takes time and involves a period of subdued demand unless the spending
of other, less indebted, agents rises to compensate.

Unlike some other countries which saw substantial rises in house prices during the years preceding the
crisis, the United Kingdom did not see a major boom in residential construction (Broadbent, 2012). As a
result, the overhang of unsold properties needing to be worked off was much smaller here than in, say, the
United States or Spain. Even so, households that had taken out relatively large mortgages might have been
more inclined to cut back their spending when conditions deteriorated in 2008-9 as the financial crisis
worsened. Some support for this hypothesis is provided in Chart 4, which exploits microeconomic data from
the Living Costs and Food Survey to examine consumption patterns by income quartile, split by the
indebtedness of households. It is striking that the sharpest falls in consumption were seen amongst high
income, highly indebted households, though there may be other explanations for this too.

The most important process of balance sheet repair is, though, taking place within the financial sector itself.
As we saw in Chart 1, the pre-crisis period saw a considerable increase in leverage in the financial sector,
leaving banks and similar institutions highly exposed when optimism evaporated. Bank funding costs and
credit default swap spreads then rose substantially, symptomatic of investors’ doubts as to whether they
would get their money back (Chart 5). Funding costs have recently fallen back in the wake of policy
initiatives, such as our Funding for Lending Scheme, though doubts still linger. So, quite independently of
any tightening of regulatory requirements, there has been market pressure on banks to make balance sheets
safer. That, in turn, has encouraged them to direct their supply of loans to just the more credit worthy
borrowers. Moreover, elevated funding costs have also put upward pressure on the loan rates charged to
borrowers, offsetting the impact of lower policy rates.

The drag from these factors – heightened uncertainty and de-leveraging – has been augmented by two
further factors. First, higher prices for oil and other commodities, on the back of firm growth in the emerging
economies and adverse supply developments, implied a deterioration in our terms of trade, imparting a
further drag to the growth in real incomes. Second, as MPC members noted frequently in the years before
the crisis, the composition of UK demand needed to re-balance away from domestic demand towards net
exports in order to shift the current account into balance. On top of that, the financial crisis has most likely
resulted in some deterioration of the capacity of the financial sector to generate export earnings, creating a
need for an additional expansion in the rest of the tradable sector of the economy. Generating this shift in
the composition of activity requires a real depreciation of sterling. While that has happened – the real
effective exchange rate for sterling is almost 15% below its pre-crisis level – it will inevitably take time for
resources to transfer to the tradable sector from the domestically-facing sector. Moreover, weak growth in
most of the other advanced economies has not provided the best of backgrounds for such a re-balancing.

The bottom line of all this is that considerable real adjustments are called for. These real adjustments –
balance sheet repair and the sectoral reallocation of resources – inevitably take time. It is against this
background that monetary policy needs to be set. On the one hand, a highly stimulatory policy stance can
encourage households and businesses to bring forward expenditure, boosting demand and mitigating the
destruction of the economy's supply capacity that can result from a prolonged period of weak demand as
firms are driven out of business and the skills of unemployed workers atrophy. On the other hand, such
policy can also delay the transition to a new growth path if it slows the process of balance sheet repair and
inhibits the process of 'creative destruction' as unprofitable firms are closed and the liberated resources
shifted to the expanding sectors.

Monetary policy has, of course, been highly stimulatory here and in other advanced economies since the
financial crisis. Not only are policy rates close to their zero lower bound, but the Bank of England,
US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan have all engaged in large-scale asset purchases of government
debt and selected private assets, paid for by an expansion in bank reserves – what is commonly referred to
as 'quantitative easing' . And while their open market purchases have typically been sterilised, the ECB’s
8

policy of full allotment in the provision of liquidity means its balance sheet too has expanded substantially in
size (see Chart 6).

Quantitative easing is often described as 'printing money' but this is somewhat misleading, as it conjures up
images of Friedman's monetary helicopter – of which I will say more in a moment. Rather, in our case it
swaps one liability of the state – gilts – for another – claims on the Bank of England in the form of
commercial bank reserves. When we buy a gilt from the private sector, say a pension or hedge fund, we
credit the seller's bank account with the appropriate amount, while their bank simultaneously acquires a
claim on us in the form of an increase in its reserve account. These reserves bear interest at Bank Rate. As
far as a bank is concerned, reserves are a very close substitute for holdings of short-term safe assets, such
as Treasury Bills3.

The aim of quantitative easing is to drive down longer-term yields, when short-term interest rates are already
at or near their floor. It does this by encouraging those who have sold assets to us to rebalance their
portfolios into assets that are substitutes. That includes corporate bonds and equities, as well as a variety of
other assets. There is a line of academic thinking that this mechanism will not be effective if private agents
'pierce the public sector veil' and internalise the tax implications of the change in the composition of the
consolidated public sector balance sheet (Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003). However, event studies of
quantitative easing here (see Joyce et al., 2011) and in the United States (see Gagnon et al., 2011) do
suggest that yields on a range of assets have fallen as a result of the purchases. That can be seen in the
downward pressure on corporate bond yields (Chart 7) and the upward pressure on equity prices (Chart 8)
during the two rounds of asset purchases (marked in grey). So, as yet, we do not seem to be in a liquidity
trap in which yields can be pushed down no further.

What to my mind is a more open question, though, is the degree of traction these lower yields have on
demand at the present juncture. Looser monetary policy works in large part by encouraging households and
businesses to bring forward future spending to the present. It is plausible, however, that such intertemporal
substitution will be weaker when uncertainty is elevated and when banks and some households are
concentrating on repairing their balance sheets. For instance, a modest fall in the cost of capital may do little
to boost investment spending when the environment is so dominated by uncertainty about the outlook for
demand. To illustrate this, Chart 9 shows the results from CBI business surveys of the factors holding back
investment spending at the current juncture. Uncertainty about the outlook for demand is far and away the
dominant factor. That does not mean that quantitative easing is impotent, as demand will still be affected by
the wealth effect from the higher asset prices, as well as by any related exchange rate depreciation. But I
think there are reasons to believe the effect of lower yields may be weaker than usual at the current juncture
(in old speak, the IS curve may be quite steep, even though the LM curve may not be absolutely flat).

There are two differences compared with a Treasury Bill: first, only banks with reserve accounts can hold bank reserves, whereas a
Treasury Bill is a marketable instrument; second, if a bank needs cash, say to meet withdrawals, it can convert its reserve holdings
directly into cash, whereas it would need either to sell or repo its Treasury Bill holdings in the market.

The weakness of the recovery has led some people to suggest that we could increase the effectiveness of
quantitative easing by directing the money used to buy the gilts to buying private sector assets instead, or
else to inject purchasing power more directly by passing it directly to households in the manner of
Friedman's famous helicopter. Such options can always be split into two legs: a fiscal leg, involving some
bond-financed public expenditure and which ought to be subject to the control of the Chancellor and the
Treasury; followed by a second monetary, or financing, leg in which the Bank buys the corresponding
quantity of government debt on the secondary market and is just conventional quantitative easing.

Viewing it this way is, I believe, helpful as it allows one to focus on the merits of the alternative use to which
the funds are put. For instance, the easiest way to implement a ‘helicopter drop’ would be to increase tax
allowances temporarily. But the life cycle/permanent income model of consumption behaviour suggests that
one should expect the vast majority of such a temporary windfall to be saved rather than spent. It certainly is
not the obvious way to try to boost demand, unless one can direct the additional income to credit-constrained
consumers who are more likely to spend it. In any case, the design of any fiscal intervention does not need
to be tied to the question of how the financing is split between money and bonds.

This leads naturally to a related question which has been the object of recent press commentary, namely
should the Bank’s holdings of gilts just be cancelled? The idea is that this would relieve the Government of
having to levy the taxes to pay both the coupons on the gilts and the principal when it falls due. Government
debt would fall at a stroke of the pen, apparently relieving the future burden on the taxpayer.

Unfortunately this is not as good an idea as it sounds. Cancelling the gilts would deprive the Bank of the
assets it needs to sell back to the market in order to suck the bank reserves out when the time comes to
unwind the policy. It would also deprive the Bank of the wherewithal to pay the interest on the reserves in
the mean time, so we would need either to keep Bank Rate perpetually at zero or else be willing to continue
issuing additional reserves indefinitely in order to meet our obligations. One can easily see how this would
eventually lead to inflation taking off4.

In any case, it is not really clear why one would want to go down the route of cancelling the gilts. In
undertaking quantitative easing, we are, for a period, replacing part of the government gilt stock with a
monetary liability paying Bank Rate; cancelling the gilts is tantamount to making that period indefinite. In
contrast, under present arrangements, how long that period lasts will depend on macroeconomic conditions.
The inflation target dictates that we should continue to buy gilts (or other assets), including reinvesting
maturing gilts, so long as inflation is more likely than not to undershoot the inflation target in the medium
term. And it also dictates that we should sell them when inflation is more likely than not to overshoot the
4

It should also be borne in mind that the Asset Purchase Facility, the vehicle through which the gilts are purchased, is indemnified by
the Treasury, while the Treasury will also receive any surplus that results from the transactions. Consequently the coupon payments on
the gilts, net of the interest on the bank reserves used to purchase them, is ultimately owned by the Treasury; they are not ‘lost’ to the
taxpayer in any sense.

target. Making gilt sales/purchases contingent on the economic environment must surely be the right way to
set policy5.

My first seven years at the Bank coincided with one of the most tranquil periods in British macroeconomic
history. The past five years since the eruption of the global financial crisis have been anything but. It has
been a challenging but humbling experience. We knew less than we thought. And we forgot some of the
lessons of history. As a result of the crisis, we have found ourselves providing liquidity support in
unexpected ways, deploying unconventional monetary policies in alien circumstances, and developing a
whole new lexicon of macroprudential policies. Although it will be some time before the post-crisis
adjustment is complete, normality will eventually return. Hopefully we will then be in a position to leave our
successors both wiser and with a better toolkit to deal with similar challenges in the future. Thank you for
your time.

Making the monetary financing permanent by cancelling the gilts independently of the economic environment is essentially a step
towards a world of ‘fiscal dominance’, where fiscal policy constrains monetary policy and ultimately determines the price level, as in the
classic work of Sargent and Wallace (1981).
