1. Introduction
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England has an explicit mandate
to maintain CPI inflation at a target of 2%. In such an inflation targeting regime, the
effectiveness of monetary policy is likely to be greater if inflation expectations remain anchored
to the target. People have to believe that there will be low inflation before they stop building
expectations of high inflation into their decision-making process. A sustained rise in inflation
expectations in the short-term runs the risk of heightened inflationary pressures in the medium
term. Hence, central banks have an incentive to understand how inflation expectations are
formed.
In this paper we review the empirical literature concerning how inflation expectations are
formed. We then examine empirically how individuals form inflation expectations in the UK by
examining micro-data at the level of the individual drawn from a number of UK surveys of
inflation expectations. It extends, and updates, earlier work in Blanchflower and Kelly (2008).
We find strong empirical support for heterogeneity in the formation of inflation expectations. We
make use of data from three main sources: the Bank of England’s Inflation Attitudes Surveys
from 2001-2009; the GfK/NOP Consumer Confidence Barometer Surveys from 1996-2008 and a
2007 Eurobarometer Survey. There are high non-response rates in the surveys. That is, many
respondents have ‘no idea’ what the inflation rate will be in the future. Also, expectations are
backward-looking. Individual’s perceptions of current inflation are a highly significant
determinant of their inflation expectations. However, despite this backward-looking behavior we
still find consistent differences in the formation of inflation expectations according to
characteristics such as education, age, income, employment and housing status.

1

The formation of inflation expectations is likely to be related to the credibility of the
monetary authority in controlling inflation. We therefore also consider micro data on individuals’
satisfaction with the Bank of England in its job to control inflation. We also consider the
characteristics of those individuals more likely to accurately report current rates of inflation and
predict future inflation. We find the credibility of the monetary authority differs across
individuals according to similar characteristics as those that form their inflation expectations and
in their ability to report and predict inflation.
In section 2 we discuss how inflation expectations may be measured and recent
movements in inflation expectations. In section 3 we discuss the empirical literature concerning
the formation of inflation expectations. Section 4 describes the empirical evidence for the UK
drawn from a number of surveys of UK households’ inflation expectations. Section 5 concludes.
2. Measuring Inflation Expectations
What matters most for inflation, are the expectations of those directly involved in setting
prices and wages. Wages are set on an infrequent basis, thus wage setters have to form a view
on future inflation. If inflation is expected to be persistently higher in the future, employees may
seek higher nominal wages in order to maintain their purchasing power. This in turn could lead
to upward pressure on companies’ output prices, and hence higher consumer prices.
Additionally, if companies expect general inflation to be higher in the future, they may be more
inclined to raise prices, believing that they can do so without suffering a drop in demand for their
output. A third path by which inflation expectations could potentially impact inflation is through
their influence on consumption and investment decisions. For a given path of nominal market
interest rates, if households and companies expect higher inflation, this implies lower expected
real interest rates, making spending more attractive relative to saving. But if nominal market

2

interest rates rise in response to expectations that the MPC will raise Bank Rate to curtail any
inflationary pressure, real rates might not actually decline.
How can we measure inflation expectations? Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers (2003) provide
a comprehensive study. We identify three main groups, namely survey-based measures, marketbased measures and economic indicators. In the UK there are a range of surveys of inflation
expectations, both of the general public and professional economic forecasters and academics.
There is a dearth of surveys for firms’ inflation expectations although business surveys include
questions concerning firms’ pricing intentions. In this paper we examine in detail those surveys
of the general public for which we can obtain micro data.
Market-based measures of inflation expectations include estimations of nominal and real
forward interest rate curves, from which a forward inflation curve is inferred, and inflation swap
rates. In both these cases, the indicators may not only reflect markets’ inflation expectations but
also inflation risk premia and numerous other market factors. Movements in inflation
expectations could also be apparent in economic indicators such as wage settlements, where
wage bargainers must make some judgment regarding the course of inflation over the period of
the settlement. Of course, wage settlement data does not simply reflect inflation expectations but
also factors such as ability to pay and employee productivity.
How have the survey measures of inflation expectations we study in this paper behaved
over the recent past. Chart 1 illustrates that a range of survey measures of household’s inflation
expectations have picked up sharply over the recent past, before falling back in the most recent
surveys. Charts 2 and 3 illustrate the median inflation expectation from the Bank of
England/NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey, together with consumer price inflation (CPI) and retail

3

price inflation (RPIX).1 The difference between these two measures is twofold. First, the CPI
measure is calculated using a geometric rather than an arithmetic average. Second, the RPIX
measure includes a measure of housing costs, whereas the CPI does not. Finally, up until the
beginning of 2004 the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) set monetary
policy relative to a target of 2.5% for the RPIX measure. Since 2004 the MPC has set monetary
policy relative to a target of 2.0% for the CPI measure. Hence, this change in target means it is
difficult to judge how inflation expectations have behaved relative to the Bank of England’s
inflation targeting regime. It appears that up to 2004 at least that the median inflation expectation
in the Bank of England Inflation Attitudes survey was closer to the RPIX inflation measure
(Chart 3) than it was to CPI (Chart 2).
Over the recent past RPIX inflation has fallen below CPI inflation, and a third measure of
retail price inflation which includes mortgage interest payments, the RPI, has fallen below zero
following large cuts in the Bank of England’s policy rate (Chart 4). This could suggest that
some agents in the economy may perceive different rates of inflation; in particular, mortgage
holders who will have seen their mortgage interest payments fall sharply in the recent past. Our
survey measures of inflation expectations and perceptions do not specify a particular measure of
inflation. So we must be careful in assessing the behavior of inflation expectations and
perceptions relative to the Bank of England’s target.
Despite these caveats there are a number of key points with respect to the behavior of
inflation expectations we should highlight. First, median inflation expectations remained broadly
stable, in the range of 2%-3%, through the period 1999-2006 as the Bank of England maintained
inflation close to target. Second, during this period inflation expectations moved closely with

inflation perceptions (Chart 5). This could be consistent with backward-looking behavior by
agents in forming their inflation expectations, but also with forward-looking behavior in the
sense that agents expected the Bank of England to maintain inflation close to target.
Third, as rising oil, energy and food prices pushed CPI inflation above the inflation target
to a peak of 5.2% in September 2008, this coincided with a rise in median inflation expectations.
Median inflation expectations picked up sharply, though not as much as actual inflation on all
three measures, through 2007-2008 before falling back very sharply to their lowest level since
2005 in February 2009. Fourth, the survey responses have become more volatile in the last two
years. Charts 6 and 7 illustrate a swathe of distributions of the survey responses to the Bank of
England Inflation Attitudes survey in the periods 2001-2006 and 2007-2009 respectively. Table
1 illustrates the entire distribution of responses. In the May and August 2008 surveys 37% and
36% of respondents expected inflation to be greater than 5% in twelve months time, but this
proportion fell to 21% and 16% in the November 2008 and February 2009 surveys. Between
August and November 2008 the proportion of respondents expecting prices to not change or go
down rose from 6% to 27%.
Hence, in our analysis of the Bank/NOP micro data we consider the behavior of
respondents in two distinct periods. First, in the period when inflation remained close to Bank of
England’s target in 2001-2006 and second, in the period 2007-2009 when inflation has exceeded
the target by more than 1.0pp and the volatility of both inflation and surveyed inflation
expectations has increased.
It is worth considering how wages may have responded to inflation expectations. Chart 8
illustrates that wage settlements showed little response to both the rise in CPI inflation or median
inflation expectations over the course of 2008. Rather, wage growth began to fall back as firms

5

cut back on hiring. And over the recent past sharp cuts in bonuses have pushed down on the AEI
measure of average earnings. In summary, it has been difficult to detect any strong link between
wage settlements, earnings or survey measures of inflation expectations.
3. How are inflation expectations formed?
In the neo-Keynesian model (see, for example, Clarida et al. 2000), sticky prices result in
forward looking behaviour; inflation today is a function of expected future inflation as well as
the pressure of demand, captured in an output gap term. Thus, expectations are deemed to be an
important link in the monetary transmission mechanism. Monetary policy can be more successful
when long-term inflation expectations are well anchored.
Hence, many studies have focused on the question of how to assess the response of
inflation expectations to macroeconomic shocks, and whether this is likely to be lower in
inflation targeting regimes.2 Bernanke (2007) provides an intuitive definition for anchored
inflation expectations, namely that if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their
long run expectation, but their long run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, inflation
expectations can be considered to be well anchored. However, if the public reacts to a short
period of higher than expected inflation by increasing their long run expectations, expectations
are poorly anchored.
Levin, Natalucci and Piger (2004) show that some survey measures of inflation
expectations in the US respond to recent changes in the actual rate of inflation, which would not
be the case if expectations were perfectly anchored.

They examine whether inflation

expectations are relatively more anchored in inflation targeting economies by estimating a
pooled regression (across inflation targeting and non-inflation targeting countries) in order to

2

See for example Stock and Watson (2007).

6

evaluate the sensitivity of inflation expectations to realised inflation. They find that longer-run
inflation expectations have been far less sensitive in inflation targeting countries, suggesting that
inflation targeting central banks have been quite successful in de-linking expectations from
realised inflation. The authors find some evidence that inflation persistence (for core CPI) is
higher amongst non-inflation targeting countries.
In two empirical studies using expectations based on market data Gurnayak et al (2002,
2003) provide evidence that US nominal forward rates at long horizons react significantly to
surprises in macroeconomic data releases and monetary policy announcements, while forward
rates derived from inflation-indexed Treasury debt show little sensitivity to these shocks. This
suggests the response of nominal forward rates is mostly driven by changes in inflation
expectations. However, they note that in the UK long-term forward rates have not demonstrated
excess sensitivity since the Bank of England achieved independence. Mishkin (2007) notes that
in the US inflation persistence rose during the 1970s and has subsequently fallen back consistent
with a re-anchoring of inflation expectations. This hypothesis is consistent with various
indicators of inflation expectations, for example estimates of inflation compensation derived
from indexed Treasury yields.3
However, although there may be some consensus that inflation expectations have become
more anchored, and perhaps more so in inflation targeting countries, these studies do not
explicitly consider how inflation expectations are themselves formed. Rational expectations has
been the traditional framework used for modeling inflation targeting. Agents are assumed to
share a common information set and form expectations conditional on that information. Thus,

3

Similar evidence concerning inflation persistence is found for other countries. Levin and Piger (2004) find that
there has been a significant decline in inflation persistence since the 1980s for major European economies as well as
for Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. However, O’Reilly and Whelan (2005) find little evidence of a
recent decline in persistence for the Euro area as a whole.

7

we assume that everyone has the same expectations. However, this implies the public has firm
knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate. This gives rise to a conflict between policy
practice and policy modeling, which is well described by Orphanides and Williams (2003).
Generally, models assume a fixed and perfectly known structure of the economy and specify that
expectations are model consistent. In linear fixed parameter models, for example, once the
monetary policy rule is specified, inflation expectations can be represented as a fixed linear
function of economic outcomes.

Economic agents are then assumed to form expectations

mechanically based on these simple linear functions of economic outcomes that are assumed to
be perfectly known. In such a world, expectations are perfectly anchored, and as such there is no
need for central banks to monitor and analyse information regarding inflation expectations, and
no need for central bank communications.
However, once imperfect knowledge is acknowledged, the mechanical link from
economic outcomes to the expectations formation process breaks down. There have been a large
number of papers documenting the general failure of the rational expectations hypothesis to
account for the survey data on inflation expectations (for example Pacquet, 1992, Batchelor and
Dua, 1987). A widely cited explanation for the failure is that agents lack the sophistication to
form expectations rationally. The presence of information costs is a major factor. To form
rational expectations, agents must know the time structure and probability distribution of the
economy, and the costs of information may exceed the benefits, making it rational for agents to
form their expectations some other way.

Most empirical tests of rationality of surveyed

expectations have focused on the inflationary expectations of economists (e.g. Keane and
Runkle, 1990), although a few studies have examined inflationary expectations of consumers in
general, mainly using aggregated Michigan survey data (Maddala, Fishe and Lahiri (1981),

8

Gramlich (1983), Batchelor (1986)).

However, these studies suffer from aggregation bias,

meaning that the implications of tests for individual rationality are difficult to derive.
More recently, a few studies have attempted to empirically test rationality of expectation
formation on an individual basis (Bakhshi and Yates (1988) provide a review of tests of
rationality commonly used in the literature).

Souleles (2004), for example, seeks to test

rationality of consumer expectations (including inflation expectations) by looking at the
relationship between answers to the US Michigan survey over a number of years, in order to
capture an individual’s expectational error. They find that expectations appear to have been
biased, but that the bias is inconsistent, and related to inflation regime and business cycle.
In a similar approach to Souleles (2004), Mitchell and Weale (2007) use the British
Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to test the rationality of individual-level expectational data in
Britain. They statistically identify the characteristics of individuals for whom the costs of
forming rational expectations exceed the benefits. They find that the British are more optimistic
about the future when they have recently seen their household income rise, and vice versa.
Using a regime switching model, they find that 40% of individuals form expectations consistent
with rationality, and that the propensity to form rational expectations increases with age rather
than education. However, they do not investigate the alternative model used by the other 60% to
form their expectations.
Another class of study has investigated empirically the increasing consensus that
expectation formation is heterogeneous across agents. Three main possible reasons for this
heterogeneity have been proposed. First, reliance of agents on different models; second, the use
of different information sets by agents; and third, agents have different capacities for processing
information.

Using US Michigan data, Branch (2004) finds evidence that agents rely on

9

different models and use different information sets.

He looks at rationally heterogeneous

expectations, stemming from the notion of Adaptively Rational Equilibrium Dynamics (ARED)
proposed by Brock and Hommes (1997). Under this framework, agents forecast inflation rates
using a predictor function chosen from an increasingly sophisticated set of alternative predictors;
the probability of any predictor being chosen depends on its relative net benefit. His results
show that agents do dynamically select predictor functions.

This suggests that rational

expectations are not rejected because agents blindly follow an ad-hoc rule; rather because it is
not worthwhile for them to invest the effort to use more complex predictor functions. Agents are
rationally heterogeneous in the sense that each predictor choice is individually optimal.
Carroll (2003) focuses on the idea that agents use different data sets to form expectations.
He proposes an epidemiology framework to study how households model inflation expectations.
In the framework, household expectations are updated probabilistically towards the views of
professional forecasters – i.e. people obtain macroeconomic news from the media, but that it
takes time to dissipate. He finds differences between household expectations and the views of
professional forecasters narrow when inflation is more significant, probably because of increased
media coverage and household interest. His model is successful in capturing much of the
variation in the Michigan survey measures of inflation expectations.
Models of learning allow us to abstract from the idea that agents have full information
about the economy and the objectives of the central bank; instead individuals make statistical
inferences about the unknown parameters governing the evolution of the economy. Pfajfar and
Santoro (2006) focus on learning and information stickiness as the roots of the heterogeneity in
expectation formation between agents. Using data from the Michigan survey, they identify three
regions of a distribution corresponding to different expectation formation processes, which

10

display a heterogeneous response to the main macroeconomic indicators. On the left hand side
of the distribution, a static or lightly autoregressive group, in the middle a nearly rational group,
and on the right hand side a group of agents behaving according to adaptive learning and sticky
information. The latter respond in too pessimistic a manner, overacting to macroeconomic
fluctuations.

Similar to Carroll (2003), they find that agents are more likely to update

information sets regularly when inflation matters. Pfajfar and Santoro (2008) extend this
approach to different demographic groups. They find that income, education and gender are
important characteristics when forecasting inflation. Those with higher income, education and
male agents tend to make smaller errors in their inflation forecasts.
Orphanides and Williams (2003) also look at the implications of learning. They find that
the presence of learning increases the sensitivity of inflation expectations and the term structure
of interest rates to economic shocks, in line with empirical evidence. They find that inflation
expectations under learning are much less sensitive to inflation when the inflation target is
assumed to be known by the public, indicating that the benefit of better anchored inflation
expectations that is associated with successful communication of the central bank’s inflation
target can be significant. This is consistent with the experience of the UK following the adoption
of inflation targeting.
4. Empirical evidence
We now turn to empirical evidence on the formation of inflation expectations among the
UK population. Survey responses may be highly influenced by the structure and precise nature of
the questions asked. So we consider evidence from a range of surveys conducted in the UK
where respondents provide quantitative, qualitative and point estimates for their inflation
expectations. We find consistent characteristics such as age, education and relative income

11

influence the formation of inflation expectations. Of course, inflation expectations should be
highly influenced by monetary policy. We find that similar characteristics, as those that lead to
lower inflation expectations, are also associated with confidence in the Bank of England to
control inflation.
4.1. The Bank of England/NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey: Inflation Expectations
Since 1999 the Bank of England has conducted a regular survey of attitudes to inflation
expectations. Each survey covers around 2000 individuals, with an additional 2000 taking part in
an extended survey every February. The sample is designed and weighted to ensure that it is
representative of the known population data on age, gender, social class and region. Aggregated
data are available quarterly from November 19994. We have obtained the micro data at the level
of the individual from twenty seven of these quarterly surveys, beginning in February 2001
through to February 2009. These are not panels; the same people are not interviewed repeatedly,
rather they are repeat cross-sections. We have pooled these surveys together. In total there are
64,334 responses. In each survey the following question is asked "How much would you expect
prices in the shops generally to change over the next 12 months?” The full distribution of
responses is presented in Table 1.
The median response has risen from a low of 1.7% in November 2001 to a high of 4.4%
in August 2008, but has fallen back very sharply to 2.1% in the February 2009 survey. Chart 5
suggests that up to 2007 median inflation expectations had been largely backward-looking.
Indeed, up to 2007 on average 49.9% of respondents indicated that their expectations for
inflation were in the same range as their perceptions of current inflation. This may not be too

4

Summaries of the aggregate responses in each survey are available on the Bank of England's website. On a yearly
basis since 2001 the Bank of England has published an article in its Quarterly Bulletin discussing the results of the
survey - the latest available is Benford and Driver (2008).

12

surprising in a period when the Bank of England succeeded in maintaining inflation close to
target. Given the costs of predicting inflation, imperfect information sets and capacity to form
such projections a backward-looking rule of thumb may not have been irrational when consumer
price inflation was relatively stable.
Since the beginning of 2007 median inflation expectations have diverged from
perceptions (Chart 5) at the same time that consumer price inflation has become more volatile.
Similarly, the distribution of survey responses has become more volatile since 2007 (Charts 6
and 7). We therefore consider which groups may be more or less backward-looking in forming
their inflation expectations? This is clearly related to a second question in the Bank of England
Inflation Attitudes survey which we also consider: “Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you
with the way the Bank of England is doing its job to set interest rates in order to control
inflation?”
It is important to examine the distribution of non-responses because if it is non-random it
may bias any results. Table 2 illustrates the non-responses to the inflation expectations question.
The equation estimated is a dprobit to calculate the probability that respondents will reply that
they have ‘no idea’.5 If the respondent reported they had 'no idea' the dependent variable was set
to one, zero otherwise. Worryingly the probability of a non-response is higher for females, the
young, the less educated, those on lowest incomes, not in employment and those renting

5

Dprobit in STATA fits maximum-likelihood probit models and is an alternative to probit. Rather than reporting
the coefficients, dprobit reports the marginal effect, that is the change in the probability for an infinitesimal change
in each independent, continuous variable and, by default, reports the discrete change in the probability for dummy
variables.

13

accommodation6. The concern is that any results may be biased because of the relative exclusion
of these groups. So we proceed with caution.
Table 3 moves on to model inflation expectations econometrically, using the micro data
from the Inflation Attitudes survey from February 2001 through to February 20097. The
dependent variable is expected inflation twelve months ahead. All respondents reporting they
had 'no idea' are dropped. Because there are open ends and intervals within the survey responses
the procedure used here is interval regression. A positive coefficient means the individual
expects higher prices and vice versa. The model is consistently estimated by a maximum
likelihood procedure. We have micro data available on around 60,000 individuals from twenty
seven sweeps of the survey extending from February 2001. There are approximately 2,500 leftcensored observations, 10,000 right-censored observations and 47,000 interval observations.
In the first column of Table 3 we simply include survey month dummies. A number of
facts stand out: first, there is relatively little movement in the size of the coefficients on the
month dummies up to the period 2007-2009. Second, there was a dramatic increase in the size of
the coefficients as the impact of the oil shock hit from November 2007 to August 2008. Third,
the rapid deterioration in the size of the coefficients in the last two surveys. February 2009 is
insignificantly different from February 2001. Column 2 adds controls for age, gender, education,
employment and housing status. It is striking that the time series patterns of the survey date
dummies change little. Inflation expectations tend to rise with age up to 65. The least educated
and those in rented accommodation also report higher expected inflation rates. There is no

Unfortunately we do not have responses according to income for all of the surveys. In alternative specifications of
the dprobit those on lower incomes have higher non-response rates. The tables for these exercises are available upon
request.

The February surveys are twice as large as the surveys in a particular year: the February surveys have
approximately 4,000 respondents compared with approximately 2,000 in other months.

14

significant difference in the inflation expectations of workers and non-workers. Males tend to
have higher inflation expectations, but we take this result with caution as it is not robust across
different specifications of the equation, and subject to the caveat regarding the non-responses of
females.
What can we say about the recent divergence in perceptions and expectations of
inflation? Column 3 re-estimates the equation in column 2 but restricts itself to data taken from
the most recent survey in February 2009.8 The main difference between the coefficients on the
control variables is the big increase in the absolute size of the coefficient for those individuals
who have a mortgage who may have seen big declines in their mortgage interest payments
following cuts in the Bank of England’s policy rate.
The coefficients on education dummies are more negative in February 2009 than in the
earlier period. This could suggest that those with higher education are less likely to base their
inflation expectations on their perceptions of current inflation, especially at a time when inflation
has fallen back sharply from a peak of 5.2% in late 2008. We discuss this in more detail below.
Column 4 tests for whether the differences observed between the coefficients in columns
2 and 3 are significant by including a set of interaction terms between the control variables and
the February 2009 dummy. Experiments were done with interactions with other variables that
were always insignificant and hence were omitted. The evidence is that mortgage holders, men
and the more educated have significantly lower expectations in February 2009 than previously.
Column 5 now adds the perceptions of inflation over the preceding twelve month period.
Interestingly 49% of individuals gave exactly the same response to the question on perceptions
as they did on their expectations on average over 2001-2009. This fell to 32% in February 2009.

8

These data were unavailable to Blanchflower and Kelly (2008).

15

It is not surprising then that perceptions of past inflation are a major determinant of perceptions.
However, even when controlling for inflation perceptions the impact of gender, age, education
and employment and housing status identified in previous regressions are robust.
Furthermore, the interaction terms for the February 2009 survey remain significant. This
suggests that these groups lowered their expectations more quickly than other groups, perhaps
because their expectations are less backward-looking. We investigate this hypothesis further by
conducting similar regressions, where we restrict the observations to each category of
educational attainment. Table 4 illustrates that perceptions of current inflation have less of an
influence on inflation expectations than for those with higher education. The coefficients in
column 1 for inflation perceptions are significantly smaller than those in column 3 when the
same regression is conducted on those with the highest educational attainment. Of course, using
inflation perceptions as a rule of thumb in forming inflation expectations may be more rational
when inflation is close to target, and there is confidence in the monetary authority to maintain
inflation close to that target. However, over the recent past inflation has been volatile. So when
inflation exceeds the target such a rule of thumb may be less successful in accurately forming
inflation expectations. Columns 4-6 illustrate that over the recent past inflation expectations have
had a much smaller influence on the inflation expectations of the most educated. Indeed, for this
group inflation perceptions are not significant, or have only a marginal significance. This could
suggest that those with higher educational attainment are less likely to be backward-looking in
the formation of their inflation expectations. Chart 9 helps illustrate this behavior by plotting
median inflation expectations by educational attainment. In the very latest survey, February
2009, median inflation expectations for those with the highest educational attainment were 1.3pp

16

lower than those with the lowest educational attainment. Over the period 2001-2009 this gap had
averaged just 0.4pp.
4.2 The GfK/NOP Consumer Confidence Barometer
Micro data on inflation expectations in the UK are also available from a further data
source. The GfK/NOP Consumer Confidence Barometer (CCB) survey collects nationally
representative data for those aged 16+ from a random sample of telephone owning households.
Sample sizes are approximately 2000 per month. These data are collected monthly across each
member state of the European Union, and for the UK are available since 1985.9 We have only
obtained access to the micro-data since 1996.
The main aim of the GfK CCB survey is to monitor the general public's confidence in the
British economy; measuring consumer confidence in the present economic climate in the UK,
and consumer expectations for the year ahead. We have obtained access to the micro data from
the CCB survey taken monthly from January 1996 through October 2008, making 154 monthly
surveys in all and a total of 312,599 observations. In the CCB survey respondents are asked a
slightly different, qualitative, question on price expectations to the one used in the Bank of
England’s Inflation Attitudes survey: "Q6. In comparison with the past 12 months, how do you
expect consumer prices will develop in the next 12 months? They will…increase more rapidly;
increase at the same rate: increase at a slower rate; stay about the same; fall or don’t know."
The distribution of the responses is reported in Table 5. It is evident that non-responses
are much lower than in the Bank of England Inflation Attitudes survey, on average 5% report

9

GfK has been conducting a monthly consumer survey called the Consumer Confidence Barometer (CCB) in the
UK since June 1995. GfK carries out this survey on behalf of the European Commission, who sponsors the same
consumer survey in all EU and EU candidate countries, as part of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business
and Consumer programme (known as the BCS programme). The BCS program was first launched by the European
Commission in 1961 (although the programme did not extend to the consumer sector until 1972).

17

that they don’t know. This is consistent with the well known problem in social science research non-responses tend to be higher when quantitative responses are asked for – more accuracy is
obtained at the price of lower response rates. As in the Inflation Attitudes Survey the CCB
survey indicates inflation expectations rose sharply through 2007 up to August 2008 but then fell
sharply. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 describe the estimates from an ordered logit where 1 is set
to equal a fall while 5 means 'increase more rapidly', so a positive coefficient implies a higher
increase and vice versa for a negative coefficient. An ordered logit fits the responses to an
ordinal or qualitative variable.

The actual values taken on by the dependent variable are

irrelevant, except that larger values are assumed to correspond to 'higher' outcomes.10 The 'no
ideas' respondents are excluded. The controls available from the survey are region, age, gender
and work status. We include eleven year dummies and month dummies for 2008. In column 2
we also include controls for the respondents views on what had happened to prices over the
preceding twelve months, including the 'no ideas'.11
Males believe that prices will rise more slowly than females as do the more highly
educated compared to the less highly educated. This contrasts with the evidence from the Bank
of England Inflation Attitudes Survey where males expect higher rates of increase. Consistent
with the findings from the Inflation Attitudes survey, expectations are higher among older age
groups, females and the least educated. We also find that expectations are higher among nonworkers and in London. As in the Inflation Attitudes Survey individuals’ perceptions of inflation
are a highly significant determinant of their expectations (column 2).

10

Use of ordered logits is commonplace in the analysis of happiness data which is similarly ordered - see
Blanchflower and Oswald (2004).

11

We also experimented with replacing the year and month dummies with the monthly CPI. In this case there are
154 separate monthly observations, but when the standard errors were clustered this variable was always
insignificant whether or not there were year or month dummies included. Hence the variable was dropped.

18

Since 2003 the CCB has asked two additional questions where respondents provide point
estimates of inflation expectations and perceptions: “Estimate by how much consumer prices will
rise by over next 12 months. Estimate up to 1dp?” and “estimate of how much consumer prices
have risen by over past 12 months. Estimate up to 1dp". Interestingly, 44.7% of respondents
reported zero as their answer to the inflation expectations question, while 5.7% reported
estimates between 20% and 100%. For the second question on inflation perceptions 42.2% of
respondents reported zero as their answer. The concern here is that people believed they were
reporting on changes in inflation rather than in prices.

Column 3 estimates an Ordinary Least

Squares (OLS) regression with the dependent variable the exact inflation rate expected. Column
4 includes the perception of the rate over the last twelve months. Column 5 excludes anyone who
reported a zero to either question. Hence sample size is approximately halved. This exercise
provides further evidence that inflation expectations are backward-looking and that the least
educated, non-workers and males tend to have lower inflation expectations.
4.3: The Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey: Satisfaction with the Monetary
Authority
The success of an inflation targeting regime is grounded in the credibility of the central
bank, and the ability of the central bank to educate those whose expectations in turn impact
monetary policy. The Bank of England Inflation Attitudes survey includes a question intended
to capture confidence amongst the general public in the monetary authority to control inflation:
“how satisfied are you with how the Bank of England is doing its job to set interest rates to
control inflation?” Responses ranged from very dissatisfied; dissatisfied; neither; satisfied and
very satisfied plus ‘no idea’. Of course, the risk of analyzing survey responses to this question is
that they may be confused by other factors such as the impact of monetary policy on changes on

19

mortgage interest payments, or the broader macroeconomic factors such as the unemployment
rate.
Table 7 reports the views of respondents in the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes
Surveys to this question. Overall, a far greater proportion of respondents have been consistently
satisfied, or very satisfied with the job the Bank of England has been doing than those saying
they were not satisfied. But since the end of 2006 the proportion of respondents reporting
dissatisfaction with the Bank of England has been rising sharply. This period coincides both with
rising inflation but also with the adverse impact on the broader economy from the credit crunch.
As with the inflation expectations question, it is important to consider the non-response
rates in case they may be biased. On average, thirteen percent of respondents said they had 'no
idea' how well the Bank was doing in controlling inflation. Interestingly, this total fell to a low of
just 9% in the most recent February 2009 survey. A comparison with Table 2 illustrates that
similar groups did not respond to the satisfaction question, as in the inflation expectations
question: females, the young, the least educated and those in rented accommodation. Table 8
uses the micro data pooled across the eight years 2001-2009 to estimate an ordered logit and
includes controls for age, gender, schooling, housing tenure; working or not working, year
dummies and region of residence. A positive coefficient thus implies an individual is more
satisfied and a negative one implies less satisfied. Individuals who reported they had 'no idea' are
excluded and hence sample size is now just over fifty-six thousand in column 1.
Column 1 of Table 8 suggests that satisfaction with the Bank of England is lower among
women, those in rented accommodation, the least educated and the young. Satisfaction rises with
age. These results are stable across the various specifications. Interestingly, satisfaction with how
the Bank is doing its job rises linearly with age, being highest with those aged 65 and over.

20

Satisfaction is higher among home owners and lower among renters. The time dummies suggest
growing dissatisfaction with the Bank's performance over time. With the exception of age, it
appears that those groups who expect lower inflation, even after taking account of their inflation
perceptions, such as home owners and the more educated are also those groups that are more
likely to believe the Bank of England is able to control inflation.
How do we interpret the recent deterioration in satisfaction with the Bank of England?
The interaction terms indicate that satisfaction has fallen across all age groups, education is not
significant and that mortgage holders are less dissatisfied with the Bank. This could be because
the recent responses reflect broader macroeconomic developments such as the credit crisis and
falling mortgage interest payments rather than a lack of confidence in the Bank to meet the
inflation target.
4.4 Accuracy in reporting current inflation and predicting inflation
In this section we examine the degree of individuals’ knowledge of the 'official' inflation
rate using retrospective data from the Eurobarometer Survey #67.2: European Union
Enlargement, Personal Data Privacy, the National Economy, and Scientific Research, April-May
2007. This survey was conducted across all EU countries but we restrict ourselves to the
approximately 1300 observations on UK residents. Given that inflation perceptions play a large
role in the formation of inflation expectations, to the extent those perceptions capture the true
inflation rate will be important. We then use data from the February 2005, 2006 and 2007 Bank
of England Inflation Attitude Surveys to determine the accuracy of respondent's predictions of
what will happen to prices over the following twelve months compared to the actual observed
outcomes.
a) Inflation in 2006

21

In the Eurobarometer survey respondents were asked the following question - "What was the
official inflation rate, the rate of which consumer prices increased or decreased, in 2006? I can
tell you that the exact figure is between -1% and 20%?". It is possible to compare the responses
to this question with the actual inflation rates, although it is uncertain precisely which rate is
being referred to. In 2006 the CPI averaged 2.3% while the RPI averaged 3.2%. To allow some
margin of error we assume a response was 'correct' and set to zero if the response was in the
interval of 1.3% to 4.2%, zero otherwise. Individuals who did not know were also set to zero.
According to this criterion 25.9% of respondents reported correctly. In column 1 of Table 9 we
report a dprobit modeling the probability of an individual reporting the correct answer. The
probability of doing so is higher the higher the level of education, among men, and is higher
among workers especially among employed professionals and managers. The probability rises in
an inverted U-shape in age maximizing at age 59 and declining thereafter.
b) Inflation in 2006 compared with inflation in 2005.
Respondents were also asked a further question on inflation – "Do you think that the inflation
rate in 2006 was higher, lower or equal to the one in 2005?" Given that both the CPI and the RPI
were lower in 2005 (2.1% and 2.8% respectively), in column 2 of Table 9 we model the
probability of an individual reporting that inflation in 2006 was higher than it had been in 2005
using the Eurobarometer data once again. Analogously to the reports on the level of inflation,
males, the more highly educated workers and especially managers were more likely to be
'correct'.
c) Predicting inflation twelve months ahead
In Table 10 we examine the probability that an individual in the Bank of England survey
‘correctly’ forecasts what inflation will be twelve months ahead. We do this using the February

22

surveys of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 and then compare these responses with the percentage
change in prices that occurred over the next twelve months. A 'correct' response is taken to be
within a 1% interval of the CPI on the low side (CPI was 2.0% in February 2006, 2.8% in
February 2007 and 2.5% in February 2008) and a 1% interval on the high side for the RPI (2.4%;
4.6% and 4.1% respectively).

Columns 1 through 3 are for February 2005 through 2007

respectively while column 4 pools the three years and adds two year dummies. As was found
above, the probability of being 'correct' is higher among males, home owners, workers, the more
educated, richer individuals, those aged 55-64 and residents of the South East.
5. Conclusions
What are the conclusions from our findings? First, there is evidence that significant
numbers of individuals do not know what the inflation rate is, how it has changed and are unable
to predict how it might change in the future. This is consistent with recent evidence from the
United States suggesting very low levels of financial literacy. Second, there are high nonresponse rates to those surveys on how satisfied respondents are with the Bank of England in its
role in controlling inflation. Non-responses are especially high among the least educated,
females, the poorest individuals and the young. So at least for some groups their inflation
expectations, either implicit or explicit, are unlikely to be anchored to the inflation target.
We find that age, gender, income, housing status and education are important
characteristics in forming inflation expectations12. The more highly educated and those with
higher incomes are more optimistic about the path of prices, believing they will rise at a slower
pace than younger, less educated and less affluent individuals.

12

Unfortunately we do not have responses according to income for all of the surveys. In alternative specifications of
the interval regressions those on lower incomes tend to have higher inflation expectations, and those on higher
incomes lower inflation expectations. The tables for these exercises are available upon request.

23

We find that price expectations are backward-looking. Perceptions of current inflation are
highly significant determinant of inflation expectations. However, perceptions of inflation are a
less important consideration for the more highly educated. Similarly, the most educated are more
likely to be satisfied that the Bank of England in its role in controlling inflation. This could help
explain both their lower inflation expectations and why perceptions of inflation are less
important in determining their inflation expectations.
These results are similar to those of Pfajfar and Santoro (2008) with respect to
demographic factors that influence inflation expectations as measured by the University of
Michigan survey for the U.S who found that males, the more highly educated and those with
higher incomes are more likely to accurately report the current level of, and predict inflation.
The main explanations for heterogeneity in the formation of inflation expectations that
have been proposed in the literature are that agents rely on different models, may have different
information sets, or have different capacities for processing information. The results presented in
this paper regarding the more highly educated provide some justification for this approach. First,
perceptions of current inflation are less important for this group in their forecasts for inflation in
the future. Second, intuitively we would expect this group can employ more sophisticated
models in forming their expectations, and may have a greater capacity to process information.
Hence, this paper provides empirical support for models of heterogeneity in inflation
expectations formation.

Notes: excluded age <25; own outright: GCSE, Feb05. CPI in February 2006 2.0%;
February 2007 2.8%, February 2008 2.5% and February 2009 3.2%. RPI in February
2006 2.4%; February 2007 4.6%, February 2008 4.1% and February 2009 0%.
Responses are assumed 'correct' if they are with 1 percentage point of the outturn. Hence
in the final column a correct answer is within 1 percentage point either side of the CPI
and the RPI. Hence scored as correct in 2005 if inflation in range >=1% and <5%.
Scored as correct in 2006 as 1% to between 3% and 4%. Scored as correct in 2007 if
inflation in range 1% to over 5%. Scored as correct in February 2009 if inflation
expectations in range >=-1% and <5%. T-statistics in parentheses.
