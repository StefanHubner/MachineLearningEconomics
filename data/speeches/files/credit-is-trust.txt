CREDIT IS TRUST
It is good to be back in Yorkshire. I say back because I grew up around 10 miles
north of here. When I left over 20 years ago, Leeds looked and felt very different to
today. Nowhere is the contrast greater than in the financial sector. In 1995, almost
74,000 people were employed in financial and related business services, accounting
for around 20% of employment in Leeds. By 2009 this had risen to over 116,000, or
around 30% of employment. Today, Leeds has a legitimate claim to be the UK’s
second largest financial centre.

A Short History of Banking in Yorkshire

The foundations for this success were laid much earlier. The history of banking in
Yorkshire dates back over 250 years.1 Pease and Co of Hull, established in 1754, are
thought to be Yorkshire’s oldest private bank. In the same decade, banks were
founded in Leeds and Bradford. By the end of the 18th century, Yorkshire had a wellestablished network of over 40 banks in around 16 regional towns and cities.
In the first two decades of the 19th century, private banking in Yorkshire continued to
thrive, spreading to around 30 towns and cities. The financial crisis of 1825 brought
an end to this rapid growth. The crisis itself was interesting for its parallels with
today. It was sourced in sub-prime lending in (in this case South) America. As fears
of loan losses rose, runs began on banks throughout England, with more than a dozen
institutions failing in Yorkshire alone.

The crisis brought reform of the banking industry in the form of the Joint Stock
Banking Act of 1826. This removed the Bank of England’s monopoly on joint stock
banking. This had long been a bone of contention among country banks, not least in
Yorkshire. The Bank of England itself opened its first branch in Yorkshire - here in
Leeds, in fact - the following year in 1827. This was acknowledgement of Leeds’
emerging importance as a financial centre. Yet the reception it received was, to say
the least, somewhat mixed.

Local newspapers and businessmen attacked the Bank’s attempt to spread its
“pestilential branches” into the regions.2 Bank of England notes were shunned by
local shopkeepers. The landlady of the Esk Inn near Whitby did so with the words:

“I’ll ha’ nought to do with them things, I know nought about them; now if it
had been a Simpson I would ha’ changed it with pleasure”3
It is easy to imagine, though probably impossible to print, what she might have made
of Quantitative Easing.

In the period since, banking and finance in Yorkshire have grown steadily and
successfully. Among the success stories would be the Yorkshire Penny Bank. This
was founded in 1859 in Halifax as a means of saving for the working classes. In
1874, its first School Transfer Department was opened to encourage saving by school
children. “Take care of the Pence and the Pounds will take care of themselves”
intoned the bank’s posters.

Such was the success of the school scheme that, by the end of the nineteenth century,
the majority of schoolchildren in Yorkshire had a savings account. The scheme aimed
to educate children from an early age on the benefits of thrift and financial planning.
And having been nurtured early, the relationship between bank and customer often
lasted a lifetime. In 1959, the Yorkshire Penny Bank became Yorkshire Bank which
today remains one of the UK’s most successful medium-sized banks.
The mutual or building society sector’s roots in Yorkshire are just as deep.4 Although
the first societies appeared in the Midlands in around 1775, within a decade Yorkshire
had established its first society, the Hill House Bank Building Club in 1785. By the
end of the century, numbers had swelled to around 50, mostly in the Midlands,
Lancashire and Yorkshire.

The early mutuals pooled savings to buy property for members and terminated once
all members’ housing needs were satisfied – so-called “terminating societies”. In
1844, “permanent societies” were permitted, which allowed for a revolving set of both
savers and borrowers. But the mutuality principle remained – “to enable a working
man to secure himself in the course of a few years a dwelling-house as his own
freehold property, as a home for himself and family.”5
Numbers of mutuals grew rapidly during the 19th century, reaching around 850 by
1850 and over 1500 by 1875, with almost 100 in Yorkshire alone. Here in Leeds, the
Leeds and Holbeck Permanent Building Society was founded in 1875 and, having
been renamed Leeds Building Society in 2005, it remains in the top 10 building
societies by size nationally. Consolidation and, latterly, demutualization have
reduced numbers over the past few decades. Today, there are only a handful of
independent, indigenous mutuals in the region. But they remain some of the strongest
in the country.

The success of Yorkshire’s financial sector over this lengthy period is no fluke. A
reading of history reveals the same successful recipe being repeated. An awareness
of, and responsiveness to, the needs of the customer, whether saver or borrower. A
focus on long-term relationship-building, often starting from the earliest age. A
recognition of the benefits of mutualising both risks and returns. In short, the
importance of banks being built, first and foremost, on trust.

The Crisis of Trust

From the past, then, to the present. A year ago almost to the day, the investment bank
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States. Activity across the globe,
financial and non-financial, froze. Recently, there are indications of some thawing.
But a year on, many economies around the world remain mired in recession. What
explains the severity of this crisis and how much longer can it be expected to last?

The words “credit crunch” contain the seeds of an explanation. In Latin, credit means
trust. So credit crunch is, in essence, a breakdown in trust. Between different parties
at different times, that loss of trust has been the root cause of the devastating impact
felt globally since the credit crunch began. It also explains why the road to recovery
in credit, and thus in the real economy, may be long and winding. In essence, events
of the past two years can be re-told as a story of the progressive breakdown in trust.

The proximate cause of the crisis was a breakdown of trust between banks and
households, specifically sub-prime mortgage-holders in the United States. The upshot
was a loss of credit, and in many cases the homes, of these borrowers from 2006
onwards. Repossession rates on US mortgages have more than tripled in the past two
years (Chart 1). UK arrears and default rates, although lower, are rising. Some
borrowers are now rationed out of the mortgage market. In July 2007, there were
around 9500 sub-prime mortgage products being advertised in the UK. Today, there
are virtually none (Chart 2).

As losses on these mortgages and other toxic assets accumulated, trust among banks
was impaired. This saw a seizing-up of inter-bank money markets from the second
half of 2007 onwards. Before the crisis, banks required about 10 basis points of
compensation for making a three-month loan to one another (Chart 3). By September
2007, that compensation premium had risen tenfold to around 100 basis points. By
September 2008, it had risen more than thirty-fold from pre-crisis levels. It has since
fallen back to around 35 basis points. These persistent funding pressures have
constrained banks’ ability to lend to the real economy.

Damaged by losses on assets and constrained by funding costs, questions began to be
raised during 2008 about banks’ future profitability and, in some cases, viability. The
equity prices of banks tumbled, falling 86% on average for the major UK banks
between February 2007 and March this year (Chart 4). In money terms, that is a loss
of market capitalisation of around £300bn, equivalent to 20% of annual UK GDP.
Underlying these price falls was a generalised loss of trust between banks and
investors in banks, such as sovereign wealth funds and mutual funds.

5

What explained this wholesale loss of trust? In the run-up to the crisis, banks’
business models were increasingly predicated on making loans for onward sale.
Loans became tradable securities and long-term relationships gave way to short-term
transactions. The perils of this practice were well understood by Michael Marks,
founder of Marks and Spencer and of course one of the region’s greatest-ever
entrepreneurs: “You either make things or you sell them. Don’t try both”.

Banks tried both, making loans with an eye to subsequently selling them. This had
unintended, but in fact entirely predictable, consequences. Without skin in the game,
banks’ due diligence became slipshod. The quality of tradable loans fell as their
quantity rose.

Investors in these securities were not as canny as the landlady of the Esk Inn: they
purchased them in size even though “they knew nought about them”. By the time the
penny had dropped for these investors, the pounds had not taken care of themselves.
Global losses on these securitised assets are now believed to lie anywhere up to £3
trillion.6 As losses accumulated, trust in these securities was undermined and with it
trust in the banks issuing them.

As credit was cut, trust in the viability of some non-financial companies was
questioned. Corporate distress began to rise internationally during the course of 2008.
And as corporate distress rose, in particular after the failure of Lehman Brothers,
distrust between companies mounted. The stream of trade credit extended between
firms dried to a trickle at the end 2008 and in the first part of 2009. At that time, a
survey by the Bank’s regional agents reported that around a quarter of contacts had
had to turn down potentially profitable orders as a result of tighter trade credit.

This progressive hardening of the credit arteries also had dramatic effects between
countries. Cross-border flows of credit have reversed dramatically in the past year.
“Home bias” by investors – a lack of trust in foreign investments - has returned with a
vengeance. Cross-border lending by international banks grew by 20% per year

6

For example, Bank of England Financial Stability Report, June 2009.

between 2003 and 2007. In 2008, it fell 5% (Chart 5). This has had adverse effects
on UK companies, around a third of whose borrowing comes from foreign lenders.

Through these successive waves, the world financial system found itself with almost
every link in the credit chain – in the chain of trust - having been weakened or broken.
That is evident in surveys of the public’s trust in industry: banking and finance are
firmly rooted to the foot of the league table of trust, in the UK and internationally
(Chart 6). That loss of trust is mirrored in aggregate bank lending in the UK, in
particular to companies, where annual growth has fallen from a peak of 23% in March
2008 to around zero now (Chart 7). And this has in turn been reflected in the largest
and most synchronous global economic slowdown since the Great Depression.

Confidence and Credit

So how is trust, and thereby credit, to be restored? To date, the answer has been to
rely on the one sector whose credit has not been seriously questioned - governments
and central banks. There has been large-scale provision of government and central
bank credit over the past two years in an attempt to ease pressures and shore up breaks
in the private sector credit chain.

These interventions have been unprecedented in size during peacetime. The total
potentially on the table is in excess of $14 trillion.7 That is roughly $2000 for every
man, woman and child on the planet. Half of the world’s 20 largest banks have
needed direct government support. Central bank balance sheets in the major financial
centres, including in the UK, have more than doubled in size. And deposit insurance
schemes have been extended in at least 40 countries around the world.

Extending public sector credit on this scale relies on the deep pockets and prudence of
our grandchildren. It can be no more than a stop-gap – a temporary bridge - until
private sector trust can be restored. So far, the bridge has served its purpose. There
are signs over recent months from surveys that confidence is returning to banks, non-

financial companies and consumers. And there have been some signs of a turnaround
in the housing, equity and some debt markets.

It has been said that every recession in history has been associated with a collapse in
confidence.8 This time’s was plainly no exception. So with confidence turning can
we anticipate an imminent return of credit to the economy?

Rising confidence among firms and consumers is a necessary condition for recovery.
But it is questionable whether it is sufficient. That is because confidence and trust are
subtly different concepts.9 Confidence derives from observable, authoritative proof.
At the time of the failure of Lehman Brothers, people struggled to make sense of the
state of the economy and financial system. Without a compass, they lost their
financial bearings. Lacking authoritative proof, confidence collapsed. As the banking
system has since stabilised, people’s bearings have returned and with them
confidence.

Trust is an altogether different animal. It is based on beliefs, not observable proofs.
It is grounded in perceptions rather than evidence. It is as much a psychological state
as a financial one.10 A clean balance sheet might instil confidence, but it need not
repair trust. Because it is a moral judgement, repairing trust can be a slow and
painstaking business. Moral compasses take rather longer to self-correct than
magnetic ones. This has implications for the path of recovery in the period ahead.

Historically, credit has tended to lag the recovery in output in the majority of
recessions, especially financial recessions. During the previous three major
recessions in the UK – in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s – credit to business recovered
slowly and in some cases only several years after the recovery in activity (Charts 8, 9
and 10). This is consistent with trust between financial institutions and their
customers being slower to recover than confidence more generally.

theories and evidence (“Addressing the Psychology of Financial Markets”, Institute for Public Policy

Moreover, unlike the situation today, earlier recessions in the UK were not primarily
the result of financial factors. International evidence suggests that financial
recessions have tended on average to be both costlier and lengthier.11 Normal
recessions have been associated with a recovery in output to its previous peak after
around 3 ½ quarters. Recovery to peak output following financial recessions has on
average taken around 5 ½ quarters (Chart 11).

Like its predecessors, lack of confidence may have “caused” this time’s recession.
But it is lack of trust – and hence credit – that may shape the recovery. Based on past
evidence, as the Governor has noted recently, we might anticipate a protracted period
of repair.

Repairing Trust – The Low Road to Reform

So what might be needed, beyond time, to repair trust in the financial system? A raft
of reforms to the financial system, nationally and internationally, is currently being
assembled. These measures will aim to strengthen banks’ financial resources, risk
management practices and governance. They are about bringing regulatory rules into
the 21st century.

This is the high road to reform – for example, higher buffers of capital and liquidity
and higher standards of risk management. If successful, these reforms will help
cleanse bank balance sheets. It is an open question, however, whether these efforts
will be sufficient to restore public trust in the financial system.

One reason why regulation might not be the whole answer is that trust in financial
regulation is itself one of the casualties of crisis. Regulation is seen by some as part
of the problem, not the solution. More generally, in repairing public trust, it would be
preferable if banks were seen to be initiating root and branch reform themselves,
rather than having it thrust upon them by regulators.

Kenneth Rogoff (2008), NBER Working Paper No.13761.

This would be the low road to reform. Low because it would not require any new or
complex regulatory apparatus. Low because it would not need international
negotiation or agreement on the contractual fineprint. Instead, what it would require
is a self-generated sea-change in the structure and strategy of banking.

So what changes in structure and strategy might be desirable? Without suggesting
definitive answers, let me discuss three areas where further debate might be useful:
banks’ size in relation to the services they provide; banks’ strategy in relation to their
resilience; and banks’ governance in relation to the incentives this creates.
•

Structure - size versus service provision

Economies of scale typically arise in the production of goods and services which are
homogenous and replicable. Henry Ford applied this principle to car manufacture
through his Ford Motor Company, established almost a century ago. It was a success.
That model has since served many industries well.

But manufacturing loans is not the same as manufacturing cars. Loans are neither
homogenous nor replicable. Making loans relies on bespoke, customer-specific
information. This information is not obtained by computer algorithm or credit rating
agency but through a banking relationship, ideally a long-term one. Despite the
advent of social networking, economies of scale are not something we typically
associate with long-term relationships.

So the economics of banking do not suggest that bigger need be better. Indeed, if
large-scale processing of loans risks economising on the collection of information,
there might even be diseconomies of scale in banking. The present crisis provides a
case study. The desire to make loans a tradable commodity led to a loss of
information, as transactions replaced relationships and quantity trumped quality.
Within the space of a decade, banks went from monogamy to speed-dating.

Evidence from a range of countries paints a revealing picture. There is not a scrap of
evidence of economies of scale or scope in banking – of bigger or broader being

10

better - beyond a low size threshold.12 At least during this crisis, big banks have if
anything been found to be less stable than their smaller counterparts, requiring on
average larger-scale support.13 It could be argued that big business needs big banks to
supply their needs. But this is not an argument that big businesses themselves
endorse, at least according to a recent survey by the Association of Corporate
Treasurers.14

Take Grameen Bank – not a household name in the UK, I realise. This grew out of a
micro-finance project in Bangladesh which began in 1976.15 Grameen operates as a
set of local credit cooperatives, often comprising as few as five members. The bank’s
relationship with its borrowers is bound not by legal contract but by trust. Like the
Yorkshire Penny Bank a century earlier, it aims to encourage saving by the poor and
supports the education of the children of borrowers and savers.

In some respects, Grameen Bank is about as basic and small-scale a set of banking
arrangements as it is possible to conceive. But its success is only too clear. From the
most modest of beginnings, Grameen Bank now operates in over 40 countries
worldwide, with over 2000 branches and over 7.5 million borrowers. Grameen is a
local bank gone global.

Henry Ford grew an empire on scale economies, centralisation and replication. For
the Ford Motor Company, bigger was better. At around the same time, Alfred P
Sloan of General Motors was following a different business model. Size still
mattered. But production was decentralised and specialised. The focus was on
customer needs supported by some of the first-ever market research on their tastes. In
the end, it was Sloan and General Motors whose strategy was emulated around the
world.

In meeting the future needs of the real economy, perhaps there is a case for more
“Sloans” and fewer “Fords” in banking. Perhaps there is a case for a strategic focus
on the ‘local’ as much as the ‘global’, for more micro-finance and less macro-finance.
Perhaps it is time for relationship-banking to make a comeback.

Strategy - diversity versus diversification

Customers require a basket of banking services. The provision of some of these
services is important for the wider economy; they are a quasi-public good. For
example, the provision of monetary services – basic banking – has a strong public
good element. That is why depositor protection, in the form of deposit insurance, is
stipulated by the state in many countries. Lending to households and companies can
also be thought to contain a public good element. Other functions performed by
banks may provide more limited social benefits, though their private benefit may be
significant – for example, proprietary trading in complex instruments.

If scale economies in banking are weak, banking services could probably be equally
well provided by either a financial supermarket or a set of specialist banks. These
different structures might not, however, be equivalent from a risk perspective. The
supermarket model potentially does offer some risk benefits - the benefits of
diversification. Profitable business lines can compensate for temporarily nonprofitable ones. What is lost on the swings may be regained on the roundabouts.

This is a story about which we have heard much over the past few months, especially
among the biggest global banks. In the first half of this year, big losses on the
banking book swings have been more than offset by big gains on the trading book
roundabouts. Diversification, we were told, was paying dividends – and, indeed,
bonuses.

But memories can be deceptively short. Rewind the clock one year. Then, it was
trading book losses that were eroding confidence in the banks. This in turn prompted
fears about some banks’ solvency, aggravating the very recession which is now

12

generating banking book losses. Trading book gains may well be acting as a hedge
today. But they are hedging a risk they helped create.

All of this implies that business line diversification can be a double-edged sword.
During the upswing, banks enjoyed windfall gains from bets at the race-track. This
boosted their buffers. But when those bets turned sour, these same activities put at
risk banks’ day job – the provision of loan and deposit services to the real economy.
9500 sub-prime mortgage products at the height of the boom might well have been
too many. But zero is surely too few.

There is a second important downside to diversification. While it might be sensible
for an individual firm to diversify its business lines to reduce its risk, if this same
strategy is followed by all banks the end-result may be greater fragility across the
whole system. Why? Because in their desire to look different than in the past, banks’
business strategies may end up looking identical in the present. The financial system
could then become more prone to herd-like upswings and lemming-like downswings.

There is more than a hint of this behaviour during the run-up to crisis. Banking
strategies became a whirligig. Building societies transformed themselves into
commercial banks. Commercial banks tried their hand at investment banking.
Investment banks developed in-house hedge funds through large proprietary trading
desks. Hedge funds competed with traditional investment funds. And to complete the
circle, these investment funds imported the risk all of the others were shedding. In
their desire to diversify, individual banks generated a lack of diversity, and thus
resilience, for the financial system as a whole.

So recent crisis experience highlights some of the costs of bundling banking services.
Given that, there is an intellectually defensible case for some unbundling of these
services. This would reduce the risks of spill-over between privately and socially
beneficial banking activities. And it would help prevent banks making individually
rational but collectively calamitous strategic choices.

There are plenty of examples from the non-financial world, from genetics to geology,
of diversity improving the robustness of systems. The financial system may be no
13

different. The resulting financial landscape would, however, look rather different.
There would be greater specialisation and diversity. The shopping experience for a
banking customer would be more farmers’ market than supermarket.
•

Governance - stakeholders versus shareholders

In deciding appropriate corporate governance arrangements, economists have tended
to focus on the relationship between shareholders (as principal) and managers (as
agent). Principal-agent problems arise when these two parties’ incentives are
misaligned. Profit-related pay is one means of achieving alignment, with managers
remunerated in line with shareholder returns. In addressing one incentive problem,
however, this approach may risk worsening two others – between shareholders and
depositors on the one hand and between shareholders and the public sector on the
other.

Limited liability means that returns to shareholders are capped below at zero, but not
above. That provides a natural incentive for owners to gamble, pursuing high
risk/high return strategies from which they import the return upside but export the risk
downside to depositors or the public sector. During this crisis, the pursuit of those
strategies has resulted in the public sector picking up the cheque for the downside in
an effort to reduce risks to depositors.

A mutual model of corporate governance gives rise to a rather different set of
incentives. Instead of external shareholders, savers and borrowers become the
owners, with profits remitted directly to them in the form of higher deposit rates
and/or lower borrowing rates. For that reason, measured profit margins appear
consistently lower for building societies than for banks.

Unlike in most industries, however, low margins for a mutual are very unlikely to
result in shareholder revolt or a missive to management to gear-up or get-out. They
are a reflection of corporate governance working for stakeholders, here defined
broadly to include depositors and borrowers. In this way, mutuality reduces the scope
for misaligned incentives between shareholders and depositors which might otherwise
arise in a joint stock bank.
14

This is not to suggest that mutuality is a panacea. For example, it does not address the
potential incentive problem between stakeholders and the public sector. Indeed, it
could even potentially worsen this problem as shareholders and depositors are one and
the same under mutuality and so must rank equally in the event of a payout from the
public purse. Moreover, profit margins in the building society sector are currently
under some pressure as a result of low Bank rate and increased competition for prime
residential loans. Some building societies have also hit bad loan problems.

Although painful in the short-term, these margin pressures ought in time to abate. So
in the heartland of mutuality, I am happy to say that reports of the death of the
building society sector are greatly exaggerated. Indeed, mutuality may do a better job
of aligning stakeholder incentives than some alternative forms of corporate
governance. It is a depressing but telling fact that, of the demutualised former UK
building societies, none is today in independent ownership.

Thrift, mutuality and relationship-building have long underpinned banking in
Yorkshire. These principles went missing in the run-up to the present crisis. The
costs of that vanishing act are now all too apparent. In rebuilding the financial
system, to create one which is both stable and better able to meet the needs of the real
economy, these principles need to be rediscovered. They offer a tried and tested –
indeed, trusted – roadmap for the period ahead.
