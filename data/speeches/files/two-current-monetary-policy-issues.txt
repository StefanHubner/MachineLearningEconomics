Summary
Two Current Monetary Policy Issues
Two issues are considered, first the impending switch to targeting the HICP inflation
rate and second the implications of the steady rise in household debt. The following
is a summary of the discussion, starting with the switch to HICP targeting.
1. In the longer run, thanks to differences in computational methods and the absence
of the housing depreciation and council tax elements, the HICP inflation rate is
likely, on average, to be around 0.8 pp lower than the RPI(X) inflation rate. In the
short run, the gap between the two rates is highly volatile.
2. The long-run stance of monetary policy should be gauged by the real interest rate.
Since the switch from an RPIX target to an HICP target should have no long-run
real impact on the economy, the long-run stance of monetary policy will be
unaffected.
3. If the HICP target is set at 2.0%, this is equivalent, in the long run, to a switch
from an RPIX target of 2.5% to an RPIX target of 2.8%, because the long-run gap
is 0.8 pp. Since the long-run real interest rate is unaffected by the switch, the
long-run nominal interest rate will be 0.3 pp higher after the switch.
4. If the HICP target is set at 2.0%, this is equivalent to a rise of 0.3 pp in the longer
term inflation rate (ie. a switch from an RPIX target of 2.5% to an RPIX target of
2.8% or a switch from an HICP target of 1.7% to an HICP target of 2%, making
use of the 0.8 pp long run gap between HICP and RPIX). This will involve
slightly looser monetary policy for a limited period than would otherwise be the
case. However, given the volatility in the gap between HICP and RPIX inflation
and the frequent shocks to which the economy is subject, the temporary loosening
would be barely noticeable in practice.
5. A switch to an HICP target of 2% today would have little or no impact on the
current stance of monetary policy despite the large gap between RPIX and HICP
inflation at present. This is because this large gap is only temporary, having been
generated by the recent surge in house price inflation which impacts on RPIX, via
the housing depreciation element, but not on HICP. As this surge fades, the gap
will close to normal levels and given the structure of the August RPIX inflation
projection, the corresponding HICP projection would not be far from 2% towards
the end of the forecast horizon.
6. The direct inclusion of house prices in RPIX, via the housing depreciation
element, only impacted on monetary policy to the extent that the MPC was able to
forecast surges in house price inflation well in advance. History indicates that it
was not able to do this. So excluding this element from the cost of living index
will probably have little consequence for monetary policy in practice. (Of course
house price booms will continue to impact on monetary policy via their impact on

2

debt, consumption and aggregate demand further out. This is equally true whether
we have an RPIX or an HICP target.)
Turning next to the issue of household debt, we consider both the causes and
consequences of its dramatic increase.
7. Household secured debt (mortgages) is around 80 per cent of total household debt
and is thus more significant than unsecured debt in the macroeconomic context.
The secured debt to income ratio rose rapidly throughout the 1980s and from the
middle of the 1990s, so it is now more than double its level in 1980. The most
important factor underlying this change has been the trend increase in the number
of owner-occupied dwellings per person of working age. This trend has been
generated by the shrinking average size of households and the increasing owneroccupation rate (strongly boosted by Council House sales). Other factors include
the somewhat higher loan-to-income ratios offered to first-time buyers in the
period of low inflation since 1992, as mortgages are no longer heavily “front end
loaded”, and the short-term burst of mortgage equity withdrawal following the
recent housing boom as homeowners have greater access to the lower real interest
rate borrowing available on secured debt.
8. Household unsecured debt has also risen rapidly relative to income in recent
years. By and large, this has reflected increasing debt levels per unsecured debtor,
not rising numbers of unsecured debtors. A key factor explaining this is likely to
have been the rapid trend fall in unsecured borrowing rates since the late 1990s, a
vastly greater fall than in the Bank of England repo rate, probably due to
increasing competition in the unsecured lending market.
9. The connection between household borrowing and consumption is a tenuous one.
The proportion of nominal GDP spent on household consumption was almost the
same in 2003 Q1 (63.2%) as in 1996 Q4 (62.7%) despite the vastly greater rate of
new household borrowing in the more recent period. What has happened is that
the rapid increase in new borrowing in recent years has been almost exactly
balanced by a rapid increase in net purchases of financial assets, a fact which is
rarely mentioned when household debt is discussed.
10. Looking at household balance sheets, we find that today the ratio of total
household debt to total household assets (financial assets plus housing wealth) is
just below 17%, very close to its average value over the last fifteen years.
Furthermore, despite the recent burst of mortgage equity withdrawal, undrawn
housing equity is rising and is now in excess of three quarters of total housing
wealth. So overall, household balance sheets are relatively healthy.
11. Despite the health of average household balance sheets, there are many
households, particularly with low incomes, which are in severe difficulties with
unsecured debt. The evidence on whether this situation is getting worse is mixed,
but, in any event, unsecured debt is such a small proportion of the total that the
macroeconomic impact of such problems is not large.
12. While the published secured debt to income ratio has been rising rapidly since
1997, this is not a very helpful piece of information when it comes to analysing
issues of sustainability. The problem is that the numerator of the ratio refers to the

3

sum total of mortgage debt whereas the denominator refers to the total disposable
income of all households. To be informative, the denominator should be the total
disposable income of households with mortgages. Up-to-date data using this
measure is unavailable but we know that the ratio of total secured debt to total
income of secured debt holders exhibited no upward trend from 1997 to 2001.
13. Despite the above, could record levels of household debt cause serious
macroeconomic problems in the future? There are three frequently used
arguments. The first is based on the possibility that households have
underestimated true real interest rates. In the high inflation era prior to 1993,
debts were rapidly eroded. This no longer happens and perhaps households do not
fully recognise this fact. However, the young, who tend to be the most indebted
(relative to their income and assets) and hence the most endangered, were not
financially aware in the pre-1993 era, so there is little reason to think they are not
making sensible judgments on this score. Indeed, overall, there are no strong
reasons why households, or indeed lenders, should be behaving particularly
imprudently. Nor is there any persuasive evidence that they are doing so.
14. The second argument is that the economy will be a more fragile place in the future
if households have very high levels of debt. In particular, in response to a future
adverse shock, higher debt levels would lead to bigger falls in consumption and a
bigger economic slowdown. However, since debt service charges are the problem
here, in a higher debt world adverse shocks could be offset by a more vigorous
monetary policy response.
15. The third argument is very simple. If more people have big mortgages, a collapse
in the housing market has more serious macroeconomic consequences. Of course,
if this were thought to be a serious issue, one solution is a policy to reduce the size
of the owner-occupied sector. More council houses, perhaps. But, in the present
situation, does this mean we should use policy to discourage people from taking
out mortgages? In my view, this should not be the target of monetary policy.
16. This leads to the final question, should we keep interest rates higher than would be
required to hit the inflation target in the medium term in order not to encourage
further debt accumulation? In the light of all the previous points, my answer, at
present, would be no.

1. Introduction
In recent months, two issues associated with UK monetary policy have given rise to
much debate. These are the impending switch to targeting the inflation rate of the
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the continuing anxiety associated
with the inexorable rise in household debt.
In what follows, consideration is given to both of these topics. Concerning the switch
to HICP, we look at the difference between the HICP and the RPIX measures of
inflation and then discuss the changes which would occur in the economy generally
were HICP to become the standard measure of the cost of living. We follow this by
looking at the consequences for monetary policy. We note that in the long-run, the
stance of monetary policy would be unaffected and even in the short run there would
be little noticeable difference. Finally, we consider the particular consequences
arising from the absence of any housing depreciation element in the HICP index.
Turning to the ever rising levels of household debt, we first consider why it is
increasing so fast. In this context we distinguish between secured debt (mortgages)
which is the bulk of total debt (around 80%) and unsecured debt (credit cards,
overdrafts etc). We find that the long-term increase in secured debt is driven
fundamentally by the rising number of households and the increasing proportion of
these which are owner-occupiers. Unsecured debt, on the other hand, has risen not
because of a rapid rise in the number of unsecured debtors but because of a continuing
increase in the levels of unsecured debt for each debtor, perhaps encouraged by the
rapid trend decline in interest rates on unsecured debt over the last five years.
Next we look at the relationship between rising debt and consumption, noting that in
recent years rising borrowing has, in fact, corresponded to rising rates of
accumulation of financial assets. The overall balance sheet position of households
has not been worsening rapidly. Finally, we discuss whether high levels of debt will
cause problems in the future. While there is some uncertainty here, our overall
conclusion is probably not.

2. The Switch to HICP
The Chancellor has announced that, at some point, the MPC will switch to an inflation
target using the HICP measure. Before looking closely at the implications of all this
for monetary policy, it is important to understand what it means for everyday
economic life.
What is the Difference between HICP and RPIX Inflation?
The main differences between the HICP and RPIX measures of inflation are as
follows.
i)

In the HICP, the geometric mean is used to aggregate price changes at the
most basic level whereas the RPIX uses the arithmetic mean.

Since the geometric mean of a group of different numbers is always less than the
arithmetic mean of the same group of numbers1, this difference in the construction of
the two measures will always tend to make HICP inflation lower than RPIX inflation.
This is the formula effect and, on average, makes HICP inflation 0.5 percentage
points per annum lower than RPIX inflation.
ii)

HICP excludes housing depreciation, council tax and dwellings insurance.
RPIX includes these.

The housing depreciation element and council taxes have tended to rise faster than the
other elements of RPIX, on average. Their exclusion will therefore tend, in the long
run, to lower measured inflation assuming that house prices track earnings over the
long term and council tax rates continue to rise faster than 2.5% pa. The long-run
impact of this housing effect is likely to make HICP inflation around 0.3 percentage
points per annum lower than RPIX inflation2.
iii)

HICP includes university accommodation fees, foreign students tuition fees,
stockbrokers charges. RPIX excludes these. Also there are numerous other
minor differences. (The National Statistics web-site contains all the details.)

On average, these differences between HICP and RPIX contribute nothing to long-run
average inflation rate differentials between the two measures.

6

The differences under points (i) and (ii), when combined, suggest a long-run average
differential between HICP and RPIX inflation of 0.8 percentage points per annum. In
the shorter term, there is a great deal of variation in the differential as we can see from
Figure 1. While the formula effect is relatively stable, the housing and other elements
of the differential are highly volatile. Currently, the differential is very large because
the housing depreciation element, depending as it does on recent rates of house price
inflation, is making such a large contribution to RPIX inflation3. But even the longrun average differential of 0.8 is large. So the proposed switch to the HICP measure
of inflation will mean that measured inflation will be considerably lower, on average,
than it would have been had we stuck to RPIX. So what difference will this make?
The Changes in the Economy Following a Switch to HICP
Suppose, for the sake of argument, that HICP gradually takes over from RPI(X) as the
index used in economic life. Under HICP, on average, the measured cost of living
goes up by 0.8 percentage points per annum less than under RPI(X). This change
makes no difference whatever to the rate of increase of the true cost of living, of
which HICP and RPI(X) are different measures.
So one important implication of the switch to HICP is that for given nominal wage
growth, real wage growth will be measured to be 0.8 percentage points per annum
higher after the switch. True real wage growth will, however, be unchanged. If
people understand this, they will understand that the measured increase in real wage
growth of 0.8 percentage points per annum, after the switch, is a mirage. So, for
example, if negotiations for pay increases are currently based on long-run RPIX
inflation plus x% (for productivity growth etc.), then after the switch they will have to
be based on long-run HICP inflation plus 0.8 plus x%, if they are to be unaffected by
the switch. The thing to remember is that the RPIX inflation rate and the HICP
inflation rate plus 0.8 represent the same rate of cost of living increase over the long
term.
Suppose that this does not happen. For example, suppose instead that after the switch,
unions and firms negotiate on the basis of long-run HICP inflation plus x%, where x is
the same productivity etc. effect as above. Then nominal wage growth and true real

7

wage growth will tend to be lower and this will tend to exert downward pressure on
inflation in the long run (on either measure).
Exactly as with real wage growth, the switch has the same implications for measured
real interest rates.

For given nominal interest rates, after the switch to HICP,

measured (ex post) real interest rates will be, on average, 0.8 percentage points
higher.

However, the true real interest rate will be unaffected.

Agents in the

economy will need to get used to the fact that measured real interest rates will be
higher by roughly 0.8 percentage points, ceteris paribus. So what are the implications
of all this for monetary policy?
The Implications of the Switch to HICP for Monetary Policy
The most important point to recognise is that the long-run stance of monetary policy
should not be gauged by the nominal interest rate but by the real interest rate. And the
switch from an RPIX target to an HICP target, whatever the level of either target,
should have no long-run real impact on the economy, including on the real interest
rate. So the long-run stance of monetary policy will be unaffected. So we have,
Implication 1. The long-run stance of monetary policy will be unaffected by the
switch to an HICP target.
In order to go further, we have to make some assumption about the new target. For
the purposes of this exposition, suppose that the HICP inflation target is 2%. This is
equivalent to a long-run RPIX target of 2.8%, so it represents a genuine change to the
inflation target facing the MPC. As we have already noted, the long-run stance of
monetary policy and the true long-run real interest rate are unaffected. Since, when
measured in terms of RPIX inflation, the real interest rate will switch from (r-2.5) to
(r-2.8), where r is the nominal rate, it is obvious that to keep the real rate unchanged,
the long-run nominal rate must be 0.3 percentage points higher4. This leads to,
Implication 2. If the HICP target is set at 2.0%, this is equivalent, in the long run, to
a switch from an RPIX target of 2.5% to an RPIX target of 2.8%. Since the long-run
real interest rate is unaffected by the switch (see Implication1), the long-run nominal
interest rate will be 0.3 percentage points higher after the switch.

8

What about the consequences for monetary policy in the short run? Since the switch
involves a de facto rise in the inflation target from 2.5 to 2.8 in RPIX terms or from
1.7 to 2.0 in HICP terms, it is the job of the MPC to ensure that long-term inflation is
0.3 percentage points higher than it otherwise would have been.

This involves

slightly looser monetary policy than would otherwise have been the case, for a limited
period, in order to generate the small rise in the longer-term inflation rate. However,
it would be a mistake to make too much of this. Given the large variations in the gap
between HICP inflation and RPIX inflation (see Figure 1) and the frequent shocks to
which the economy is subject, such a slight loosening of monetary policy (relative to
the counterfactual of no switch in target) would be small relative to its normal
variation. So we have,
Implication 3. If the HICP target is set at 2.0%, this implies that the short-term
monetary policy stance has to be such as to raise the longer-term inflation rate by 0.3
percentage points. This involves slightly looser monetary policy for a limited period
than would otherwise be the case. However, given the large variations in the gap
between HICP and RPIX inflation and the frequent shocks to which the economy is
subject, this temporary loosening would be barely noticeable in practice.
So far, it appears that if there were a switch to HICP with a target of 2%, this would
not make much odds. Until now, however, we have only looked at the implications of
the switch when the RPIX/HICP differential is at its long-run average level of 0.8 pp.
But today it is at around twice its long run level at 1.6 pp. What, then, would be the
consequences of the switch taking place when the gap is at a very high level? The
key point is that monetary policy decisions are based not on where inflation is today
but on where inflation is expected to be a year or two hence. Looking at the RPIX
inflation projection for August 2003, (see Figure 2), the large “bump” which may be
observed stretching from the last part of 2002 to the end of 2003 is generated, in the
main, by the impact of the house price boom on RPIX inflation via the housing
depreciation component.

The path of HICP inflation would not exhibit such a

"bump” and that is the main reason why the current gap is so wide as we have already
noted. But as the housing boom fades in our forecast, the bump disappears and the
RPIX/HICP gap narrows.

Indeed, because the rate of house price inflation is

projected to fall below the average rate of earnings growth, the gap may well fall
below its average level of 0.8 pp. Because of this, the level of HICP inflation

9

corresponding to the RPIX projection in 2005 is not going to be very different from
2%. This implies that monetary policy decisions taken today were we using an HICP
target of 2% would probably be much the same as those we are actually taking. This
leads to,
Implication 4. A switch to an HICP target of 2% today should have little or no
impact on the current stance of monetary policy despite the large gap between RPIX
and HICP inflation. This is because this large gap is only temporary, generated by
the recent surge in house price inflation which impacts on RPIX via the housing
depreciation element but not on HICP. As this surge fades away, the gap will close to
more normal levels and given the structure of the August RPIX projection, the
corresponding HICP projection would not be very different from 2% towards the end
of the forecast horizon.
Two further implications of a switch to an HICP target are worth commenting on.
First, suppose wage setters do not follow the rules set out earlier in this section. For
example, suppose they base negotiations on long-run HICP inflation plus x. This will
tend to lead to lower nominal wage growth than we have now, lower real income
growth and ultimately downward pressure on inflation. This would then impact on
monetary policy.
The second, and perhaps more interesting, implication of the switch to an HICP target
arises from the fact that the housing depreciation element is excluded from the HICP.
We have already noted the history of this element (see Footnote 2), so what would be
the implications of its absence? The housing depreciation element in RPIX has a
weight of around 4.4% and is based on a distributed lag of the ODPM measure of
house prices. What this means is that a significant surge in house price inflation, such
as we saw in 2002, leads to a subsequent surge in RPIX inflation, such as we saw
from mid-2002. No such surge would be seen in HICP inflation. At first sight, it
might be thought that this would have a significant impact on monetary policy. In
practice, however, this would only be true if the MPC were capable of forecasting the
surge in house prices well in advance, for recall that monetary policy tends to be
influenced not by current inflation but movements in inflation which are forecast
some one to two years ahead.

10

Looking at recent history as evidenced by the recent Inflation Report projections
presented in Figure 2, the MPC completely failed to forecast the house price surge of
2002 either two years or even one year before it happened (as, incidentally, did
everyone else). The house price surge generates the “bump” in the RPIX inflation
projection in 2002/03 faintly visible in Figure 2 only from May 2002 and clearly
visible from November 2002 onwards. Consequently, by the time the surge in RPIX
inflation generated by the house price explosion was expected to come about, it was
too late to do anything about its implications for inflation. Thus, in November 2002,
the MPC expected the surge would disappear within a year and, since monetary policy
typically takes 18 months to two years to impact fully on inflation, the house price
surge had little impact on policy via its direct impact on the depreciation element of
RPIX. Of course, the house price explosion impacted strongly on monetary policy
because of its impact on debt, consumption and aggregate demand further out. But
this would have been the case even had HICP inflation been targeted. The argument
here is that the direct inclusion of house prices in the RPIX via the housing
depreciation element only impacts on monetary policy if the MPC can forecast surges
in house price inflation well in advance. Recent history indicates this is unlikely. So
excluding this element from the cost of living index will probably have little
consequence for monetary policy in practice.
2. Household Debt: Causes and Consequences
In recent months, there has been much discussion of the inexorable rise in household
debt with many dire warnings. In a relatively mild example, Philip Thornton in The
Independent (30 July, 2003) notes that,
“Britons piled on an all-time record amount of debt last month (June 2003),
triggering fears that consumers have embarked on an unsustainable borrowing binge
that will end in a crash reminiscent of the early 1990s”.
Here we look more closely at the rise in household debt, first to try and understand
why it has happened and second to look at the dangers inherent in the current position.
Why is Household Debt Rising so Rapidly?
In order to analyse household debt, it is important to distinguish between secured debt
(mortgages secured on property) and unsecured debt (credit card debt, overdrafts,

11

personal loans, hire purchase, student loans, DSS social fund loans, and others).
Around four-fifths of all household debt is secured on dwellings and so, in the
macroeconomic context, the level of secured debt is more significant. However, in
terms of personal and social problems, unsecured debt is a very important issue. Let
us consider each in turn.
Unsecured debt. As we can see from Figure 3, unsecured debt has been rising
steadily as a proportion of total post-tax household income since the mid-1990s. By
and large, this reflects increasing debt levels per unsecured debtor, not rising numbers
of unsecured debtors5. Part of this rise may be due to the increasing ease with which
unsecured credit may be obtained, but a key factor is likely to have been the dramatic
trend fall in unsecured borrowing rates in recent years (see Figure 4). Given the
stability of inflation during this period, this represents a significant fall in real rates.
Much of this decline is unrelated to monetary policy changes, with unsecured rates
falling by far more than the repo rate in the last few years. This may have been the
consequence of increasing competition in the unsecured lending market.
Secured debt. As we can see in Figure 5, the household secured debt to disposable
income ratio was flat in the 1970s, then rose rapidly throughout the 1980s and started
rising again in the later 1990s. So what are the driving forces behind this long-term
increase. Probably the most important factor has been the trend increase in the
number of owner-occupied dwellings per person of working age (see Figure 6). This
is partly due to the rise in the total number of occupied dwellings, reflecting smaller
households, and partly to the increasing owner occupation rate, broadly offsetting the
decline in the local authority renting sector due to council house sales. So from 1970,
the number of owner occupied dwellings per person of working age has increased by
around 75 per cent. Each new owner occupied dwelling is a potential new mortgage,
so, over the longer term, we would expect the secured debt to income ratio to rise in
the same proportion. This is because of the way the secured debt to income ratio is
measured. The numerator refers to the sum of the secured debts of all the households
with secured debt and the denominator is the sum of the disposable incomes of all
households, not just those with secured debt.

12

Interestingly, despite the fact that the number of owner occupied dwellings was rising
steadily from 1970, the debt to income ratio did not start rising until 1980. This was
because the very high rates of inflation in the 1970s were eroding real debt very
rapidly. Thus the debt to income ratios of individual mortgage holders were declining
fast enough to offset the increase in their numbers, so the aggregate debt to income
ratio remained flat. When overall inflation rates declined in the 1980s, the increase in
the number of mortgage holders began to dominate, so the aggregate secured debt to
income ratio started to rise. And, apart from a break in the early 1990s, it has been
doing so ever since. Furthermore, given that the demographic trends in Figure 6 may
be expected to continue, the rise in the secured debt to income ratio may also be
expected to continue. Indeed, even if the number of owner-occupied dwellings per
person of working age suddenly stopped increasing, because of the lags built into the
process we would expect the secured debt to income ratio to continue to rise to new
record levels for some years to come (see Hamilton, 2003 for a full analysis of all
these issues).
While these demographic factors are the key to understanding long-term trends in the
secured debt to income ratio, they are not the only ones. In a world of low inflation,
nominal interest rates are low. This means that mortgage interest and repayments are
no longer heavily “front end loaded” and so even with unchanged real interest rates,
lenders and borrowers are happy with higher initial debt to income ratios when
starting new mortgages6. So since the 1970s, we have seen a significant rise in the
income multiples allowed by mortgage lenders and a consequent rise in the average
loan to income ratios of first-time buyers. This has been reinforced by the rise over
the same period in the proportion of two-earner households. A second factor, which
is important in determining short-run fluctuations in the secured debt to income ratio,
is mortgage equity withdrawal. This always tends to rise when there is a surge in
house prices such as we have recently experienced, because, for some households,
such a surge opens up the option of further borrowing at the secured real interest rate
which still tends to be 6 percentage points or more below the unsecured rate. This
response to a lower effective real rate is entirely consistent with prudent behaviour
and does not, of itself, reflect irresponsibility on the part of either borrowers or
lenders. So having set out the forces underlying increases in household debt, we must
now look at the dangers inherent in the current situation.

13

Consumer Borrowing, Debt and Consumption
The general impression given by much of the discussion on household borrowing is
that rapidly rising debt to income ratios are inextricably linked to high rates of
household consumption growth. This is obviously wrong because households may
simply spend their borrowings on assets, not on consumption. Indeed, even when
they appear (in the data) to be spending their borrowings on consumption, they may in
fact be spending them on assets if, for example, their “consumption” consists of
buying new kitchen units. In the light of this, it is also obvious that we could observe
high levels of borrowing even when consumption growth is very depressed. So let us
look at what has been happening in recent years. Since 1997 Q4, real household
consumption growth has averaged 4.1% per annum whereas the real growth of GDP
has been 2.6% per annum. So consumption has been growing much faster than GDP
over this period. This suggests that the build-up of household debt over the same
period has been spent on consumption. Yet amazingly enough, the proportion of
nominal GDP spent on household consumption was 62.7% in 1996 Q4 and 63.2% in
2003 Q1, almost exactly the same! This despite the fact that consumption has been
growing much faster than GDP throughout the period. So how can this be?
The trick is in the prices. The price of consumption goods and services has been
rising more slowly than the price of GDP over this period. Now GDP can be thought
of as the net output of goods and services produced by the UK economy whereas
consumption is what UK households consume. Some of the output produced by the
UK economy is exported and some of the output consumed by UK households is
imported. And it so happens that throughout this period goods imported by the UK
have become increasingly cheaper relative to goods exported. This continuing
improvement in the terms of trade since the mid-1990s (see Figure 7) has therefore
been of continuing benefit to UK households and explains why the price of
consumption goods has grown more slowly than the price of GDP. This, in its turn,
explains how real consumption growth can be much higher than real GDP growth for
many years with barely any change in the proportion of nominal GDP being spent on
household consumption.

14

So where does the rise in household debt come into this story? In Figure 8, we see
that, by and large, the increased borrowing corresponds closely to the acquisition of
financial assets7. In Table 1, we see precisely what these assets are. Basically they
include cash and deposits as well as savings vehicles of various kinds (mainly pension
funds and life insurance). Equity flows have generally been negative. So over recent
years, the rapid increase in loans has been almost exactly balanced by a rapid increase
in the purchase of financial assets, a fact which is rarely mentioned when household
debt is discussed8. Of course, the people purchasing the assets may not be the same
people as those accumulating the liabilities. So will it all end in tears?
Is Household Debt Too High?
To answer this question, the best place to start is the overall household balance sheet
position. This is summarised in Figure 9. What we observe is that the ratio of total
household debt to total household assets (financial assets plus housing wealth) is just
below 17 per cent and is very close to its average value over the last fifteen years. So
while this ratio has risen over the last few years, mainly because of the fall in the
stock market since 2000, it is hardly at dangerous levels. Similarly, looking at the
ratio of unsecured debt to financial wealth, we see that while the number is higher
than the fifteen-year average, it is not very high by historical standards.
So while there appears to be nothing very dangerous in these overall numbers, have
the high rates of mortgage equity withdrawal produced excessive secured debt levels
relative to housing wealth? In fact, as Figure 10 makes clear, mortgage equity
withdrawal has not kept up with rising house prices, so that undrawn housing equity is
now in excess of three quarters of total housing wealth. And finally, the cost of
servicing all this household debt, even if we include regular repayments of mortgage
principal, is currently at an historically low level relative to household income (see
Figure 11). Of course, this is due to very low interest rates. But these would have to
rise to around 10 per cent to push household income gearing up to its average level in
the early 1990s.
So the overall average picture remains benign despite the rapid accumulation of debt.
And it will remain benign even if further debt is accumulated, as we expect it to be for
the reasons already discussed. But the aggregate picture may be misleading. Maybe

15

those with high debts are not the same households as those with high assets. In fact,
broadly speaking, this is not true. Almost inevitably, those with high debts tend to
have big mortgages and those with big mortgages tend to have expensive properties.
But this does not mean that debt does not cause serious problems to many households.
There are many low-income households in severe difficulty with unsecured debt. The
evidence on whether there has been an increase in these difficulties is mixed (see Cox
et al. 2002 and the Financial Stability Review, 2003, Section 2.3). But whether or not
the situation is getting worse, unsecured debt problems there are, and these are bad for
the individuals concerned and form an important issue for social policy.
Nevertheless, because the volume of unsecured debt is relatively small, this is
unlikely to be a particularly significant macroeconomic issue, so this leaves us with
the question of secured debt.
More on the secured debt picture
Any case being made for the dangers of household debt usually starts from the rising
debt to income ratio. And it is clear from Figure 5 that the secured debt to income
ratio is higher than it has ever been and, as we have seen, it is expected to go still
higher. But, as a measure of danger, or sustainability, the debt to income ratio is
almost worthless since the debt refers to the sum of the debts of debtors and the
income refers to the income of everybody. What we need in this context is the total
debt of secured debt holders (or mortgage holders) normalised on the total income of
secured debt holders. Unfortunately, it is hard to get up-to-date numbers but as we
can see from Table 2, there has been no upward trend in this ratio from the mid-1990s
to 2001. This was a period when the aggregate secured debt to income ratio rose by
around 8 percentage points. This, of course, simply reflects the fact that much of the
overall increase in debt arises from the increasing number of people with mortgages
because more and more people own their own home. It is also consistent with the fact
that in 2001 only 5 per cent of mortgage holders reported any form of distress, well
down on the levels in the early 1990s. Of course, since 2001, it is possible that
mortgage holders have seen a significant increase in debt relative to their income and
that an increased proportion of them have been imprudent. We don’t know. But such
evidence as we have, for example, historically low levels of arrears, suggests that
there is no sign that mortgage holders, who hold the vast bulk of household debt, are
facing increasing problems – indeed, lenders typically argue the reverse. More

16

sophisticated credit scoring has generated a reduction in problems. One thing we do
know, however, is that the mere existence of more mortgage debt in total does not
necessarily mean any increase in danger to the macroeconomy. And given the
historically low levels of mortgage arrears, evidence of such an increase in danger is
hard to find.
Will High Levels of Debt Cause Problems in the Future?
As we have seen, total household debt is at a record level and is highly likely to reach
even higher levels over the coming years. Despite this, household balance sheets are
not seriously stretched. Nevertheless, could these record levels of debt cause serious
macroeconomic problems in the future?
There are three distinct arguments here. The first is based on the possibility that
households have underestimated the true real interest rate which they face. So it is
sometimes argued that debtors will collectively “wake-up” to the fact that their debts
have not been eroded, and will then take fright and cut their consumption dramatically
causing severe macroeconomic problems. In the light of our previous discussion, why
households, particularly mortgage holders who have the bulk of the debt, should do
this is not at all clear. It is true that in the era of high inflation, which ended in 1992,
debts were rapidly eroded. But the mortgage holders with the highest debts relative to
income, namely the young, have no adult experience of the high inflation era.
Furthermore, they are the group with the fastest real earnings growth. So while they
might behave in the irrational fashion described above, there seems no obvious reason
why they should.
The second argument concerns the behaviour of the economy in response to shocks if
households have high, as opposed to low, levels of debt. Suppose there is a future
adverse shock to the UK economy – for example, the major European economies do
not recover. This will lead to a rise in UK unemployment and a fall in consumption
whatever the debt levels. The argument here is that higher debt levels will make
things substantially worse. That is because more people will be in a position where
they are unable to extend their borrowing. If they become unemployed, or are
threatened with unemployment, they will significantly reduce consumption because
they will be, or will have the prospect of being, unable to service their debts.

17

The first question is, will higher debt levels put substantially more people in this
position? In aggregate, there appears to be “plenty of room”. As we have seen,
secured debt is only around one quarter of gross housing wealth, a substantially lower
level than throughout the 1990s (see Figure 10). But the aggregate hides a wide
variation across the population and it is the numbers on the margin which count.
Comfort may perhaps be taken from the fact that data from the Survey of Mortgage
Lenders indicate that loan to value ratios on new mortgages are modest by historical
standards and are falling (see Financial Stability Review, June 2003, Chart 119).
Furthermore, there has been a significant demographic shift towards two earner
households over the last two decades and these households have a greater cushion
against unemployment.
Another point worth noting is that because one of the key issues in this argument is
the cost of debt service, this will be moderated by the easing of monetary policy
following the adverse shock. Back in the early 1990s, of course, this option was
unavailable because of the ERM constraint. However, the excessive debt may still
induce greater precautionary saving and a larger drop in consumption. Overall, it is
hard to tell whether higher debt levels will generate a significant additional cut back
in consumption which cannot be modified by easier monetary policy.
The third argument is very simple. More people with mortgages means more trouble
if there is a really serious collapse in the housing market. If house prices fall by 30 or
40 per cent, more people with mortgages means more people in negative equity. Of
course, the consequences of this depend to some extent on the behaviour of lenders.
If the mortgage debt continues to be treated as secured, even though some is not, then
debt service costs remain unchanged. So a lot will then depend on the collateral
damage associated with the collapse in the housing market and what caused it in the
first place. For example, the house price correction in the late 1980s and early 1990s
was basically a consequence of the 15 per cent interest rates required to control
inflation. The tight monetary policy also generated a big rise in unemployment and
all this together had a big macroeconomic impact. This particular scenario seems
unlikely today. But what causes the collapse in house prices is not the main question.
The issue is, if some disaster happens in the housing market, does the fact that more

18

people have mortgages make the consequences very much worse? So much worse,
indeed, that monetary policy should be used today to discourage individuals from
taking out mortgages. In my view, this should not be a target of monetary policy.
This leads to the final question, namely, should we keep interest rates higher than
would be required to hit the inflation target in the medium term in order not to
encourage further debt accumulation, because this will add to the risk of sharper falls
in consumption generating an even bigger undershoot of the inflation target further
out? In the light of all the previous discussion, my judgment, at present, would be no.
4. Summary and Conclusions
We have looked at two issues, first the impending switch to targeting the HICP
inflation rate and second the implications of the steady rise in household debt. The
following is a summary of the discussion, starting with the switch to HICP targeting.
1. In the longer run, thanks to differences in computational methods and the absence
of the housing depreciation and council tax elements, the HICP inflation rate is
likely, on average, to be around 0.8 pp lower than the RPI(X) inflation rate. In the
short run, the gap between the two rates is highly volatile.
2. The long-run stance of monetary policy should be gauged by the real interest rate.
Since the switch from an RPIX target to an HICP target should have no long-run
real impact on the economy, the long-run stance of monetary policy will be
unaffected.
3. If the HICP target is set at 2.0%, this is equivalent, in the long run, to a switch
from an RPIX target of 2.5% to an RPIX target of 2.8%, because the long-run gap
is 0.8 pp. Since the long-run real interest rate is unaffected by the switch, the
long-run nominal interest rate will be 0.3 pp higher after the switch.
4. If the HICP target is set at 2.0%, this is equivalent to a rise of 0.3 pp in the longer
term inflation rate (ie. a switch from an RPIX target of 2.5% to an RPIX target of
2.8% or a switch from an HICP target of 1.7% to an HICP target of 2%, making
use of the 0.8 pp long run gap between HICP and RPIX). This will involve
slightly looser monetary policy for a limited period than would otherwise be the
case. However, given the volatility in the gap between HICP and RPIX inflation
and the frequent shocks to which the economy is subject, the temporary loosening
would be barely noticeable in practice.
5. A switch to an HICP target of 2% today would have little or no impact on the
current stance of monetary policy despite the large gap between RPIX and HICP
inflation at present. This is because this large gap is only temporary, having been
generated by the recent surge in house price inflation which impacts on RPIX, via

19

the housing depreciation element, but not on HICP. As this surge fades, the gap
will close to normal levels and given the structure of the August RPIX inflation
projection, the corresponding HICP projection would not be far from 2% towards
the end of the forecast horizon.
6. The direct inclusion of house prices in RPIX, via the housing depreciation
element, only impacted on monetary policy to the extent that the MPC was able to
forecast surges in house price inflation well in advance. History indicates that it
was not able to do this. So excluding this element from the cost of living index
will probably have little consequence for monetary policy in practice. (Of course
house price booms will continue to impact on monetary policy via their impact on
debt, consumption and aggregate demand further out. This is equally true whether
we have an RPIX or an HICP target.)
Turning next to the issue of household debt, we consider both the causes and
consequences of its dramatic increase.
7. Household secured debt (mortgages) is around 80 per cent of total household debt
and is thus more significant than unsecured debt in the macroeconomic context.
The secured debt to income ratio rose rapidly throughout the 1980s and from the
middle of the 1990s, so it is now more than double its level in 1980. The most
important factor underlying this change has been the trend increase in the number
of owner-occupied dwellings per person of working age. This trend has been
generated by the shrinking average size of households and the increasing owneroccupation rate (strongly boosted by Council House sales). Other factors include
the somewhat higher loan-to-income ratios offered to first-time buyers in the
period of low inflation since 1992, as mortgages are no longer heavily “front end
loaded”, and the short-term burst of mortgage equity withdrawal following the
recent housing boom as homeowners have greater access to the lower real interest
rate borrowing available on secured debt.
8. Household unsecured debt has also risen rapidly relative to income in recent
years. By and large, this has reflected increasing debt levels per unsecured debtor,
not rising numbers of unsecured debtors. A key factor explaining this is likely to
have been the rapid trend fall in unsecured borrowing rates since the late 1990s, a
vastly greater fall than in the Bank of England repo rate, probably due to
increasing competition in the unsecured lending market.
9. The connection between household borrowing and consumption is a tenuous one.
The proportion of nominal GDP spent on household consumption was almost the
same in 2003 Q1 (63.2%) as in 1996 Q4 (62.7%) despite the vastly greater rate of
new household borrowing in the more recent period. What has happened is that
the rapid increase in new borrowing in recent years has been almost exactly
balanced by a rapid increase in net purchases of financial assets, a fact which is
rarely mentioned when household debt is discussed.
10. Looking at household balance sheets, we find that today the ratio of total
household debt to total household assets (financial assets plus housing wealth) is
just below 17%, very close to its average value over the last fifteen years.
Furthermore, despite the recent burst of mortgage equity withdrawal, undrawn

20

housing equity is rising and is now in excess of three quarters of total housing
wealth. So overall, household balance sheets are relatively healthy.
11. Despite the health of average household balance sheets, there are many
households, particularly with low incomes, which are in severe difficulties with
unsecured debt. The evidence on whether this situation is getting worse is mixed,
but, in any event, unsecured debt is such a small proportion of the total that the
macroeconomic impact of such problems is not large.
12. While the published secured debt to income ratio has been rising rapidly since
1997, this is not a very helpful piece of information when it comes to analysing
issues of sustainability. The problem is that the numerator of the ratio refers to the
sum total of mortgage debt whereas the denominator refers to the total disposable
income of all households. To be informative, the denominator should be the total
disposable income of households with mortgages. Up-to-date data using this
measure is unavailable but we know that the ratio of total secured debt to total
income of secured debt holders exhibited no upward trend from 1997 to 2001.
13. Despite the above, could record levels of household debt cause serious
macroeconomic problems in the future? There are three frequently used
arguments. The first is based on the possibility that households have
underestimated true real interest rates. In the high inflation era prior to 1993,
debts were rapidly eroded. This no longer happens and perhaps households do not
fully recognise this fact. However, the young, who tend to be the most indebted
(relative to their income and assets) and hence the most endangered, were not
financially aware in the pre-1993 era, so there is little reason to think they are not
making sensible judgments on this score. Indeed, overall, there are no strong
reasons why households, or indeed lenders, should be behaving particularly
imprudently. Nor is there any persuasive evidence that they are doing so.
14. The second argument is that the economy will be a more fragile place in the future
if households have very high levels of debt. In particular, in response to a future
adverse shock, higher debt levels would lead to bigger falls in consumption and a
bigger economic slowdown. However, since debt service charges are the problem
here, in a higher debt world adverse shocks could be offset by a more vigorous
monetary policy response.
15. The third argument is very simple. If more people have big mortgages, a collapse
in the housing market has more serious macroeconomic consequences. Of course,
if this were thought to be a serious issue, one solution is a policy to reduce the size
of the owner-occupied sector. More council houses, perhaps. But, in the present
situation, does this mean we should use policy to discourage people from taking
out mortgages? In my view, this should not be the target of monetary policy.
16. This leads to the final question, should we keep interest rates higher than would be
required to hit the inflation target in the medium term in order not to encourage
further debt accumulation? In the light of all the previous points, my answer, at
present, would be no.

2. This is based on a long-run rate of house price inflation of 4.5% (in line with trend
average earnings growth) and council tax rises of 6.5% a year (the average gap
between council tax rises and RPIX inflation over the last seven years is around 4
percentage points).
3. The housing depreciation element of RPIX is supposed to capture the contribution
to the cost of living of the costs associated with maintaining homes in response to
their natural tendency to depreciate over time – eg. replacing the roof when
necessary. This element was only introduced into the RPI in 1995 as a
consequence of the majority recommendation of the RPI Advisory Committee
(see CSO, 1994). This majority recommendation suggested that the costs
associated with putting right the depredations of ageing in homes was best
measured by a distributed lag on house prices. As the closely argued minority
view expressed by Michael Fleming, Rita Maurice and Ralph Turvey noted, there
was a serious problem here, namely that a substantial proportion of the rise in the
price of housing reflects a rise in the price of land. Since land does not depreciate,
the price of housing does not accurately reflect housing depreciation costs, indeed
it typically overstates them (although not always; it probably understates them
when house prices are falling). Arguably, some index of building costs would
probably have been a better indicator of housing depreciation costs.
4. In terms of HICP inflation, we currently have a target which is 1.7 (2.5 less 0.8).
This is moved up to 2.0 after the switch. So if r is the nominal rate, the real rate
shifts from (r-1.7) to (r-2.0). If the real rate is to remain unchanged, the nominal
rate must be 0.3 pp higher after the switch.
5. See Cox et al. (2002) for data up to 2000. A recent survey by NMG research
suggests that this has remained more or less true up to 2003.
6. See Nickell (2002) for a detailed analysis.
7. Simply to clarify, household savings are equal to their net acquisition of financial
assets shown in Figure 8 plus their net acquisition of real assets, basically housing.
8. This is not a new point. Robert Barrie, UK economist at CSFB is quoted in Philip
Thornton’s 30 July Independent article as saying precisely this. As he notes,

22

“those who focussed on debt liabilities often forgot to mention the fact that
households had also bought piles of assets”.
