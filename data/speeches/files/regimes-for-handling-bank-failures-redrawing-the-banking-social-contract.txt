BRITISH BANKERS’ ASSOCIATION ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL BANKING
CONFERENCE: RESTORING CONFIDENCE – MOVING FORWARD
30 JUNE 2009
REGIMES FOR HANDLING BANK FAILURES: REDRAWING THE BANKING
SOCIAL CONTRACT

Thank you very much to the BBA for inviting me today. It is a real pleasure to be here when
so much is being debated about the future of the financial system. I’d like to use the occasion
to develop some of the emerging thoughts of the international official sector on the
environment – the ‘rules of the game’ or Social Contract – within which banks will need to
operate in future.

Banks’ liquidity risks and the banking Social Contract

The defining characteristic of banks lies in the liquidity services you provide to the economy,
and in the consequent liquidity risks that you run. History shows that banks are inherently
fragile. Banks are vulnerable to deposit runs. The current crisis has revealed, if it needed to
be, that the same goes for money market funds. And it turned out that big securities dealers
had effectively been turned into quasi banks by funding themselves partly from balances held
by prime-brokerage hedge-fund clients; balances that could be withdrawn on demand, and in
some cases were. So what I have to say is about the economic substance of banking liquidity
risk, not its legal form.

While banks have also suffered capital shortfalls as this crisis progressed, at least in its early
stages liquidity was at its core. As our capital markets and the trading activities of our banks
expanded, the risk-management paradigm was that the liquidity of markets would be resilient.
It is surprising that some big banks, not all, ran such truly massive maturity mismatches. And
it is similarly surprising that many medium-sized banks in this country had liquidity portfolios
comprising largely floating rate notes issued by other banks. Yes, it does of course cost more
to hold gilts and other highly liquid assets; but an illusory liquidity portfolio just transfers the
risk to the central bank or the government.

Some banks and building societies have not looked distress in the eye over the past year and in
earlier years endeavoured to run their business safely, foregoing some of the profits of the

boom. But I would urge even them to recognise that their relatively calm passage through the
crisis to date owes a lot to government standing behind their peers.

The banking Social Contract

That support cannot go on forever, which underlines why the Social Contract for banks must be
redrawn.

It must be redrawn to reflect the lessons from the crisis. And also to mark a credible shift in
regime so that, as an industry, you can re-establish trust and stand on your own feet.

Traditionally, there have been three elements to the Social Contract for banking. In exchange
for being allowed to profit from taking the risks inherent in providing liquidity, or monetary
and credit, services to the economy, banks have been subject to prudential regulation; given
access to liquidity insurance at the central bank; and required to finance industry-wide
insurance schemes to protect depositors. All three components have needed to be redesigned.

I offered a few thoughts on the first – the regulation of banks – at the conference on the FSA’s
Turner Report a few weeks ago. On microprudential supervision. I wanted to add four points.
First, that supervisors must be expert, unafraid to substitute their judgment for that of
management and the board where necessary, but restrain themselves from doing so except
when needed. Second, that concentrated exposures, on either side of the balance sheet, must be
limited. Third, that complex structures rendering a bank unsupervisable must not be permitted,
as the BCCI crisis taught us nearly twenty years ago. And fourth, that regulatory requirements
for capital, liquidity and so on should take into account how much risk a bank brings to the
system as a whole. As one of my predecessors, George Blunden said over twenty years ago,
“Supervisory standards are set with an eye to protecting [banks] from problems which could be
created by wider, systemic developments. A bank may consider a course of action it wishes to
take to be acceptable – as it may well be in a limited context. But the same course might, if
widely copied by other banks, have unfortunate effects on the banking system as a whole. It is
part of the supervisors’ job to take that wider, systemic view and sometimes to curb practices
which even prudent banks might, if left to themselves, regard as safe.”1 All four points are old
verities.

2

On the second plank of the banking Social Contract, I set out the Bank’s current thinking on
liquidity insurance in Tokyo a few weeks ago.2 The Bank has introduced new permanent
liquidity facilities for banks, whereby we stand ready to lend to viable banks against a very
wide range of collateral, on terms designed to avoid encouraging imprudent liquidity
management. And this year we have effectively been acting as a Market Maker of Last Resort
in certain corporate-credit markets. Given the significance of capital markets in today’s
financial system, central banks need to think about whether or not such operations should be a
permanent part of their armoury.

Today, I want to outline our thinking on the third element of the Social Contract. Taking it to
be about only deposit insurance turns out to be too narrow. It is really about what society
should demand of banks to make their failures marginally more tolerable.

It is not often a central banker can speak openly about bank failures. Indeed, most of the time,
central bankers avoid public remarks on issues like Too Big To Fail; Emergency Liquidity
Assistance; flaws in insolvency regimes; burden sharing between national authorities, and so
on. But surrounded as we are by failed banks, it is not only possible to talk about bank failures
without scaring the horses; it would be irresponsible not to do so. And as central bankers and
regulators free themselves from that mental straight jacket, new and perhaps far reaching ideas
are emerging.

They amount to redrawing the third element of the Social Contract between the authorities and
the banks.

To recap, the third element has been that the banking system should bear the cost of insuring
retail depositors with banks against loss. The lessons go, narrowly, to the construction of such
insurance; but also to a broader reformulation in which deposit insurance is just one component
of the overall package.

Deposit insurance: risk-based premia and pre-funding

For most of the past thirty years, deposit insurance in the UK applied to modest amounts, and
provided less than 100% cover of the insured amount. The element of ‘co-insurance’ was
intended to leave retail depositors with an incentive to take care where they deposited their
3

savings. It turned out to be naïve on two fronts. First, it proved unrealistic to expect
households generally to take such care. And second, it brought politics into bank rescues,
because of the hardship that could still be suffered by regular depositors when their bank failed.
Nearly a decade ago I became convinced of the need for 100% insurance of a meaningful
amount in order, as I put it in internal exchanges, ‘to take politics out of crisis management’.

In the wake of Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley, the FSA moved to 100% insurance of
£50K. That means that nearly all regular households in this country are completely protected;
and when today I refer, rather approximately, to “100% insurance”, that is what I mean.3

The Bank’s view has been that in such a system, the banking system’s contribution to the
insurance scheme should be risk-based and pre-funded. The industry has been more doubtful
about the idea of pre-funding and so I want to explain our thinking.

A system of 100% insurance of a meaningful amount changes the landscape.

First, it alters the purposes of bank regulation. It is no longer really about protecting
depositors, as the vast majority are wholly protected by the insurance scheme. From a micro
perspective, it is essentially about minimising risks to, and losses at, the deposit insurer, the
UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Second, it also potentially alters the dynamics of the market place. It makes it easier for banks
to pay up for deposits; the signal that a bank will take greater risk than otherwise, as it would
have to, does not matter to the depositors. They are covered, and so simply enjoy the higher
returns on their deposits. If the bank succeeds, the rewards are reaped by shareholders and
management; if it fails, retail creditors get repaid in full. This doesn’t feel like a stable regime.
And it is worth remembering that President Roosevelt seriously hesitated before introducing
the equivalent FDIC scheme in the US in the 1930s for precisely that reason.

One way of addressing these risks – and the approach eventually being tried in the US – would
be to make such risk-taking banks pay a higher levy into the insurance scheme. Risk-based
premia would help to offset the incentives otherwise created. And, of course, any such
insurance scheme must be pre-funded; it is no good trying to collect levies from riskier banks
after they have gone bust. That is why the Bank has advocated this course.
4

Another route would be to seek to address banks’ perverse incentives via idiosyncratic, riskbased capital requirements; ie active use of Pillar II of the Capital Accord, which is desirable in
any case.

One can argue that the two routes could be equivalent for the banking system as a whole. In a
system of risk-based premia, the ex ante levies on ‘safe and sound’ banks would obviously be
lower than those on their riskier peers. In a system of variable capital requirements, the burden
on the FSCS and so the ex post levies on the surviving ‘safe and sound’ banks should
crystallise less frequently, and perhaps also be smaller, the greater the amount of capital a
riskier, failed bank had to carry. But it is not so straightforward. Unlike the US, the UK does
not have a regime of ‘depositor preference’, which means that the FSCS ranks alongside
(rather than ahead of) ordinary wholesale creditors and so shares losses with them. The riskreducing benefits of extra risk-based capital would, therefore, be spread over creditors
generally, not just insured depositors and the FSCS. Risk-based premia protect the FSCS, and
so the wider banking system, in a more targeted way. The two approaches could probably be
made equivalent by making Pillar II/risk-based capital add-ons sensitive to the total scale of a
bank’s unsecured funding – wholesale as well as retail. For this purpose, the maturity of the
unsecured wholesale funding is irrelevant, so this would not be the same thing as saying that
capital requirements should take into account a bank’s wholesale liquidity risk, and might take
us beyond anything being contemplated by regulators at present.

Even without risk-based premia, pre-funding ensures that failed banks do make a contribution.
And it has other advantages. First, it avoids the potentially pro-cyclical effects of collecting
contributions on a pay-as-you-go basis, ie just when the banking system is weak, Pre-funding
may be a useful step in reducing the financial system’s pro-cyclical tendencies.

Second, subject to appropriate constraints, the insurance fund could be available for use in
resolutions that avoid liquidation and payout under the deposit-insurance scheme. That is the
approach in the US. And it brings me to the broader elaboration of the banking Social
Contract.

Resolving bank distress: information needs

As the 2007 Northern Rock disaster demonstrated and as the Governor explained at the
Treasury Select Committee in September of that year, each country needs a Special Resolution
Regime for banks, enabling economically essential banking functions and so confidence to be
preserved in the event of distress. The UK now has such a regime.

But delivering effective resolutions is not just a matter of the official sector introducing
legislation and equipping an authority, in the UK’s case the Bank, with resources to use it.

It also, crucially, requires banks to structure themselves so as to permit orderly resolution.
That, it can now been seen, is the better version of the third element of the banking Social
Contract.

What does it mean?

In the first place, it entails banks maintaining up-to-date information on their retail deposits in a
way that facilitates rapid payout under the FSCS. Rapid payout is necessary to maintain the
confidence of depositors in other banks. It’s all very well most retail depositors being 100%
protected, but not so comforting if they had to wait ages to receive repayment from the deposit
insurer after their bank had failed. In the UK, the FSCS will be working hard to address this
issue.4 Until rapid payout is feasible, where a buyer for the whole bank for some other solution
cannot be found it is more likely than otherwise that distressed banks will be resolved via the
SRR, with deposit books transferred where possible to other banks.

But I stress ‘where possible’, because this general approach depends on there being bidders for
deposit books. That cannot be guaranteed. So banks must invest in the information systems to
be able to provide the FSCS pretty well instantly with what they need for rapid payout. EU
directives specify a target for payout within 20 days. Something like a week would probably
be more reassuring. Speeding up the process will require banks to keep information on, for
example, all the deposits a person has with a banking group which are eligible for deposit
insurance; and the closing balance, including interest due, each day on eligible deposits. Banks
would also need to be able to transmit all that information, on demand, to the FSCS. Getting to

6

that point will require time. There is a case for debating whether it should be a regulatory
requirement.

The information I outlined is not needed just when a bank does actually go into liquidation and
the FSCS makes a payout to depositors. It is also needed by the Bank of England to assess
whether any of the Special Resolution Regime (SRR) tools could meet the statutory objectives
of the 2009 Act more effectively than liquidation. Indeed, that is why the Bank has a clear
interest in the information provided to the FSCS.

In fact, even more information is needed when we employ the SRR instead of liquidation.
Using the new Act, the Bank, working the FSA and HMT, can split up a bank or building
society into a number of pieces: deposits going to one buyer; some assets possibly to
another; parts going into administration. Effective execution of an operation of this kind is
very information intensive. For example, it requires banks to have up-to-date, coherent
management accounts for all parts of the business. One might think that would be a good
idea anyway. It should certainly be a requirement now.

Execution also requires detailed information on how the business is run. Just a few
examples. First, on the services that different parts of the group provide to each other,
because if split up they may have to agree so-called Transitional Service Agreements.
Second, on which essential services have been outsourced. Third, on details of netting and
derivative contracts, so that the Bank can apply various statutory safeguards for creditors.
That is a formidable task, and it is striking that, in the US, the FDIC has introduced a
requirement that troubled banks must be able to demonstrate that, if necessary, they could
report each day the details of so-called Qualifying Financial Contracts, which are essentially
derivatives. We may need to contemplate something along those lines in the UK.

All of that is needed after buyers for the business have been found. Potential bidders for all
or part of an ailing bank will themselves need the kinds of information typically offered to
bidders in a ‘friendly’ M&A transaction. So there is a case for banks routinely maintaining
such a Data Room as part of their crisis contingency plans. In delivering its resolution
responsibilities under the 2009 Banking Act, the Bank is ready to work with banks and the
FSA in helping to specify in more detail what is needed in practice. If the information can
be ready almost routinely the execution of resolutions would be aided.
7

In summary, as a consequence of its new statutory role, the Bank can have a need for a lot of
information about banks getting into distress. That might usefully be seen alongside the
information needed before a bank reaches the point of being unviable, when it might apply to
draw on the Bank’s public liquidity insurance facilities, notably the Discount Window. And
beyond that, a bank might seek Emergency Liquidity Assistance, where the Bank acts under
the Tripartite MoU.5 In either circumstance, the Bank will need information on the bank’s
liquidity position and planning, and a lot of detailed information on the collateral it would be
offering. I therefore urge the BBA’s members to send the Bank (as well as, of course, the
FSA) your Contingency Funding Plans; and, secondly, to pre-position collateral with us for the
DWF.

Overall, we need to engage together constructively on what information the authorities need in
order to handle incipient or actual distress.

Orderly wind down: writing ‘wills’

There is a broader issue lurking in the background here, and in today’s environment we can
and must address it openly.

Last Friday, in the Bank’s latest Financial Stability Report, we emphasised the importance
going forward of enhancing market discipline, notably through much better disclosures. But
proposals for greater market discipline are not going to gain traction in the real world – the
only world that matters – so long as wholesale creditors and others believe and act on the basis
that some firms can be Too Big To Fail. And, of course, it is not just TBTF. It can be Too
Interconnected To Fail too. And it is not just a problem with so-called LCFIs. As
demonstrated by the UK’s Secondary Banking Crisis in the 1970s, contagious distress amongst
smaller banks can threaten stability more widely when they are afflicted by shared underlying
problems: Too Similar To Fail, as one international colleague put it. And thinking of the place
of some banks or building societies in their local communities, we can also confront Too
Popular To Fail.6 Putting aside that last notion, the solid point is that whether or not one
firm’s distress has systemic consequences will, as a general matter, depend on the
circumstances; but, very awkwardly, there are some firms, and some financial-infrastructure
providers, whose distress would currently be systemic in almost any imaginable circumstances.
8

We need to sort all that out one way or another. It is part of a wider debate about the future
structure of the industry. The Bank is contributing to that debate, and a number of options
were discussed in our Financial Stability Report last week, including as the Governor said at
the Mansion House a fortnight ago, whether or not banks' activities should be regulated more
heavily or even in the extreme restricted. That debate is obviously difficult, with no easy
answers. But it is important, and cannot be ducked. As the Governor proposed at the Mansion
House, it would help greatly if your banks could write a ‘will’ for how they could be wound
down in an orderly way in the face of distress. Indeed, that now has to be part of the banking
Social Contract.

It must surely entail a radical simplification of some group structures. Moving from, say, two
thousand legal entities to one thousand would, somehow, miss the point.

This will not be easy. We do understand that. But it is important to bring about the kind of
regime shift necessary to restore confidence and trust in the industry without a government
prop.

The degree to which banking groups cannot deliver on this should be reflected over time in
capital and liquidity requirements. As well as making distress itself less likely, that would also
help to shift incentives in a healthy direction.

I have talked throughout about banks. But the authorities will need to consider how far this
approach should extend. The Treasury already has power to put bank holding companies into
Temporary Public Ownership, but none of the regular SRR toolkit is available. And the
Treasury is also consulting on how investment banking distress should be handled in the light
of the problems with the Lehmans insolvency and administration since last autumn.7

Cross-border resolutions

There is also a vital cross-border element to all of this, which absolutely must be recognised
and tackled if we are to establish sounder foundations for a world of free, global capital
markets.

9

Around thirty-five years ago the founding document of the rules of the game for international
banking was issued: the Basel Concordat for the supervision of internationally active banks.
Although updated in the early 1980s to embrace consolidated supervision in the wake of Banco
Ambrosiano’s collapse, its essential precepts have remained unchanged.8 Home supervisors
carry the responsibility for consolidated supervision. Broadly, hosts carry little or no
responsibility for branches, other than for liquidity, although it is not easy to pin down what
that means; but hosts carry somewhat greater responsibility for the soundness of subsidiaries.
(Within well-defined regional areas, variants can operate: eg passporting within the EU.)

The point of rehearsing all that familiar stuff is that the division of labour for supervision of
banks during peacetime absolutely must be consistent with the insolvency and other regimes
that would operate in the event of failure or distress. Bluntly, it is no good assuming that an
internationally active bank can be regulated as a single unit if, when distress comes, differences
in the insolvency or resolution regimes of the various countries in which it operates effectively
split the bank into a series of de facto distinct, local entities.

The extra complications are legion, revolving around banking practice as well as resolution
regimes.

For example, if a group employs central liquidity management, as has been not uncommon,
host supervisors and creditors may wake up the morning after a failure to find that all the
group’s surplus liquidity is in another jurisdiction, available first to creditors there. This kind
of thing can unhelpfully alter the incentives for home regulators to be full and frank in their
exchanges with host supervisors. We should not overlook that when extolling the merits of
colleges of supervisors. But those problems should, given sufficient will and common
commitment, be trackable.

Even more difficult are the entanglements and conflicts between home and host insolvency and
resolution laws. There is, for example, a first-order difference between single-entity
insolvency regimes and separate-entity regimes.9 The latter, for example in the US for foreign
banks, have the effect of de facto ring-fencing local assets for local depositors. And even in
countries that basically operate a single-entity regime, some (including the UK) would have the
option of putting a branch into liquidation pre-emptively to de facto ring fence it before the
home authorities had established a whole-bank insolvency procedure.
10

These issues are not new. In the aftermath of the BCCI closure, which affected many
countries, the BCBS produced a paper in 1992 on the difficulties confronted.10 Arguably, the
authorities pulled their punches slightly. But, in any case, so far as I can tell, nothing was done
outside of Europe, where insolvency law for banks was adapted. In particular, the EU adopted
the Credit Institutions Reorganisation and Winding-Up Directive, albeit after quite a delay in
2001, under which a single-entity regime was introduced for the resolution of any bank
incorporated in the EEA, applying to the parent bank and also to all its branches throughout the
EEA.

A little less than a decade after the BCBS’s report on the lessons from BCCI, the
FSF/G10/BCBS produced a joint report on the orderly wind down of large and complex
financial institutions. It was a good report. It called for a range of things, including Factbooks
on key firms; contingency funding plans; wider crisis management plans; and so on. Perhaps
most important, it underlined that, at that time, no one really knew how to wind down an LCFI.
Quite a conclusion. A good one. It is a pity that the report wasn’t published. So far as I can
see, nothing much was done, internationally.

We now have another chance. A new round of work is now underway in the BCBS to identify
impediments or complications arising from national insolvency laws, resolution regimes, or
supervisory practices. I would be amazed if that group does not identify some material issues,
for the reasons I have discussed. If so, they should not be dismissed by the Top Brass, left to
worry only middle-ranking technocrats, as seems to have happened nearly twenty years ago.

Perhaps most important, in April, the Financial Stability Forum (now renamed the Financial
Stability Board) issued Principles for Cross-Border Co-operation on Crisis Management. But
what really matters is that they were endorsed by the G20 Heads of Government at their
subsequent Summit. Which means that there is political endorsement for national authorities to
dilute their narrow attachment to local interests, recognising that in globalised markets their
interests will often best be served through co-operative solutions. Either that, or the structure
of international banking may have to change.

Given the starting point, the Principles are demanding. For each of the most important global
banks, the aim is that home and host authorities (regulators and central banks) should work
11

together to identify obstacles to effective management of crises. To that end, home authorities
are charged with ensuring that firms are capable of supplying the information needed to
manage a crisis. And firms are strongly encouraged to maintain contingency plans to wind
themselves down – as I have already said today, the Bank would like there to be consideration
of whether that could be a requirement for operating in the UK. And, as I also made clear
earlier, we do realise that all of that will be formidable, best approached with an international
consensus.

Similarly demanding is the requirement in the Principles that countries ‘strive’ to find
internationally co-ordinated solutions, sharing information as freely as practicable. That is not
something which one could say has always been apparent over the past two years, although it
worked well on market operations. As the Principles recognise, the drive for greater openness
between authorities should not be permitted to jeopardise effective resolution through leaks or
pre-emptive action to ring-fence local interests.

I am reporting this because the FSB Principles have not got as much coverage as they warrant.
Yet it is very important that the banking world appreciates that, alongside other issues and
initiatives I have outlined this morning, they have the potential – indeed, are intended – to
bring about material changes in the way you structure your businesses, in how you interact
with the authorities, and in the wider environment in which you operate.

I hope that the Financial Stability Board Working Group on the Crisis Management Principles
will not hesitate to report back to the FSB, and through it to alert G20 Ministers, if
implementation is or looks to be stalling – whether because it is meeting with resistance from
the authorities or the industry, or blockages in national laws and practices.

Concluding comment

This crisis has reminded a generation of some old truths. Banks can fail. But they matter
enormously to our economies, and so the authorities cannot afford to stand back and allow
disorderly systemic failure. Going forward, we cannot have a regime where the upside for
risk-taking goes to shareholders and management, but the downside falls to the general
taxpayer.

12

All three elements of the Social Contract for banking need to be reformed. Better regulation
and supervision, including a macroprudential element. Better arrangements for liquidity
insurance, which the Bank has tried to introduce alongside our international peers. And, my
main topic today, a new regime for resolving bank distress. In particular, banks must structure
and run themselves to permit orderly wind down. And they must invest to provide the
authorities with the information they need to do so.

This will not be easy. And it will not be cheap. Together with higher capital and liquidity
requirements – lower leverage and reduced maturity transformations – over time it may well
mean a lower headline return on equity for some banks. But, of course, it would also entail
lower risk for bank equity and bond investors, and surely it is risk-adjusted returns that matter.
And it would also deliver lower risk to society more generally, which matters hugely.

To be clear, we want banks and the financial sector more generally to thrive. The institution I
come from believes in a market economy, in capitalism. The financial sector has played an
enormous role in the development of modern economies. But a regime in which banks can
thrive standing on your own feet would be a better market – for all of us.

In a single-entity insolvency regime, the home country authorities would seek to apply a single main
insolvency proceeding to a bank incorporated in their jurisdiction and to all its branches in other
countries. This is sometimes referred to as a universal approach to cross-border insolvency. This
contrasts with a separate-entity insolvency regime, in which separate insolvency proceedings may be
applied to the parent bank (by the home country) and its branches in other countries (by host countries);
this constitutes a territorial approach to cross-border insolvency.

rules may be relevant to the manner in which multinational banks are supervised; 3) differences in
