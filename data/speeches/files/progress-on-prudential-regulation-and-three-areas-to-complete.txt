My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen - it is a great pleasure to be here again at the regulators dinner, and
it is very good of you to entice so many people here tonight with the prospect of an evening with regulators. I
won’t speculate on how this ranks on the scale of evenings spent in our cosmopolitan capital city. It is also a
great pleasure to be speaking here tonight with Tracey.

This evening I want to describe the progress we have made on prudential regulation and then examine a
number of topical issues for the PRA and the Financial Services industry: the Senior Managers and
Certification Regime; structural reform and ring fencing; and what the PRA is doing to pursue its secondary
objective on competition. A common theme here is getting the incentives right to support good outcomes in
relation to both prudential and conduct objectives.

Progress
It is over eight years now since the financial crisis began in this country. And to continue Tracey’s theme for
a moment, it is possibly salutary to recall that amidst the many bad events of Autumn 2007, England reached
the Final of the Rugby World Cup. I didn’t expect to say “those were the days” about 2007. It was natural
that the first response to the financial crisis in terms of reforms was focused on the bedrock prudential issues
of capital and liquidity in banks. This has been supplemented by the drive both internationally and
domestically to solve the too big to fail problem through a combination of resolution measures at the centre
of which is agreement on total loss absorbing capacity for those banks which require such a bulwark to
ensure orderly resolution in the event of failure. This is crucial to break the dependence of failing banks on
injections of public money and likewise to break the impact of solvency problems in banks on the public
finances.

This is an international as well as domestic agenda of reforms aimed at fixing the fault lines that caused the
financial crisis, building a more resilient and open global financial system, and deepening and building trust
across jurisdictions. I have said before, but I think it justifies repeating, that we are unwavering supporters of
an open global financial system which finances the investment and trade necessary to support strong,
sustainable and balanced growth. As we see and seek to deal with new risks to the world economy and to
global financial stability it is always important to remember that free trade and free capital flows are the
foundation of a successful world economy with all the benefits that brings for the welfare of people.

So, it should be no surprise that our focus is on three things: first, full, consistent and prompt implementation
of the already agreed reforms across the financial system, and here I would note that the largest single
activity for the PRA this year is to complete the implementation of Solvency 2 for insurers for the end of this
year, something I believe we are on course to do; secondly, finalising the design of the remaining post-crisis
reforms and thus providing the much needed clarity around the future regulatory system; and thirdly,
scanning the horizon for new risks and vulnerabilities that appear on our landscape, ones such as the risk of
cyber disruption.

I think there is solid evidence of progress in all of these three areas. Internationally, there is plenty of
evidence of shared objectives and effective co-operation among national authorities to solve common
problems and “own” and thus implement the resulting reforms. An example over the last year has been the
building of strong working relations between the PRA and our colleagues at the Single Supervisory
Mechanism of the ECB. This can only be for the good, and represents the much needed close working of
people who are on the front line supervising the system.

We also want to encourage sound market-based finance and we are, for example, strong supporters of the
EU initiative on simple, transparent and standardised securitisation.

Finalising design

When I look at the remaining agenda of post-crisis reforms to be agreed, it is striking that they are not about
capital levels in the same way that we saw immediately post-crisis. True, there is work in Basel but that is
much more about refining the framework than a step change in capital requirements. As part of this there is
work to agree and implement the leverage ratio internationally, and to improve the use of models to estimate
capital requirements so that they are used only for asset classes that lend themselves to modelling of this
sort and we have an acceptable degree of consistency across banks.

There are two important points I want to draw out which are by no means uncontroversial. First, it is
sometimes said that the banking system still needs markedly more capital, and that a focus on other issues
is a distraction from tackling a system that is still over-leveraged. The second, closely-related, point is that
we should focus much more exclusively on non-risk based measures of capital requirements.
I don’t agree with either of these positions, and nor would I say do most supervisors I know. I have been and
remain a strong supporter of the reforms to date and the higher levels of capital put in place, and I am a
strong supporter of having the leverage ratio in our toolkit and that for some assets it is the “biting” approach
and therefore it is not just a backstop. But I disagree with those who want to go much further, for reasons
which are at the heart of what we are doing.

First, because to argue for much higher capital on top of what has been done since the crisis is to argue that
what is being done on resolution and loss absorbency is of little use. This misses the point that resolution is
about being able to stabilise and then where necessary close or restructure failing banks. In other words,
resolution is a much more extensive approach, and in my view very necessary. The design of international
policy measures to end too big to fail is now largely complete for banks, but substantial work remains to put
these into effect in terms of resolution plans.

Second, understanding how banks take and manage risk, the controls they have and the quality of risk
management, is at the heart of the job of a prudential supervisor. That’s what we do every day, and the
standards of this work have been raised extensively since the crisis, which was very necessary. Now, it is
possible I suppose to argue that a focus on oversight of risk management should be pursued alongside a
sole focus on a non-risk based capital measure like the leverage ratio. But in my view that is a flawed
argument because the prevailing capital regime has a strong influence on how firms take and manage risk, in
other words it creates the incentives. And, if we only used a non-risk based system, we would incentivise
firms to disregard the amount of risk per unit of assets on their balance sheet. The leverage ratio is firmly in
the camp of necessary but not sufficient, as is the risk-based approach.

The third reason why I disagree with the much more capital school of thought is because there are more
important things for us to do, which revolve around getting the incentives for behaviour right in firms. This is
why as supervisors, both prudential and conduct, we spend so much time on governance in firms and on
getting the incentives aligned for individuals through our approach to remuneration and to the responsibility
of individuals.

We have achieved much progress towards strengthening the resilience of the global banking system, with
stronger capital ratios, and this has demonstrated in my view the important principle that appropriately strong
capital positions support rather than deter lending by banks.

Jobs still to finish: three topical issues

The Senior Managers Regime

The Senior Managers and Certification regime for banks is a product of the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards chaired by Andrew Tyrie, put into legislation and to be implemented by the PRA and FCA
by next March, so not long to go now. The current approved persons regime has not delivered effective
incentives and thus behaviour.
As part of last week’s announcement on the Bank of England and Financial Services Bill, the Government
put forward an important change to the senior managers regime for banks, by removing the “presumption of
responsibility” and replacing it with a “duty of responsibility”. I can tell you from my postbox in all its many
forms, that the “presumption” is the most controversial element of the new regime. On its own that is not a
good reason for change. I want therefore to explain why the change does make sense, and why the new
regime should create the right incentives.

In the current Approved Persons regime, the PRA and FCA can take formal action for misconduct against an
approved person either if that person has failed to comply with the statements of principle (which will become
in the new regime common rules of professional conduct) or they have been knowingly concerned in a
breach of a regulatory requirement by the firm. The burden of proof in an enforcement action falls on the
regulator.

The Banking Reform Act adds a third reason to take enforcement action against senior managers (not
others) in these firms if: the firm (and I emphasise here the firm – going beyond the individual) has breached
regulatory requirements; and the senior manager is responsible for the area of the firm in which the breach
occurred. The Act goes on to say that the person would not be guilty of misconduct if they satisfy the
Regulator that they have taken such steps a person in that position could reasonably be expected to take to
prevent the breach. For the first two limbs the burden of proof would fall on the Regulator in the same way
as the continuing provisions I mentioned earlier. But, crucially, it would be for the senior manager to satisfy
the Regulator on the question of reasonableness – thus the presumption is created until it is rebutted.
The change that the Government has announced to create “the duty of responsibility” will, if Parliament
approves it, replace the presumption with a statutory duty on senior managers to take reasonable steps to
prevent breaches of regulatory requirements by their firms from occurring. Thus it will be for the Regulator to
show that the senior manager did not take such steps as it was reasonable for a person in that position to
take to prevent the breach of regulatory requirements.
In my view this does not represent a watering down of the requirement. Why? Well the “duty of
responsibility” creates a positive duty on senior managers to take reasonable steps to prevent regulatory
breaches occurring. This will be on a statutory footing, which hardwires the concept in the very fabric of the
regulatory regime, rightly reflecting the importance which society places on this issue.
Let me be very clear, substituting “duty” for “presumption” changes the mechanism of enforcement not the
substance of the requirement on senior managers, and I would not support changing the latter. There has
been a lot of noise around the new regime in recent months, and I have asked people involved whether their
problem was with the “presumption”, or with the regime more broadly. The universal answer has been that
the difficulty was with the “presumption” not the regime which appears to have broad support.

So, if Parliament is in agreement, and I do not presume to take that for granted, I expect that the new regime
will be put into effect in the spirit with which it is intended, and that the focus will shift to that spirit and away
from finding ways to circumvent the “presumption”. To be blunt, I hope that those within firms and their
advisors will respect the will of Parliament on this crucial point.

The new regime matters hugely for getting the right incentives for people running firms. The important word
is not “presumption” or “duty but rather “responsibility”, it’s about holding people more personally to account.
If there are people who wish to argue that they should not take on the responsibilities of the job they do, then
I believe they have no place in the industry, it’s that simple. We all want well-run firms where senior people
lead and take responsibility. And I know that this is how the vast majority of people do behave, because I
observe it.

The senior managers and certified persons regime is also not purely, or in my view even primarily, a tool of
enforcement. Our job is always to apply forward-looking judgement to prevent problems occurring; and the
new regime will ensure that the incentives on senior managers in the roles that they perform align with that
approach. But, just as Parliament has recognised that it is not the PRA’s role to ensure that no firm fails,
likewise we should not expect the Regulators to prevent all failures, or misconduct, by individuals. The
PRA’s enforcement powers are a necessary part of its toolkit, and we will use those tools when the
circumstances warrant it. But they are not our primary mode of operating.
Also, the Government announced last week that – subject to agreement by Parliament – it plans to extend
the Senior Managers regime to other firms across the industry. This is a further step in the right direction.
There is no doubt that one regime will be better than many.

Lastly on the senior managers regime, there is one other very important broad reason for putting it into place.
On and off I have been involved in regulation for over twenty five years. During that time a few regimes have
come and gone, and there have been debates about self-regulation versus a regime more purely in the
hands of public authorities. This debate strikes me as a gross over-simplification. Self-regulation doesn’t
work if there is no clear and consistent allocation of responsibility for the public interest objectives of financial
regulation to public bodies that are answerable to the government and to parliament. But likewise, public
bodies cannot seek to take on the responsibility of managing within firms, something that has to be the
responsibility of boards and management. The senior managers and certification regime is vital here
because it creates the framework to establish effective responsibility within firms, while maintaining the role
of the public authorities, the PRA and FCA, for supervising and enforcing the public interest. A very good
example of how this should work can be seen in the recommendations of the Fair and Effective Markets
Review, which provide a means to establish and maintain high conduct standards in financial markets.

Structural reform

I want now to turn to structural reform and ring fencing. This is a subject in its own right, but I can assure you
that I intend to be brief on this one tonight. We are now well into implementation. Last week we issued our
second consultation paper on implementing the regime, and we plan one more such paper which will be
more in the form of a wrap up of points raised and a few outstanding actions.

Any structural reform measure involves complex implementation, the devil is always in the detail, and we
need to get that right. I read from time to time that we are apparently watering the regime down via the
implementation. I can assure you that we are not doing so, and we should not because that would go
against the will of Parliament. But, sensibly, the regime sensibly allows for a degree of flexibility in how the
requirements are implemented, recognising the differences in business models, legal structure and strategy
of various firms. That was essential and sensible because a rigid definition of the fence would not work well
for all firms.

To ensure balance, I should say that I also get the opposite commentary, that the implementation is too rigid.
One particular form of this commentary is that our rules on the governance of the ring fenced bank within a
group mean that it will be independent in all respects, and that, proverbially, it will be able to stick two fingers
up at its parent. No. The ring fenced bank will have to observe the law in respect of the requirements of ring
fencing, not more than that. This is not really different from the position for banks that have subsidiaries
operating in other countries, they have to respect the laws of the country in which they operate. But, let me
be clear what it does not mean: it does not mean that the ring fenced bank can set its own strategy and
thereby ignore the group to which it belongs; it does not mean that it can set its risk appetite in isolation of
the group to which is belongs; it does not mean that it can refuse to pay a dividend to its parent if it is
adequately capitalised both now and looking forwards using stress tests (in other words, it does not have a
reason to trap excess capital); and it does not mean that its CEO can ignore the Group CEO. But, and this is
crucial, the group cannot require the ring fenced bank to break the rules of ring fencing. I hope this is clear.
If you think we have watered down the regime, please let me know.

Competition

I want to finish on an equally important subject, namely competition in the banking industry, which is of
course topical today in view of the CMA’s report. The PRA has been given by Parliament a so-called
secondary objective which I think is best described as requiring us to act in respect of the competitive
implications of our own actions and inactions but only to the extent that we are not undermining our primary
objective for banks of safety and soundness. We have been working to embed the secondary objective in
the PRA, and to date our most publicised actions have been in the area of new bank authorisations. The
PRA has authorised ten banks in the last two years, and currently we have a substantial pipeline of
interested parties.

We are thinking about competition in our domestic work, but also about how we approach international policy
issues. For instance, this week our response to the European Commission’s consultation on the impact of
the new capital regime has been published. It is quite often said that aspects of the capital regime
discriminate against smaller banks and building societies that use the so-called standardised capital
approach versus larger banks that use their own models. The consequence of this is that smaller banks and
building societies cannot compete effectively in lower risk asset markets such as prime mortgages because
the capital requirements are too far apart and in favour of large banks. This forces them into riskier assets
and undermines their position.

This is an area where the leverage ratio acts to counterbalance the difference, a point that is not well enough
understood. But in our response to the European Commission we said that while the financial stability
benefits from regulation of large, internationally-active banks mean these firms should meet global
standards, a differentiated approach for smaller firms would recognise the high costs and smaller benefits of
applying global standards to them, and should enable us to find ways to create a regime which is more
simple and which reduces their reporting burden. This would help to foster competition and would be good
for the European Single Market. This is an important issue, and one that matters if we are to have growing
challenger banks. We want to put such a regime into effect, and thus demonstrate that at the PRA we are
very serious about our competition objective. I hope the European authorities will likewise pursue this
important change.

We will also be arguing in Basel and in the EU to narrow the gap between standardised and internally
modelled capital requirements for prime mortgages including by having more risk sensitivity in the
standardised approach. And, we have also tightened the standard for models. I also want to be clear that
we welcome internal model applications by smaller banks and we will do what we can to help them meet the
required prudential standards, which are largely set out in the EU legislation.

Lord Mayor, a year in your office is never dull, and likewise our world is certainly full of interest. I have
ranged quite widely this evening to give a report on a number of our key areas of activity. There are however
some very important core principles at the heart of our work, getting the incentives right for firms and
individuals, and establishing the importance of personal responsibility within an appropriate setting. I have
been blunt on one or two points and this may provoke debate. This is a good thing, and we will have the
opportunity to return to the debate on these issues at The Open Forum being organised at the Guildhall on
November 11th. I know you will be there, as will Tracey and I. Please, will everyone participate, and to find
out more consult the Bank of England website. Thank you.
