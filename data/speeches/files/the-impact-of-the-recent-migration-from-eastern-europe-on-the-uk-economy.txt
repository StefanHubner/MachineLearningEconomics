Executive Summary
a) UK population growth over the last thirty-five years has been remarkably low in
comparison with other countries; the population grew by just 7% between 1971 and 2004,
less than all the other EU15 countries (except Germany), Australia, Canada, Japan, New
Zealand and the United States, plus China and India. The rate of UK population growth
did exceed that of six countries from the former Soviet bloc (Czech Republic; Croatia;
Estonia; Hungary; Latvia and Bulgaria), but was below the rates of growth of Poland,
Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
b) The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. This
recent growth has been driven primarily by changes in net migration. Both the inflow
and outflow rates have risen, but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly recently, with an
influx of migrants from eight East European (A8) countries. However, the increase in the
net migration flow predates the influx of A8 migrants, reflecting a steady rise in the
number of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East too.
c) The propensity to migrate to the UK is higher the lower is GDP per capita in each of
the A8 countries. The decision is also strongly correlated with life satisfaction scores and
unemployment rates, but is uncorrelated with employment rates or rates of inflation.
d) There appears to be consistent evidence from the Worker Registration Scheme and
National Insurance Number applications that approximately 500,000 migrants from the
A8 countries had come to work in the UK between May 2004 and late 2006. But other
sources suggest a significant proportion of these workers have likely returned to their
country of origin.
e) The empirical literature from around the world suggests little or no evidence that
immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes such as wages
and unemployment. Recent work by a number of other authors for the UK is also
consistent with this view.
(f) The impact of recent migration from the A8 countries on the UK economy will be
determined by the extent to which immigrants add to supply relative to demand, since it
is the balance between these two factors that determines prospects for inflation. We
argue that, at present, it appears that A8 immigration has tended to increase supply by
more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run), and thereby acted to
reduce inflationary pressures.
(g) There seems to be broad agreement that immigration is likely to have reduced the
natural rate of unemployment in the UK over the past few years. But there is some
uncertainty about what has happened to the natural rate in the very recent past and what
might happen to it in the near future. This is because immigration has not been the only
shock to affect the labour market very recently.

1) Introduction
The recent rise in migration to the UK from eight EU Accession countries (the Czech
Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Poland; Slovakia; and Slovenia – the A8
countries) has generated a good deal of controversy. How many A8 immigrants are there
in the UK? Where did they come from and when? What impact has their influx had on
the UK economy and what likely impacts will they have in the future? Most importantly
for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), what macroeconomic effects have they had?
We attempt to address these questions here. First, we examine the change in population
in the UK over the last thirty-five years and note that growth is very low by international
standards. The UK population has, however, grown at a faster pace since the turn of the
millennium, driven most recently by migration from the A8 nations. It appears that the
propensity to migrate to the UK from these countries is higher the lower is GDP per
capita. Second, we examine the various sources of data that are available on the numbers
of A8 immigrants that have arrived in the UK in recent years. There is broad agreement
from the various data sources on the numbers involved – half a million workers is likely
to be an upper bound for the stock of A8 migrants who are in the UK in late 2006. Many
of the new 'migrants' may have stayed for only a short time and then returned home, to
possibly return again at a later date. Third, we examine the characteristics of the recent
flow of individuals from the A8 countries that have arrived in the UK since accession,
and find that they are relatively young, male, have low unemployment rates, lower wages,
and high self-employment rates and are especially likely to be in temporary jobs. Finally,
we turn to the macroeconomic implications of A8 migration to the UK, and argue that
this immigration has made the labour market more flexible and likely lowered the natural
rate of unemployment and the NAIRU.
1) Population changes
According to official estimates published by the Office for National Statistics, the UK
population grew by just 8.2% between 1971 and 2006, from 55.9 million to 60.5 million.
In contrast, the United States population grew by 44.6% over the same period, from 207.7
million in 1971 to 300.3 million in 2006.2 Indeed population growth across many
countries has been greater than in the UK over the past three decades (Chart 1). Over the
period 1971-2004, population growth in the UK ranks 31st out of 38 European and other
large nations for which data are available (listed in Table 1, excluding Romania), with
only Germany (East and West) and six East European countries having had slower
population growth (Czech Republic; Croatia; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia and Bulgaria).
All the other major industrialised nations have had faster rates of population growth.
Growth was particularly rapid in the US (+42%) as noted above, but also in Australia
(+54%); Canada (+45%); Spain (+25%); Japan (+21%); and France (+18%). The Indian
population roughly doubled over the same period (96%), while the Chinese population
grew by 52%. It is clear that UK population growth has been extremely low by
international standards – it is even below that of Italy (+7.6%).

1. The chart shows the ordering of population growth between
1971 and 2004 of the 38 countries listed in Table 2.

Long-run trends, however, mask some significant short-run changes in population growth
(Chart 2 & Table 2a). The UK population grew by 2.8 million (4.9%) between 1971 and
1999, but the population has subsequently risen by a further 1.8 million (3.2%). The
main cause of this increase has been a rise in net inward migration, driven by an increase
in the inflow rate to the UK; the outflow rate has remained little changed over the years,
although there has been a pickup since 1998. The ratio of births to deaths has seen less
variation. In 2004-5 net migration accounted for two-thirds of the change in population
(248/375). To place these numbers in some degree of context, net (legal) migration in the
United States accounted for approximately one third of net population growth in 20042005.3 Table 2b makes it clear that the scale of net inward migration to the UK has been
much lower than in most other EU countries until recently, and even now remains below
the levels of both Italy and Spain.
In summary, UK population growth appears to have been extremely low by international
standards over the past three decades. As such, it would seem likely that the UK could
absorb a relatively small inflow of immigrants, by international standards. As we note
below, it appears that it has already done so to a considerable degree; the entry of recent
A8 migrants appears to have improved the workings of the labour market, reduced wage
and inflationary pressures and lowered the natural rate of unemployment.

Population in the United States on July 1st 2004 was 293,657,000 increasing to 296,410,000 on July 1st
2005 a net increase of 2,754,000 or 0.94%. This increase was made up of 4,129,000 births, 2,425,000
deaths and net legal migration of 1,050,000. Source: US Census Bureau http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0004.xls

2) Why has immigration to the UK increased since the turn of the millennium?
The increase in net migration coincides with changes in UK immigration policy and the
relative attractiveness of the UK’s economic position over the past decade. Most
recently, the increase in the inflow rate of migrants appears in large part to be attributable
to immigration policy that accompanied the accession of the A8 countries on May 1st
2004;4 citizens from the A8 nations obtained free movement and the right to work in the
UK, Ireland and Sweden from this date.5 But there has continued to be a steady growth
in the inflow of migrants to the UK from non-A8 countries too, especially from the New
Commonwealth.
The literature on immigration focuses on the economic factors that determine migration.
Very simply, the literature says that individuals will compare the income benefits from
migration with the economic and social costs of moving. If the benefits outweigh the
costs, they may choose to migrate. The gain from moving will be calculated as the
expected income differential between the destination country and the country of origin,
which will in turn be determined by the relative probability of getting a job – captured by
differences in the unemployment or employment rates.
Naskoteen and Zimmer (1980) find for the US that a 10 percentage point increase in the
wage differential between the countries of destination and origin increases the probability
of migration by 7 percentage points. Borjas (2005) finds that a 10 percentage point
increase in the rate of employment growth in the state of origin reduces the probability of
migration by approximately 2 percent. There is also evidence that migration is most
common among younger and more educated workers (Borjas 2005). Moreover, workers
who have just migrated are extremely likely to move back to their original locations. The
probability of a migrant returning to the state of origin within a year is about 13 per cent
and the probability of moving to another location is 15 per cent (Devanzo, 1983 and
Dustmann, 2003). Zaiceva (2006) summarises the empirical literature on the potential
migration flows, which he shows to be consistent with between 2 and 4 per cent of the
residents of Central and East European countries (CEECS) moving West, in the long run,
which constitutes around 1 per cent of the EU15 population. Zaiceva also presents
evidence from simulations suggesting that the majority of migrants are predicted to come
from Romania, Poland and Bulgaria, which is consistent with other estimates from the
literature.
Gilpin et al (2006) examine whether A8 citizens have come to the UK because it offers a
higher standard of living (GDP per capita) or a higher probability of getting a job
(measured by the inverse of the unemployment rate), or both. They consider data from
the Worker Registration Scheme (see Appendix A for more details on this data source).
4

In addition Malta and (South) Cyprus also joined the EU at that date. Bulgaria and Romania joined the
EU on January 1st 2007.
5
Finland, Greece, Portugal and Spain opened their labour markets to these workers on May 1st 2006, while
Italy followed in late July 2006. Five other countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg) alleviated restrictions in 2006 (Zaiceva, 2006).

They compute the number of WRS registrations as a percentage of the home country
population and show it is correlated with GDP and unemployment. We update their
analysis in Table A. It is apparent that a larger fraction of people of Lithuania (1.60%);
Latvia (1.25%); Slovakia (0.92%) and Poland (0.79%) have come to the UK compared to
Estonia (0.42%), the Czech Republic (0.24), Hungary (0.14) and Slovenia (0.02) (Table
A). Gilpin et al. find that countries with the lowest GDP per head, such as Lithuania
(2500 Euros) are more likely to be registered on the UK WRS than those from countries
with higher GDP, such as Slovenia (11,400 Euros).6 Workers in the WRS data are also
more likely to come from countries with the highest unemployment rates, such as Poland
(19.0%). Pedersen et al (2004) found similar effects for GDP per capita and the
unemployment rate in both source and destination countries in their study of migration
flows into OECD countries in the 1990s.

The correlation coefficient is clearly highest with 2005 GDP per head, as noted by Gilpin
et al., and even higher when GDP is in logs (r=0.837). The correlation is slightly weaker
with the unemployment rate, but especially low with the employment rate.7
Interestingly, Schiopu and Siegfried (2006) found that the difference in GDP between the
host and home countries increases the size of remittances.

We explored the correlations with each of the components of the HDI, which includes the
life expectancy rate (r=-0.526); the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary,
secondary and tertiary schools (r=-0.005); and GDP per capita (PPP US$) for 2004,
which has an even better correlation (r=-0.823) than the GDP data used by Gilpin et al,
and in logs the correlation is -0.836. It is already well-known that East Europeans are
more likely to report that they are unhappy (Blanchflower, 2000 and Blanchflower and
Freeman 1999). In a recent Candidate Eurobarometer collected between September and
October, 2002 (ICPSR #4062) respondents were asked the following question.
Q. On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all
satisfied with the life you lead? A. Very satisfied=4; Fairly satisfied=3; Not very
satisfied=2; Not at all satisfied=1

8

The HDI is published annually by the United Nations and is a score that amalgamates three indicators:
lifespan; educational attainment and adjusted real income (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005).
9

The correlation is similar with the 2001 life satisfaction score (-0.72), but lower in 2003 (-0.55), 2004 (0.57) and 2005 (-0.58)

5

The means of the life satisfaction score variable correlate reasonably well with the
propensity to migrate (r=-0.751) and considerably better than the unemployment or
employment rates.
In summary, the favourable macroeconomic climate (low unemployment) and high
standard of living in the UK (GDP per capita) are reasons why immigrants from the A8
countries may have been attracted to the UK, and why immigrants from Bulgaria and
Romania may be attracted in the future. The OECD has recently (2006b) projected that
GDP will grow particularly quickly in both Poland and Slovakia over the next couple of
years. The OECD projects a growth rate of around 8% in both 2006 and 2007 in
Slovakia, and 5% in Poland, where, it suggests remittances from migrants will sustain
consumption. The other member of the OECD is Hungary, which is projected to grow at
4% in 2006, but only at 2% in 2007. Rapid GDP growth in some A8 countries and
improvements in their unemployment rates might suggest a reduction in the flows of both
permanent migrants and especially temporary workers to the UK from the A8 countries in
the near future. Pedersen et al (2004) studied migration flows into 27 OECD countries
from 1990-2000 and found that network effects, measured as the coefficient of the stock
of immigrants of own national background already resident in a country, had a large
positive impact on immigration flows. This suggests that rather than dissipate, the flows
may well continue well into the future although the scale of the flow remains uncertain.
Further the Bank’s regional Agents have undertaken a survey of business contacts
concerning their use of migrant labour that suggested that a majority of firms were
expecting to make greater use of such labour into the future.
3) Size of migration flows from the A8
It is difficult to get an exact estimate of the size of the flows of individuals from the A8
countries to the UK since accession. Some estimates suggest that around 500,000 A8
workers have come to the UK, but other sources suggest many fewer. It is also unclear
what proportion of such workers are long-term migrants and what proportion are here for
a short time and have subsequently returned home, perhaps to return again in the future.
The scale and nature of this flow is an important question for policy makers because it
affects the labour market and the wider economy. It is therefore important to try and
understand and reconcile the differences between different data sources as far as possible.
Doing this, we find that 500,000 workers is an upper bound for the stock of postaccession A8 workers in the UK in late 2006.
There are four main sources of data on the flow of A8 individuals. Further details of the
sources are provided in Appendix A. We examine estimates of the numbers using each
data series in turn.
1) Worker Registration Scheme
Table 3 reports the number of workers, by A8 country, who registered, and were
approved for work, on the WRS – a registration scheme for employees from the A8
countries. The self-employed do not need to register under the WRS. The largest
number in every year has come from Poland. Between 2004Q2 and 2006Q3 over
300,000 Poles had registered, which constitutes 63% of the total. The next largest group
(11%) is from Lithuania, which had only 3.4 million residents in 2004, compared with
6

38.2 million in Poland.10 The flows by quarter are very similar. The WRS suggests that
486,660 workers had registered to work in the UK since accession – a further 3,895 were
refused, 1,035 were exempt and 14,950 applications were withdrawn making a grand
total of 510,340 applicants. The three main countries from which migrants have come
are Poland (63%); Lithuania (11%); and Slovakia (10%).
Ireland has been the other major recipient of migrant flows from the A8. According to
Ireland’s National Training and Employment Authority (FÁS), over the first twelve
months to April 2005, 83,000 Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSN) were issued to
EU10 nationals, which is equivalent to almost 4% of Ireland’s labour force. Some of
these people were, however, already in Ireland prior to May 2004. Another 66,000 PPSNs
were issued in the six months from May to October 2005, an increase of 46% on the same
period for the previous year. The OECD (2006a) suggests that the country composition
of A8 workers to Ireland is similar to that of the UK - Poland (54%), Lithuania (19%),
Latvia (9%), and Slovakia (8%).11
2) Total International Migration, predominantly from the International Passenger Survey
Table 4 provides official estimates of migration based on the International Passenger
Survey (IPS), showing changes in the inflow and outflow rates of 'long-term international
migrants' – a migrant is someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for at
least 12 months.12 It is apparent that both have risen steadily since 2002, although the
inflow rate has experienced the more rapid rise. Table 4 suggests that there was a net
positive migration flow of 223,000 in 2004 and a further 185,000 in 2005, making a total
of 408,000. As part of these, the IPS suggests that 132,000 individuals have come to the
UK from the A8 countries, which is a considerably lower number than from the WRS,
why?
Some concerns have been expressed about the accuracy of the data from this source as it
covers only the principal air and sea routes, and the Channel Tunnel. There is evidence
of an increase in the number of passenger journeys terminating at airports not routinely
covered by the IPS – ie to terminals outside of Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester –
particularly to and from Poland (having increased from 516,000 in 2003 to 1,845,000 in
2005) – so some migrants may have been missed.13,14 Furthermore, many of these extra
journeys appear to have resulted from an increase in short-term visits to the UK – those
of less than three months. Table C shows that there has been a steady increase in the
10

Source: Eurostat.

11

OECD (2006, Table 1.22) suggests that the other major recipient countries other than Ireland and the UK
have been Italy (84,000); Norway (36,000) and the USA (21,000).

12

This is the UN-recommended definition of a migrant. See ONS (2006a).

13

See www.caa.co.uk for airline statistics on passenger journeys in and out of the UK.

14

There have also been notable increases in the number of passenger journeys to and from Slovakia (from
29,000 to 284,000) and to and from Latvia (from 61,000 to 309,000), again with the vast majority of the
increases being to airports other than Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester, not routinely covered by the IPS.

number of travellers from the A8 to the UK, consistent with the flights data.15 According
to the ONS, 89% of A8 travellers who came to the UK in 2006, said they intended to stay
less than 3 months.16 The exclusion of these short-term visitors from the count of 'longterm international migrants' may account for the lower estimate of the number of A8
migrants in the IPS than observed in the WRS.

3) National Insurance Numbers (NINos)
Table 5 shows that there has been a sharp rise in the number of A8 individuals that have
requested National Insurance numbers – up from 12,000 in 2002/03 to 270,000 in
2005/06.17 Between April 2004 and March 2006, approximately 380,000 individuals
from the A8 countries had registered for a National Insurance number. This estimate is
more similar to the WRS than the IPS, and the difference appears to reflect the different
time period covered and the inclusion of self-employed workers in the NINo data.
4) Labour Force Survey
It is feasible to obtain estimates of the number of A8 migrants resident in the UK using
population weighted LFS micro-data. To the extent that these population weights
undercount the number of migrants then this would be a source of bias. Results are
reported in Table D.

(2006) for the years 2003-2005 and updates them to 2006 based on Summer quarters in
each year (June, July and August). Data for 2006Q3 (July, August, and September) are
also presented. Around 350,000 nationals from the A8 countries were resident in the UK
by the Summer of 2006, according to the LFS data, of whom 240,000 had arrived since
2004; nearly 85% were workers (220,000). Over time the proportion of A8 migrants who
are workers has risen from 36% to 74%. Somewhat surprisingly, there has been little
change in the number who claim to be self-employed since 2004. The LFS data also
suggest that 20% of all migrants that arrived in the UK between 2004 and 2006Q3 were
Polish, and roughly a third were from the A8 as a whole.
Reconciling the differences
The number of A8 migrants entering the UK since Accession appears quite uncertain
given the available data. But the different sources vary in their coverage, both in terms of
the migrants captured (including definitional differences) and the period of observation.
Table E attempts to accommodate the latter issue, adjusting the NINo and TIM (IPS)
numbers such that they – like the LFS and WRS data – also cover the period since
Accession. Following adjustment, the number of NINo applications and number of WRS
applicants are comparable at around 500,000. The LFS and TIM (IPS) data are much
lower than these, but again comparable with one another. The remaining differences
between the estimates reflect the groups of individuals covered and definitions employed.
The LFS and TIM data are designed to capture only those migrants who stay in the
country for an extended period of time – more than 6 months for the LFS and 12 months
for the IPS. In contrast, the NINo and WRS capture all migrants, including those that
might return home relatively quickly – or in some sense commute to the UK for work.
The broader ordering of the estimates also makes sense. The LFS micro-data suggest that
30,000 self-employed workers have come to the UK since Accession. This equates to the
gap between the adjusted number of NINo applications, which covers all workers, and
the number of WRS applicants, which are solely employees. In addition, we should also
expect the estimated number of A8 migrants from the LFS data to exceed the estimate
from the TIM(IPS), because the TIM(IPS) employs a more restrictive definition of a
migrant – a migrant is someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a
period of at least a year.
Having reconciled the differences as far as possible, it appears that 500,000 workers is
likely to be an upper estimate of the number of A8 migrants that could potentially be in
the UK in late 2006. The data also suggest that as many as half of the migrants that have
come to the UK have not stayed permanently.

1. The LFS numbers are different from those described earlier because they cover a different period and different group (those aged
16-64 versus 16+) of migrants.

It does seem that the extent of mis-measurement of the number of foreign workers from
the A8 is unlikely to have had any significant impact on the current measurement of the
ILO unemployment rate, or the claimant count, as the numbers of additional migrants
required to lower the unemployment rate by even 0.1% would involve impossibly large
numbers.18
There is another source of data on international migration that supports our findings.
Population data recently available from Eurostat (2006) suggest that there was no
substantial decline in the populations of any of the A8 countries, especially Poland,
between 2004 and 2005. As a proportion of the population, the greatest net outflows
have been from Lithuania (-0.60%) and Latvia (-0.55%). This is consistent with the
flows to the UK from the A8 being largely temporary in nature. The small emigration
numbers for the earliest period following accession are also consistent with that view,
presented in Table F.

18

Currently at the time of writing (December, 2006) there are 30,696,000 economically active and
1,711,000 unemployed giving an unemployment rate of 1,711/30,696=5.57%. For simplicity, let us assume
that there were actually 304,000 more, uncounted, employed migrants, without adding anything to the
unemployment numbers as few if any of them are unemployed anyway. Such an increase would only lower
the unemployment rate to (1,711/31,000)=5.52%. It seems implausible to believe that there is greater mismeasurement than this. To return the unemployment rate to its October 2005 level of 5.12% (1,554/30,312)
would require an increase in the workforce to 33,400,000, an increase of around three quarters of a million
uncounted workers, which seems unlikely.

4) Characteristics of new migrants
It is possible to use the various data sources described above to determine the
characteristics of new (defined here as post-2004, and used interchangeably with ‘recent’)
A8 migrants and how they compare with new migrants from non-A8 countries, older
migrants who arrived pre-2004, as well as the non-migrant population or natives.
a) Region
Table 6 shows the number of worker applications from the WRS that were approved by
region, with the largest numbers in the East of England followed by London. Also
included in the final column of the table is the regional distribution of the unemployment
increase of 263,000 that occurred over the twelve months to September 2006. The
correlation between the distribution of migrants and growth in unemployment is
relatively weak.

Table 7 shows the distribution of all migrants by region using data on National Insurance
numbers. The table presents numbers registering in 2002-03 and 2005-06 as well as the
overall distribution of the migrants themselves alongside the distribution of the 16+
population. The next to last column reports the number of migrants registering in 200506 as a proportion of the 16+ population in 2006Q2. As was the case with the WRS, the
distribution of migrants is only weakly related to the change in unemployment observed
over the last year and reported in the final column of the table. It is apparent that
registrations of new migrants have increased in all regions, although the numbers are
especially high in London and the South East. London and the South East account for
approximately 48% of registrations for National Insurance numbers, but only 26% of the
11

16+ population. Table 8a uses regression estimation techniques and the LFS micro-data
to confirm the importance of migrants in London and the South East.
It appears that the effects of A8 immigration would likely be felt most in the South East
and least in the rest of the country. The question down the road is whether future waves
of immigrants will move outside London, to areas, such as Scotland, which have lower
unemployment and a declining and aging population.19
b) Occupation
Table 9 reports the distribution of A8 migrants by the top twenty occupations over time
from the WRS. The largest occupation is Process operative (Other Factory Worker). As
noted by Saleheen and Shadforth (2006), the dominant occupations are less skilled.
Interestingly, though, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of A8
workers in the WRS classified as being in Administration, Business and Management.
The majority of workers in the Administration, Business & Management occupation
group work for recruitment agencies and could be employed in a variety of occupations,
and on a temporary basis. In 2004 (May-December), 24.8% of registered workers were
in this category, compared with 36.3% in 2005 and 34.8% in the first three quarters of
2006. Consistent with this finding, Table 8b suggests that approximately one in five new
A8 immigrants are in temporary jobs.
c) Industry
From Table 8b it is apparent that the A8 migrants are more likely to be migrants in
Manufacturing, Distribution, Hotels and Restaurants and Construction than non-A8
migrants or natives. Non-A8 migrants are more likely to be in the public sector –
especially as nurses and carers - confirmed by work permits data (Table 10).
d) Schooling
Table 8a suggests that a high proportion of the new A8 migrants have a qualification,
confirming the findings in Saleheen and Shadforth (2006). The LFS classifies foreign
qualifications simply as ‘other’, so the level of these qualifications remains unclear.
e) Age and gender
The proportion of workers who register on the WRS who are young is particularly high
and has changed little over time. Of those who applied between May 2004 and
September 2006, 82% were aged 18-34 and 43% were aged 18-24. The male: female
ratio was 58:42. Confirming the evidence in the WRS that A8 migrants are
disproportionately young and male, 36.3% of applicants for NINos were aged 18-24 in
2005/6, and 44.9% were aged 25-34. The male: female ratio was 54:46. Saleheen and
Shadforth (2006) found from the 2005 LFS that recent A8 immigrants are also younger,
more likely to be male and single than other recent immigrants or than the indigenous
population. Drinkwater et al (2006) found similar results. This is confirmed in the more
recent data used here which pools 2004-2006Q3 to ensure larger sample sizes. A8
immigrants were on average 28 years of age compared with 30 years for recent non-A8
19

See Bell and Blanchflower (2007)

12

immigrants (Table 8a). They were also disproportionately male (59.1% for A8s and
48.4% non-A8s) and single (54.2% for A8s and 51.4% for non-A8s).
These data fit with other information available from a Candidate Eurobarometer Survey
conducted by the European Commission in April 2001, which considered the migration
intentions of A10 (A8 plus Cyprus and Malta) residents well before the borders opened in
May 2004. Respondents in the A10, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, were asked “do
you intend to go and live and work – for a few months or several years – in a current EU
country in the next five years?”.20 Obviously, one cannot assume that everyone who
expresses an interest in migration will actually migrate, but it turns out that there are
patterns in the data consistent with the actual flows to the UK. Table 11 reports the
results of estimating the probability of an individual responding in the affirmative to the
above question.21 Column 1 includes controls for age, gender, schooling, labour market
status and marital status and country dummies, with the excluded country being Malta.
Probabilities of ‘intending to move’ were especially high in Lithuania and Poland, which,
as we noted above, have been the two main source countries of A8 workers to the UK.
Column 1 suggests that intentions to move were higher for men, the young, the most
educated, unmarried or divorced, the unemployed, students and professionals.
Respondents in the survey were also asked “how willing would you be to live in another
European country where the language is different from your mother tongue?” Possible
answers were ‘not at all; not much; to some extent; very much’. Column 2 reports the
results of estimating an ordered logit where the dependent variable is set to one if not at
all, 2=not much etc. with the same controls as in column 1. The patterns revealed in
column 2 are very similar to those in column 1 – the probability of being willing to move
is higher among the young; men; the unmarried and divorced; the most educated;
professionals and business proprietors; those from Latvia and Poland, but also now
Slovakia. These equations seem highly consistent with the characteristics of the migrants
outlined above – intentions appear to be highly correlated with subsequent actions.
Interestingly, the World Bank (2007) addressed the issue of the mobility of the young in
its recent World Development Report. They found that the propensity to migrate
increases over the teenage years peaking in the early twenties in many destination
countries, such as Spain and the United States. Hence, young people make up a higher
proportion of the flow of international migrants than the stock. Young people are likely to
face lower costs of moving and have higher lifetime returns. The World Bank notes that
when the only legal options for the young are through high-skilled immigration,
categories requiring tertiary education or substantial job experience, migrants are less
likely to be young. They also conducted a survey of youths aged 15-24 in seven
developing countries (Albania, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Iraq, Malaysia, Romania and

Very high proportions said they would like to move, especially in Romania and Albania,
but the vast majority of those who wanted to move expressed a desire to migrate for only
a short period allowing them to save money to buy a house, open a business, or achieve
other goals in their home countries (World Bank (2007) chapter 8 figure 8.5).23
There is other evidence suggesting that there is often significant return migration. For
example, LaLonde and Topel (1997) found that 4.8 million of the 15.7 million US
immigrants who arrived between 1907 and 1957 had departed by the latter year.
Chiswick and Hatton (2003) pointed out that return migration exceeded immigration to
the United States during the 1930s. Yang (2006) recently examined the economics of
return migration for temporary labour migration by Filipinos. Yang found that, on
average, a 10% improvement in the exchange rate reduced the 12-month migrant return
rate by 1.4 percentage points. This is a large effect, amounting to nearly one-fifth of the
mean 12-month return rate in his sample.

22

We thank David McKenzie at the World Bank for providing us with these data.

23

In both Romania and Albania over 90% of males expressed a desire to move, but only around 20% of the
total said they wanted to move permanently.

14

f) Unemployment
There is little or no evidence to suggest that that the new A8 migrants have come to the
UK to claim or receive benefits: they have come to work. A8 workers, who are
registered under the WRS, have a right to reside and are entitled to in-work benefits such
as housing benefit and council tax benefit. If they are in part-time work of less than 15
hours per week they can qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance. If they lose their job they
lose their worker status, but are able to remain in the UK to find another job. However,
they do not have access to the benefit system, although after 12 months of continuous
employment they can have access to the full range of benefits. Once someone has been
working for 12 months they can apply for a residence permit. The immigrants from the
A8 have generally not brought dependents with them, although 56,681 successful claims
for child benefit have been filed. By 2006Q3, only 353/2328 applications for income
support; 859/5154 applications for income based jobseekers allowance; 32/125
applications for state pension credit and 524 applications for homelessness assistance had
been allowed to proceed. There have only been 128 local authority lettings to A8
immigrants in England.24 However, there is some anecdotal evidence, particularly in
London, that A8 migrants presenting as homeless has become a significant problem.

As Hillier and Hayes note:
"(I)t is unlikely that large numbers of A8 citizens will uproot themselves
from their homes, come to the UK to work for at least a year in order to
secure a future life of state-funded living. First, there is the effort involved
in this, and we are presumably talking about people who are not prepared to
make much effort on most fronts. Second, there is the standard of living
involved. Would life on state benefits in the UK really be that much better
than life on a low income in Estonia? Well, it might be. But probably not
by enough to make it a worthwhile option for an otherwise idle person if
they had to work for at least a year – perhaps working on a farm on
minimum wages – to get it" (2006, p.13).
As we show below, the influx of workers from the A8 appears to have had little or no
discernible effect on the unemployment rate or any other labour market aggregate for that
matter. It is plausible of course, that an influx of immigrants could displace natives or
less recent immigrants, and this is an issue we discuss further below. The large literature
on the issue suggests that this is unlikely to have been very important.
That being said, LFS data in Table 8b suggests that the unemployment rates for recent A8
immigrants are higher than for natives. For example, the native unemployment rate for
men is 5.1%, compared with 6.8% for recent A8 migrants and is even higher for recent
non-A8 migrants. The story is similar for females. As we will show below, the higher
unemployment rates for A8 migrants arise in large part because of differences in age,
which need to be controlled for.

Table 12 reports the results of estimating the probability of a randomly selected
individual being unemployed, conditional on their characteristics, where the dependent
variable is set to zero if employed and one if unemployed, using data from the LFS. A
dprobit is estimated as previously.21 The data used in the first three columns is for 20042006Q3, while the final column is for 2000-2003, and for both year groupings the sample
is restricted to those of working age (16-64). In columns 1-3 an immigration dummy is
included along with two dummies to identify recent A8 and recent non-A8 immigrants,
where 'recent' means post-2004. Two year dummies are also included. The result from
Table 8 is replicated here; recent immigrants have higher probabilities of being
unemployed than natives or immigrants that arrived pre-2004. Adding five age dummies
in column 2 changes the sign of the A8 since 2004 dummy, and the coefficient is
significant at conventional levels. The 'other since 2004' dummy and the immigration
dummies remain significant and positive.
The main reason for the higher observed rates of unemployment among recent A8
immigrants in the LFS arises because these migrants are relatively young. Column three
of Table 12 adds additional controls for schooling, gender, race and location. Both the
immigrant and ‘other since 2004’ dummies are now insignificant, but the 'A8 since 2004'
remains significant and positive. Including the immigrant dummy on its own without
either of the recent immigrant terms results in it being insignificant, which is in direct
contrast to the findings for the period 2000-2003 when it is significant and positive. The
equations in columns 3 and 4 are strikingly similar. Perhaps the most striking differences
over time are the rise in the size of the Inner London coefficient and the decline in the
size of the male coefficient, suggesting the gender gap in unemployment has narrowed.
Probabilities of being unemployed in both year groupings are higher for men, the young,
blacks and Asians, the least educated and for those living in Tyne and Wear. The positive
and significant 2006 dummies in columns 1-3 show that unemployment is significantly
higher in 2006 than it was in 2004. The significant negative dummies for 2001-2003
show that unemployment was significantly higher in 2000.
g) Wages
Table 13 reports the results of estimating five log hourly wage equations using data from
the 2004-2006 LFS. They follow the same structure as in Blanchflower and Oswald
(1994a, 1994b). Each equation includes a set of year dummies; race controls are added in
column 2; schooling dummies in column 3; region of work, workforce size and industry
dummies in column 4. Column 5 then adds controls for recent A8 and non-A8
immigrants. Adding controls has an impact – some of the difference in wages across
groups depends on characteristics particularly schooling, region and industry.
Immigrants earn 5% higher wages than non-immigrants without controls and 3% with
them. A8 immigrants earn approximately 14% less (column 4) than non-immigrants.
Recent A8 immigrants earn 18% less than non-immigrants; 20% less than non-A8
immigrants, whether recent or not. Recent A8 immigrants are relatively low paid.25
25

Drinkwater et al (2006) found from an analysis of wages in the Labour Force Surveys of 2001-2006,
that Poles had lower rates of return to their human capital than other recent migrants, even after controlling
for other personal and job-related characteristics.

16

h) Self-employment
It is appropriate to examine the incidence of (self-reported) self-employment among A8
migrants given that the self-employed do not have to register under the WRS, although
they do have to apply for a NINo, unless they work illegally in the black economy and
are paid cash in hand. Table 14 once again uses the LFS data file for 2004-2006Q3 to
estimate a dprobit, but here the sample is restricted to workers, with the dependent
variable set to one if self-employed and zero if a worker. The results are standard, in that
the probability of being self-employed is higher for men, Asians and Chinese, rises with
age and is especially high for those with a trade.26 It is low for blacks and those under
eighteen and for those with an HND, teaching or nursing qualification only. Immigrants
have a higher probability of being self-employed; A8 immigrants who arrived pre-2004
have a particularly high probability (column 1), but recent immigrants have lower
probabilities. As we move to the right controls are added. Column 5 adds 21 region of
work dummies and 60 industry dummies that result in recent non-A8 immigrants having
lower self-employment rates than natives (1.7 percentage points lower), while pre-2004
A8 migrants have much higher probabilities (12.0 percentage points higher). Recent A8
migrants have significantly higher self-employment rates than natives (5.5 percentage
points higher than non-immigrants), holding constant characteristics.

Interestingly, a number of recent Flash Eurobarometers have been carried out for a
number of countries on behalf of the European Commission, over the period 2000-2004,
on the topic of Entrepreneurship.27 The list of countries includes the 25 members of the
EU including the A8 plus the USA, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. Workers in these
countries were asked if “it is difficult to start one’s own business due to a lack of
financial support?” Table 15 ranks countries according to their answers to this question
based on the proportion saying they ‘strongly agreed’ (n=32,606). Column 2 is the
proportion who strongly agreed that “it is difficult to start one’s own business due to the
complex administrative procedures?”28 Respondents in these countries were also asked
“suppose you could choose between different kinds of jobs. Which one would you prefer
– being an employee or being self-employed?”29 Column 3 tabulates the proportion
saying they would like to be self-employed. It is apparent from the Table that there is a
desire for self-employment in the A8 countries as well as a perceived lack of financial
support alongside complex administrative procedures that make it hard to set up in
business. It is well known in the literature that capital constraints have a major impact on
the ability to become and remain self-employed (Blanchflower and Oswald (1998;
Blanchflower, 2000, 2004). These factors will likely contribute to a desire to come to the
UK, where these circumstances may appear less prevalent.

In both of the questions used in columns 1 and 2 possible responses were strongly agree, agree, disagree,
strongly disagree.

This was the same question used in Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer (2001) using data from the
1997/1998 International Social Survey Programme.

17

In summary, holding constant a variety of characteristics including age, qualifications and
location, recent A8 immigrants have higher self-employment rates and lower wages than
natives, but similar unemployment rates. In contrast, recent non-A8 migrants have a
higher probability of being unemployed, comparable wages and lower self-employment
rates than natives. A8 migrants who arrived before 2004 have very low unemployment
rates and high self-employment rates, but lower wage rates than natives.
5) Review of the empirical evidence on the impact of immigration flows on natives
A big issue we need to confront is the extent to which the new wave of immigrants has
impacted the UK labour market. The literature, from across many countries suggests that
impacts of immigration on non-immigrant employment and unemployment outcomes are
minimal, but there is some evidence of wage effects.
“Despite the popular belief that immigrants have a large adverse impact on
the wages and employment opportunities of the native-born population, the
literature on this question does not provide much support for this
conclusion…There is no evidence of economically significant reductions in
native employment. Most empirical analysis of the United States and other
countries finds that a 10 per cent increase in the fraction of immigrants in
the population reduces native wages by at most 1 percent. Even those
natives who should be the closest substitutes with immigrant labour have not
been found to suffer significantly as a result of increased immigration”,
Friedberg and Hunt (1995, p.42)
Most of the studies relate to a one-off permanent movement of workers from one country
to another, rather than movements back and forth between countries as appears to be
happening in the UK. This is similar to (illegal) worker flows between Mexico and the
United States as well as legal flows between countries, such as India and a number of
Gulf states (eg the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait).
The empirical evidence from around the world suggests that, even when there have been
very large flows of migrants, which are greater in magnitude than the one’s the UK has
experienced from the A8, that there have been few if any measured impacts on native
outcomes. This is confirmed by a recent report by the European Commission (2006)
which concluded that “mobility flows between the EU-10 and the EU-15 are very limited
and are simply not large enough to affect the EU labour market in general” (2006, p.13).
The Commission concluded that migrants play a complementary role in the EU-15 labour
markets alleviating skills bottlenecks and contributing to long-term growth. Heinz and
Ward-Warmedinger (2006) drew similar conclusions, arguing that “migration of workers
from the new EU-10 did not crowd out national workers and had a positive impact on the
old EU-15 by alleviating labour market shortages in certain areas and supporting
increased employment” (2006, p. 26). The International Organization for Migration
(IOM) concluded that “in a wide variety of jobs in western Europe there is hardly any
direct competition between immigrants and local workers” (2005, p.168). The IOM went
on to conclude that “the economic gains from immigration are small, but positive, with
the benefits, however, invariably distributed unequally. Most gains accrue to the migrants
18

and owners of capital, and can have positive knock-on effects for global GDP levels. The
‘losers’ are often the local workers with similar skills to the migrants, but again the
overall losses seem minimal” (2005, p. 19).
Longhi et al (2005) recently performed a meta-analysis of 348 estimates of the percentage
change in the wage of native workers with respect to a 1 percentage point increase in the
ratio of immigrants over native workers. Studies were examined from the US, Germany,
the Netherlands, France, Norway, Austria, Israel and Australia. The authors concluded
that the overall impact was very small. “A 1 percentage point increase in the proportion
of immigrants in the labour force lowers wages across the investigated studies by only
0.119%” (2005, p.472).
Australian and Canadian studies, for example, fail to show negative effects of
immigration on labour market outcomes (Addison and Worswick, 2002; Pope and
Withers (1993); Akbari and DeVoretz, 1992). Constant (2005) also has a small effect for
France. Zorlu and Hartog (2005) examined the impact of immigration on native worker's
wages in the UK, the Netherlands and Norway and also found very small effects.
In the US, Altonji and Card (1991) found that a one percentage point increase in the
fraction of immigrants in the population reduced wages by 1.2% and did not affect
unemployment. Card, D. (2005) has noted that “although immigration has a strong effect
on the relative supplies of different skill groups, local labour market outcomes of low
skilled natives are not much affected by these relative supply shocks” and later “overall
evidence that immigrants have harmed the opportunities of less skilled natives is scant.”
Evidence of a small negative wage effect is also found in Friedberg and Hunt (1995),
Borjas (1999) and Card and Lewis (2005).
More recently, Borjas (2003, 2006) and Borjas and Katz (2005) have argued that the
negative impacts are large. They used national data from five censuses to show that US
workers lost on average about 3% of the real value of their wages because of immigration
over the period 1980-2000, and that this loss reached 9% for high school dropouts.
Ottaviano and Peri (2005, 2006), however, using a general equilibrium approach, find
that overall immigration from 1990-2004 has generated a large positive impact on the
average wages of the US born, primarily because they find that US and foreign born
workers belong to different skill groups. The least educated also suffer smaller losses
than previously calculated.
Cortes (2005) found that low-skilled immigration benefits the native population by
decreasing the non-traded-goods component of the cost of living. A 10 percent increase
in the average city's share of immigrants decreases the price of immigrant intensive
services, such as housekeeping and gardening, by 1.3 percent with wages being the likely
channel: Cortes found such an increase lowers the wages of low-skilled natives by 0.6
percent and low-skilled immigrants by 8 percent. Cortes found that low-skilled
immigration “brings positive benefits to the US economy, but generates a redistribution
of wealth; it reduces the real income of low-skilled natives and raises the real income of
high-skilled natives.”

19

Dustman et al (2005) examined the way immigration impacted native outcomes in the
UK using data from the 1983-2000 Labour Force Surveys. They used pooled data for
eighteen years across seventeen regions (n=306) but, because of data availability, for the
period 1992-2000 for wages. Empirically they estimated a series of regressions with the
immigrant-native ratio as a control. Their main findings were that there was little
evidence of any adverse outcomes for natives on wages, employment or unemployment,
consistent with the findings for the US and elsewhere. If there was evidence of any
adverse outcomes it was limited to those with intermediate levels of education. An
increase in immigration, amounting to one per cent of the native population in their
preferred IV specification, would lead to a decrease of 0.07 percentage points in the
native employment rate, but this was not significant at conventional levels. IV is
necessary because immigrant shares and immigrant outcomes may be spatially correlated
because of common fixed influences. Furthermore, the authors found no evidence of any
significant effects on wages, unemployment or participation using their IV specification.
Hatton and Tani (2005) also find modest wage and employment effects in the UK, but
also find evidence of negative correlations between immigration from abroad to a region
and in-migration from other regions. These are only significant in southern regions
where immigration of foreign citizens is concentrated. The authors suggest that this is an
important mechanism through which the British labour market adjusts. Frijters et al.
(2005) find that immigrant job search is less successful than that of natives; immigrants
are as likely to gain employment through informal methods as via verifiable routes; the
probability of success increases with years since migration. The finding that immigrants
do not effectively compete for jobs may thus help explain why immigration has little
impact on native employment.
Manacorda et al (2006) find evidence that natives and immigrants in the UK are
imperfect substitutes, like Ottaviano and Peri (2005, 2006) for the US. They find that a
10% rise in the share of immigrants increases native-migrant male wage differentials by
2%. This acts to attenuate any effect of increased labor supply on the native wage
distribution and then only has a sizeable effect on wages of migrants who were already in
the UK. It also helps explain the findings of Dustman et al (2005) and others that the
wage impact of immigration on natives is small.
Gilpin et al (2006) recently conducted a careful econometric analysis of the impact of the
new A8 migrants. In particular they focussed on their impact on the claimant count, as
this is not a sample. They found that:
“despite anecdotal evidence, there is no discernible statistical evidence
which supports the view that the inflow of A8 migrants is contributing to a
rise in claimant unemployment in the UK” (2006, p.49).
There have been a number of papers that have examined major flows of immigrants into a
country using natural experiments. The opening of the UK to A8 immigrants is directly
comparable to these exogenous supply shocks to the various labour markets. These
include the Mariel boatlift into the US from Cuba in 1980 as well as from Algeria to
France in 1962 after independence; Jews to Israel from the Soviet Union between 1990
and 1994; to Portugal from Mozambique and Angola in the mid 1970s; to several
20

European countries as a result of the Balkan Wars in the late 1980s and early 1990s; into
Austria especially from the former Yugoslavia, and finally to Germany between 1985 and
1989, particularly from Turkey. The evidence from these studies is remarkably
consistent – these immigrant flows have had little or no significant/substantive impact on
any native outcomes. There is a reason to believe that the scale of any impact from these
experiments would be greater than that from the A8 in the UK, as in most cases the scale
of the influx was greater, and in many cases, there was no potential return of the migrants
to their country of origin as is occurring in the UK.
a) USA
On April 20th 1980 Fidel Castro declared that Cuban nationals wishing to go to the US
could leave freely from the port of Mariel, and approximately 125,000 did. Card (1990)
found that wages and employment opportunities for Miami's population were hardly
impacted at all by the boatlift. The trends observed in Miami were comparable to those
in other cities such as Atlanta, Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles that did not experience
the Mariel flow. In fact the wages of unskilled black workers rose relative to wages in
the four comparison cities. Similarly, the unemployment rate among low-skilled blacks
improved. Among Hispanics there was an increase in Miami's unemployment rate
relative to that in the other cities in 1981, but from 1982-1985 the Hispanic
unemployment rate in Miami fell faster than in the comparison cities. It does appear
though that some residents left Miami in response to Mariel and other migrants went
elsewhere; the rate of Miami's population growth after 1980 slowed considerably relative
to the rest of Florida.
b) France
Hunt (1992) examined the impact of the arrival of 900,000 people of European origin
returning to France within one year following the independence of Algeria in 1962,
which increased France’s labour force by 2%. Hunt found that, despite the fact that the
repatriates had high unemployment rates themselves, there was no evidence that this flow
of migrants had any sizable impact on unemployment of non-repatriates. A one
percentage point higher proportion of repatriates implied an increase in non-repatriate
unemployment of at most 0.2 percentage points. There was also weak evidence on the
impact on wages – a one percentage point higher proportion of repatriates was associated
with 0.8% lower wages. The labour-force participation of non-repatriates was unaffected
by the presence of the repatriates.
c) Portugal
Carrington and deLima (1996) found that when the African colonies of Mozambique and
Angola became independent of Portuguese colonial control in the mid 1970s,
approximately 600,000 people returned to Portugal, increasing its population by
approximately 7%. The returnados, who were at least as skilled as Portuguese natives,
“had only a modest effect on the Portuguese labour market” (1996, p.341). Comparisons
with Spain and France suggested that any adverse impacts were quantitatively swamped
by the European-wide downturn in labour market conditions in the 1970s. Comparisons
across districts within Portugal showed that those with a higher proportion of immigrants
did have lower wage growth, but because of the timing and persistence of the wage
effects there are questions about whether the returnados were the cause of the wage
downturn.

21

d) Israel
Immigration increased Israel's population by 12 percent between 1990 and 1994 after
immigration restrictions were lifted in the Soviet Union, increasing the population by
over 7 percent in two years. Friedberg (2001) examined the impact of this rapid influx of
workers. She found that following the influx occupations that employed more
immigrants had substantially lower native wage growth and slightly lower native
employment growth. Using OLS she found that a 10 percent increase in occupational
employment because of immigration was associated with a 3-6 percent decline in the real
earnings of natives in that occupation. However, because the immigrants' post-migration
occupational distribution is influenced by relative labor market conditions across
occupations, OLS estimates are biased. Using IV, with previous occupation as the
instrument, Friedberg found no adverse impact of immigration on any native outcomes
including wages and employment of natives.
e) Germany
Pischke and Velling (1997) examined the impact of the influx of foreign workers into
Germany between 1985 and 1989, particularly from Turkey, on employment and
unemployment rates. Between these two years the share of Turks in the population rose
from 1.6% to 1.9%, while the foreign share of the population rose from 4.9% to 5.6%.
Their results “consistently show that there is little evidence for displacement effects due
to immigration (p. 603).” This is consistent with the findings of Mühleisen and
Zimmermann (1994), who also found negligible impacts of foreign labour on
unemployment in Germany.
f) Austria
Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1996, 1999) examined the impact of a dramatic rise in
the share of alien workers in Austria as a result of the breakdown of the former
communist regimes, especially from former Yugoslavia. Between 1988 and 1991 the
foreign share of employment in Austria increased from 5.4% to 9.0%. Winter-Ebmer and
Zweimüller (1999) find only a modest impact of immigration on the unemployment risk
for native workers under the age of 35. Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1996) found
negligible or even positive wage effects.
g) Europe
Angrist and Kugler (2003) use the Balkan Wars as a Mariel-boatlift style immigration
experiment to examine the impact of immigration in the European Economic Area for
1983-1999. There was very little change in immigration flow until 1988, but the late
1980s and early 1990s saw a marked upturn. The increases were greatest for Germany,
beginning in 1989 and later in Finland, France and Sweden. The flow from Yugoslavia
was particularly important after 1990. Angrist and Kugler (2003) found that an increase
in the foreign share of 10% would reduce native employment rates by 0.2-0.7 percentage
points. There was also some evidence that the impact of the foreign share on the
employment of native men was greatest in countries with less flexible labour markets,
higher replacement rates and higher entry costs. The estimates typically imply more
native job losses in countries with less flexible labour and product markets.

22

The empirical evidence from around the world suggests that, even when there have been
very large flows of migrants, which are greater in magnitude than the one’s the UK has
experienced from the A8, that there have been few, if any, measured impacts on native
outcomes.
6) The macro-economic policy consequences of A8 migration
a) Immigration and inflation
The Monetary Policy Committee is interested in immigration to the extent that it affects
inflation and growth in the medium term. The purpose of this section is to bring together
the findings reported earlier in this paper to make a judgement about the prospects for
growth and inflation in the near term, as we see them at present.
The overall impact of immigration, including immigration from the A8 countries, on
inflation and growth is on its own not clear-cut – there is no automatic rule-of-thumb that
we can look to in order to determine the impact on the economy. This is because
immigrants are both consumers and workers/producers, and so immigration affects both
aggregate demand and aggregate supply. And it is the balance between demand and
supply (sometimes called the output gap) that determines inflation. So the MPC needs to
take a judgement about whether immigration has added more to supply or to demand in
recent years. We look at each of these in turn.
In thinking about the supply potential of the economy, most people would probably agree
that extra (immigrant) workers in the economy would raise the supply potential of the
economy. But the extent to which aggregate supply increases will depend on the
economic characteristics of immigrants relative to native workers. A recent survey of
contacts of the Bank of England’s regional Agents suggested that the new A8 migrants
were highly productive. This is consistent with the findings of a Home Office Study on
the use of migrant labour that concluded as follows.
“Employers cited advantages of migrant workers in terms of their general
attitude and work ethic. They tended to be more motivated, reliable and
committed than domestic workers. For example, migrants were said to be
more likely to: demonstrate lower turnover and absenteeism; be prepared
to work longer and flexible hours; be satisfied with their duties and hours
of work; and work harder in terms of productivity and speed. In the view
of some employers, the more favourable work ethic of migrant workers
encouraged domestic workers to work harder.” (Dench, 2006)

In Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) it was argued that immigration of higher skilled (or
more productive) workers could temporarily raise the domestic rate of productivity
growth; and that immigrant labour could lower the natural rate of unemployment, either
by filling skill gaps (assuming that foreign-born workers are complementary to the
domestic workforce) or by tempering wage demands, as wage bargainers become aware
that they can be replaced more easily than in the past. In support of the latter argument,
the OECD Economic Outlook (2006b) notes that “international as well as UK evidence
23

suggests [that] immigration can serve to make the labour market as a whole more fluid
and wages less sensitive to demand fluctuations.” Katz and Krueger (1999) argue that
recruitment agencies for temporary workers have also contributed to declines in the
natural rate. Shimer (1998) argues that time series changes in the natural rate of
unemployment in the US are driven by demographic changes; the declining natural rate
of unemployment over the last decade or so has resulted from declines in the proportion
of individuals in the population that had high propensities for unemployment. So the
aging of the baby boom generation was particularly important as the proportion of the
population that was young – and subject to high unemployment rates – declined over
time. The analogy for the UK is that the workforce has increased in size as a result of
adding a group – the A8 – with a relatively low propensity to be unemployed and to claim
benefits. The workforce appears more flexible and mobile than it was before the entry of
workers from the A8.30 They had no entitlement to benefits so the replacement rate in the
economy has fallen, once again lowering the natural rate of unemployment. These A8
migrants have likely reduced the natural rate through their impact on the wage bargaining
process, lowering the bargaining power of native workers. The ‘fear’ of unemployment
has risen (Blanchflower, 1991).
In thinking about aggregate demand, most people would agree that immigrants are extra
consumers and that they raise aggregate consumption demand. It is likely that
immigrants spend a lower fraction of their income when compared to domestic workers,
perhaps because they send remittances back home or spend less on durable goods while
temporarily resident in the UK – this would, on its own, suggest that immigrants raise
demand by less than they raise supply.31 However, the funds that migrants send home
might be recycled back to the UK through greater export demand, and UK consumers
might also benefit from lower prices as a result of the extra productivity of migrants.
Aggregate demand might also rise because of increased investment. The theoretical
argument here is that firms require both labour and capital to produce their output.
Immigration gives them more labour, and firms may wish to supplement this with more
capital. But the extent to which investment rises, and how quickly, will depend on the
skills of immigrants and the technologies of firms. If firms are able to substitute between
labour and capital, then there may be a smaller impact on investment than might
otherwise be the case. Early work by Welch (1969), Griliches (1970) and Berndt and
Christensen (1974) all suggested that physical capital is more complementary with skilled
than with unskilled labour. More recently, Lewis (2006) found that US cities with a larger
share of migrant labour are also the ones with less capital intensive production
technologies.

30

Borjas (2001) argues that immigration “greases the wheels of the labor market by injecting into the
economy a group of persons who are very responsive to regional differences in economic opportunities”
(2001, p.2). This has the effect of improving labour market efficiency and hence leads to a more efficient
allocation of national resources.

31

Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) show that according to IPS data, most immigrants intend to stay in the
United Kingdom for a maximum of four years.

24

On balance we would suggest that at present it appears that recent A8 immigration has
acted to reduce the natural rate of unemployment in the UK and raised the supply
potential of the economy. But it also seems that recent immigration is likely to have
raised potential supply by more than it has raised demand, and thereby has acted to
reduce inflationary pressures. This argument holds for three reasons. First, the
consumption behaviour of native workers may have been affected by the increased ‘fear’
of unemployment resulting from a more flexible labour market. Second, the recycling of
remitted funds back to the UK is unlikely to be perfect. Third, firms may able to
substitute between capital and labour, offsetting some of the potential for investment
spending to rise.
Is the recent rise in the unemployment rate structural?
While we currently believe that immigration on its own is likely to have reduced the
natural rate of unemployment and inflationary pressures in the past few years, there are
off-setting forces that may have pushed the natural rate back up more recently. In
particular, developments in the labour market over the past year, such as the up-rating of
the national minimum wage (NMW) and the rising participation of older workers could
have, ceteris paribus, raised the natural rate, with corresponding implications for inflation
and growth prospects going forward.
A key question surrounding these prospects is how to interpret the recent rise in the actual
unemployment rate. If it has occurred without a rise in the natural rate of unemployment
then one might conclude that there is more slack in the labour market relative to the past,
and continued immigration is likely to keep inflationary pressures down in the future.
But, if the natural rate has risen then there is more uncertainty about whether spare
capacity has risen over the past year.
Why might the natural rate of unemployment have risen? In the section on the
characteristics of immigrants we found that immigrants are more likely to be young, and
that the pay of new immigrants (including those from the A8 countries) is lower than that
of previous immigrants and UK-born workers. Given this, a rise in labour supply via
immigration will mean that there will be a larger fraction of young workers in the
economy who have a higher probability of unemployment. This change to the
demographic mix of the population may raise the natural rate.32 Similarly the increased
participation of older workers may also have raised the natural rate of unemployment if
they have displaced younger workers. Or, if the level of the NMW is set at rate that is
higher than the level at which local labour markets would otherwise clear, this will tend
to lower the demand for labour and raise the natural rate of unemployment. The rise in
the NMW, coupled with the fact immigrant workers tend to earn less – and so are likely
to benefit from the rise in the NMW – could also lead to a rise in the natural rate of
32

Shimer (1998) finds that demographic changes – such as shifts in the labour force to groups with
different propensities to being unemployed – are important determinants of the natural rate. He argues that
changes in demographics can explain the bulk of the decline in the NAIRU and seems to fit very closely
with Staiger, Stock and Watson's (1997) estimate of the NAIRU, except during the Vietnam war.

25

unemployment. These changes could more than cancel out any declines from A8
immigration outlined above.
The challenge for policy makers is that it is very difficult to obtain an accurate estimate
of the natural rate of unemployment, particularly in real time. But policy makers need to
take a judgment about the degree of spare capacity in the economy, and that requires
some judgment about the natural rate of unemployment. For that reason we investigate
whether the recent rise in unemployment is related to the three structural changes outlined
above: the rise in immigration; the participation of older workers; and, the up-rating of
the NMW. If it is, then one might argue that the rise in the unemployment rate has been
accompanied by a rise in the natural rate of unemployment. This analysis exploits the
regional variation in each of these factors, but is unable to provide conclusive evidence of
any change.
First, has the recent rise in unemployment been highest in regions which have seen the
largest increase in immigration? Chart 3 shows new immigrants – those arriving since
the start of 2004 – are more likely to settle, at least initially, in London than elsewhere.
Chart 4 shows the change in the share of new immigrants going to each region. The fact
that London is negative means that a smaller share of immigrants settled in London in
2006, compared to 2005. The regions that have seen a falling share of migrants are
London, the East, North East, North West, Yorkshire & Humber and Wales: three (Y&H,
NE & London) out of these six regions have also seen some of the largest increases in
their unemployment rates (Chart 5). But, Chart 6 shows the opposite of what we might
have expected; regions with the biggest increases in immigration have tended to see the
smallest rises in their unemployment rates.33, 34 Of course, this is consistent with the
possibility that foreign workers are attracted to those regions where the unemployment
rate is lowest and opportunities are greatest, for which there appears to be some evidence
(Chart 7).

33

Note that the negative correlation shown in Chart 6 is not statistically significant. A regression of the
change in the total unemployment rate (between 2005q3 and 2006q3) on the change in the share of new
immigrants (between 2005 and 2006) gives a t-statistic of -1.02.

34

We look at changes in the regional share of immigrants in charts 6, 9 and 12. One might consider
weighting the shares to reflect the number of employees in each region as a bigger effect might be expected
in regions which have received more migrants. However, WRS data suggest that while most migrants
settle in London and the South East, the ratio of A8 migrants to the current population by region is broadly
the same nationwide, at around 1:67.

However, we know that most immigrants are young (43% of workers on the WRS are
aged 18-24), and that the most recent rise in the aggregate unemployment rate has been
driven by an increase in youth unemployment. In fact, the proportion of total
unemployment accounted for by 18-24 year olds has been rising steadily, from 24.3% of
the total in 2000, to 30.7% in 2006Q3.35 So what about the possibility that the influx of
migrants has increased the youth unemployment rate?
Chart 8 shows regions with the largest increases in total unemployment were not
necessarily regions with the largest increases in youth unemployment. Chart 9 shows that
there is only a weakly positive (but statistically insignificant) relationship between those
regions that have witnessed the largest increases in youth unemployment and those that
have seen the biggest influxes of new immigrants. So it seems that the increase in the
unemployment rate of 18-24 year olds has had relatively little to do with the influx of
migrants.

What about the possibility that the increased participation of older workers has displaced
younger workers? The horizontal axis in Chart 10 plots the change in the activity rates of
workers above state pension age36 between 2005Q3 and 2006Q3 for all regions in the
UK. Activity rates among older workers have increased in all regions, but there appears
to be no correlation between the increased activity rates of older workers and the
increased unemployment rates of youth workers at a regional level. The outlier
observation on the bottom right of the chart is Wales.

Can the rising NMW explain the increase in the unemployment rate? There may be
something in this, especially given the most recent increases in the NMW on October 1st
2006: from £5.05 to £5.35 (5.9%) for those aged over 22; from £4.25 to £4.45 (4.7%) for
18-21 year olds; and from £3 to £3.30 (10.0%) for 16-17 year olds.37
The minimum wage is set nationwide in nominal terms and hence its real level varies
markedly by region; its real value is much higher outside London and the South East and
that is where it is expected to bite (Stewart, 2002), because it will enter at a higher point
on the wage distribution. The minimum is also most likely to bind for unskilled 22-24
year olds who are paid adult rates and 18 year olds who jump from the 16-17 year olds’
rate.
Chart 11 shows how two of the NMW rates compare to wages at the bottom end (10th
percentile) of the wage distribution in each region using ASHE, and additionally for each
age group using the LFS micro-data. According to the data, the newly announced
minimum wages are likely to be a binding constraint for employers in all regions except
London and the South East for the over 22’s and in all regions for those aged 18-21.
Taking the LFS data at face value, it is possible that employers may respond to (or have
already responded to) the higher minimum wage rates by cutting back on employment. If
that were the case, then one might argue that the natural rate of unemployment may have
been pushed up recently.

Between April 1999 and October 2006 both the Adult and Development rates rose by approximately 48%
Earnings, as measured by the whole economy AEI, have risen by 35% between April 1999 and September
2006 both including and excluding bonus payments).

1. The chart excludes from the LFS data those earning less than
£1 per hour.

There are estimates from the Department of Trade and Industry of the number of workers
in each region who are likely to get a pay rise as a consequence of the recent rises in the
NMW.38 We compute a measure of the ‘share’ of workers in each region who will be
affected by the NMW by dividing this DTI estimate by the total number of employees in
each region. Against this we plot the change in youth unemployment (Chart 12). The
chart shows that regions hit most by the NMW are also the regions which have seen the
biggest rise in the youth unemployment rate, though the relationship is not statistically
significant.
Most studies39 have failed to find statistically significant evidence that the introduction of
the NMW, and past increases to it, have had adverse affects on the demand for labour and
employment. While it is too early to test the impact of the most recent increment, it is
clear that if the NMW continues to rise then eventually it will start to have an impact on
the amount of labour firms employ and the natural rate of unemployment.
In summary
Over the past eighteen months the unemployment rate has risen by 0.8 percentage points.
To find out whether this rise in unemployment has been related to structural factors we
have investigated whether regional changes in the unemployment rate have been
correlated with changes in the share of new immigrants, older worker activity rates or
estimates of the number of people that will benefit from rises in the NMW. We have

38

See Department of Trade and Industry (2006) Government evidence to the low pay commission on the
economic effects of the National Minimum Wage, Table F2)
39

See for example Dickens and Draca (2005) and Stewart (2002, 2004).

30

found that there are no significant relationships between any of these variables and the
rise in actual (and youth) unemployment rates across regions.
Of course, there may be other macro-economic factors that might have raised the natural
rate of unemployment, at least temporarily. Nickell (2006) has noted that the equilibrium
rate of unemployment will rise if workers attempt to sustain rates of real wage growth
when the rate consistent with stable employment shifts unexpectedly. If workers persist
in attempting to bargain for rates of real wage growth which take no account of the
movement in the terms of trade, this will tend to raise unemployment. Exactly the same
argument applies if there is an unexpected fall in trend productivity growth, perhaps
brought about by rises in oil prices or an increase in labour taxes. For example, if labour
taxes (payroll tax rates plus income tax rates plus consumption tax rates) go up, the real
post-tax consumption wage must fall if real labour costs per employee facing firms are
not to rise. Any resistance to this fall would lead to a rise in unemployment. To this
point there is no evidence of significant wage resistance or second round effects from the
recent oil shock; wage increases have remained benign, presumably in part because of the
dampening effect of the recent A8 migrant flow.
Our findings are not conclusive evidence, but they do suggest that the recent rise in the
unemployment rate is unrelated to structural factors. In other words, there is no evidence
from the labour market that the natural rate of unemployment has risen in the past year.
Policymakers may therefore interpret the rise in the actual unemployment rate as a
reflection of greater slack in the labour market now compared to a year ago, which is
likely to keep wage and inflationary pressures subdued in the near future.
Conclusion
UK population growth over the last thirty-five years has been remarkably low in
comparison with other countries; the population grew by just 7% between 1971 and 2004,
less than all the other EU15 countries (except Germany), Australia, Canada, Japan, New
Zealand and the United States, plus China and India. The rate of UK population growth
did exceed that of six countries from the former Soviet bloc (Czech Republic; Croatia;
Estonia; Hungary; Latvia and Bulgaria), but was below the rates of growth of Poland,
Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. This
recent growth has been driven primarily by changes in net migration. Both the inflow
and outflow migration rates have risen but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly, most
recently, with an influx of migrants from eight East European countries. However, the
increase in the net migration flow predates the influx of A8 migrants, reflecting a steady
rise in the number of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East too.
The propensity to migrate to the UK is higher the lower is GDP per capita in each of the
A8 countries. The decision is also strongly correlated with life satisfaction scores and
unemployment rates, but is uncorrelated with employment rates or rates of inflation.
There appears to be consistent evidence from the Worker Registration Scheme and
National Insurance Number applications that approximately 500,000 migrants from the
31

A8 countries had come to work in the UK between May 2004 and late 2006. But other
sources suggest a significant proportion of these workers – perhaps as many as a half have returned to their country of origin.
The empirical literature from around the world suggests little or no evidence that
immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes such as wages
and unemployment. Recent work by a number of other authors for the UK is also
consistent with this view.
The impact of recent migration from the A8 countries on the UK economy will be
determined by the extent to which immigrants add to supply relative to demand, since it
is the balance between these two factors that determines prospects for inflation. We
argue that at present it appears that A8 immigration has tended to increase supply by
more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run), and thereby acted to
reduce inflationary pressures.
There seems to be broad agreement that immigration is likely to have reduced the natural
rate of unemployment in the UK over the past few years. But there is some uncertainty
about what has happened to the natural rate in the very recent past and what might
happen to it in the near future. This is because immigration has not been the only shock
to affect the labour market very recently. This paper examines the relationship between
the rising unemployment rate and other structural developments across regions, but fails
to find any statistically significant relationships. It seems appropriate to conclude that the
natural rate of unemployment has probably not risen in the very recent past and that
recent immigration continues to suppress inflationary pressures.

Source: Over 500 migrants a day gained through migration to the UK, ONS, November 2006
Figures have been rounded independently and may not add to totals. Based mainly on data from the
International Passenger Survey. Includes adjustments for (1) those whose intended length of stay changes
so that their migrant status changes; (2) asylum seekers and their dependants not identified by the IPS; and
(3) flows between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Up to and including 2003, estimates are shown only
for the EU15 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden). From 2004, the estimates are also shown for A8
(the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and the EU25
(i.e. the EU15 and A8 groups, plus Malta and Cyprus). British citizens are excluded from all EU groupings
and are shown separately. Includes estimates of South African citizenship for all years. From 2004, the
New Commonwealth excludes Malta and Cyprus. Figures for all years include Hong Kong.

Notes: This table shows registered workers rather than the number of applications made. The figures are for
initial applications only (not multiple applications, where an individual is doing more than one job
simultaneously, nor re-registrations, where an individual has changed employers). The total shown for 2004 is
for the part year May to December. Data are from the Worker Registration Scheme.

Appendix A – Sources of Data on the numbers of individuals who have arrived in
the UK
1) Migrants from the A8 are obliged to register on the Home Office administered Worker
Registration Scheme (WRS) if they are employed in the UK for a month or more.
Nationals of the A8 countries who wish to take up employment in the UK for a period of
at least a month are generally required to register with the Home Office to work in the
UK. Workers who are self-employed do not need to register and are therefore not
included in these figures; there may also be other workers from the accession countries
who for one reason or another do not register and are thus also not included in these
figures. Failure to apply within one month of starting a job means the employment is
illegal.
There was a £50 charge (now raised to £70) for the first application. Individuals working
in the UK before May 2004 without permission must also register. After a year of
constant legal employment, migrants do not have to register on the WRS, instead they are
entitled to a residence permit which gives the holder the right to live and work in the UK.
The data from the WRS provided here are data on applicants to the scheme rather than
applications. Applicants must register more than once if they are employed by more than
one employer. They must also re-register if they change employer. Each application to
the WRS therefore represents one job, not one applicant. To avoid counting applicants
more than once, each applicant is represented only once in the data, with information
relating to the first job for which he/she registered. Workers from these accession
countries are generally required to have work continuously for 12 months before they are
entitled to income related benefits.40
2) International Passenger Survey (IPS) which is a voluntary survey of individuals
passing through the main UK air and sea ports and the Channel Tunnel. The IPS
questions 250,000 passengers annually of whom only 1% are migrants. The survey is
based on respondent's intended length of stay and includes questions on age, sex, marital
status, citizenship and country of last residence. The benefit of the IPS is that it provides
data on those who leave as well as those who enter the country making it possible to
measure net flows.

c) National Insurance number allocations to overseas nationals.41 NINos are required for
employment/self-employment purposes or to claim benefits and tax credits. The
Department of Work and Pensions is responsible for allocating NINos to overseas
nationals who apply to their local Jobcentre Plus office. An interview occurs and
documentation is examined which may include the use of ultra-violet lighting to ensure

passports and visas are genuine. The DWP Central Control Units corroborate the
evidence supplied a interview eg checking that an employer is genuine and has made a
job offer to an applicant. Once the NINo is allocated HMRC add the NINo onto the
National Insurance recording System (NIRS) which holds details of national insurance
contributions and income tax.
d) Work permits
Over the period 1995 to 2004 total approvals including work permits, first permissions,
extensions, changes of employment and supplementary employment increased by 326 per
cent, but was followed by a 7 percent fall in 2005 (Salt and Millar, 2006). The largest
annual increases were between 2000 and 2001 as a consequence of the IT boom. In terms
of the nationalities covered, out of 86,191 work permits and first permissions 33.9% were
for Indian nationals followed by 10.7% from the USA. This compares with 24,161
admitted in 1995 of which 8.3% were from India and 32.6% from the USA.

The employment of people who are subject to immigration control is regulated by the
granting of work permits. Under the 1971 Immigration Act a work permit is issued to a
specific employer for a named person for a specific job. A work permit has to be issued
for all foreign nationals who are not EEA citizens and who wish to work in the UK unless
they enter on another work-related scheme or have some other status (such as student)
where some work is allowed.42
There are five other categories of work permit application a) First Permission – this is
similar to the work permit but is granted for foreign workers who are already living in the
UK who do not already have a permit to work. b) In country extension – application from
an employer who wishes to extend the employment of an individual currently working for
them in the UK. c) In country change of employment – application from an employer
who wishes to employ an individual already in the UK who originally entered with a
work permit for a different employer or who wishes to engage an individual in other work
for the same employer. d) In country technical change – applications from employers
who wish to continue to engage an individual in the same job, but where minor details
have changed, such as the address the individual is working at, or if the individual or the
employer has changed their name. e) Work permit extension – extension applications
from employers to extend the employment of an individual who is out of the UK at the
time the application is considered. A8 nationals were covered by work permits are
included in figures prior to may 2004.
e) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a continuous household survey, which provides a
wide range of data on labour market statistics and related topics such as training,
qualifications, income and disability. The LFS has been running since Spring 1992 in its
present form, although a LFS has been carried out in Britain since 1973. Between 1973
and 1983, a biennial survey was carried out during the spring. In 1984, the survey
became annual. In Spring 1992, for the first time, the data were made available quarterly,

with a quarterly sample size approximately equivalent to that of the previous annual data,
thus becoming the Quarterly Labour Force Survey. Each quarter, interviews are achieved
at about 59,000 addresses with about 138,000 respondents. From January 2006 the LFS
moved to calendar quarters.
As noted by Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) the LFS relies on additional information
about the size and composition of the population – population weights – to produce an
estimate of the “true” immigrant population. The accuracy of the survey will also depend
on how representative the sample is of the population. For example, it might be the case
that immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants, are less likely to respond to the LFS
survey, so that they are underrepresented in the LFS data. Similarly, if immigrants,
particularly temporary immigrants, are less likely to live at private addresses and more
likely to live in communal establishments, such as guest houses or hotels, the LFS data
will not accurately reflect the size and characteristics of the immigrant population. Data
from the 2001 Census suggest that immigrants are more likely than UK-born individuals
to live in communal establishments. But just 1% of the total population lived in
communal establishments in 2001, suggesting that this is not a major problem, but there
is some uncertainty about whether the problem has worsened in more recent years.43

2% of the immigrant population lived in communal establishments in 2001.
