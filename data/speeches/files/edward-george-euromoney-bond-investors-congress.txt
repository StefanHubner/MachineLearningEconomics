EUROMONEY BOND INVESTORS’ CONGRESS
TUESDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2002

Thank you Padraic for that kind introduction and for honouring me with the
Euromoney Lifetime Achievement Award. It’s nice to be prompted to recall some of
the good times – and some of the not so good times in the course of my career at the
Bank of England which I think of not so much in terms of achievement but of lifelong
learning.
We’ve come a long way since 1962 – both nationally and internationally – from
different starting points certainly, and moving in fits and starts, at varying speeds and
to varying degrees, in a process of continuing, indeed accelerating, change. But
standing back and trying to look through the confusion of short-term events, I would
pick out three broad trends for comment this morning.
The first relates to macro-economic policy, where the earlier emphasis was very much
on short-term demand management designed to manage the perceived trade-off
between growth and employment, on the one hand, and inflation and a manageable
balance of payments position, on the other. Monetary policy was used in conjunction
with fiscal policy and supported with various forms of direct control to pump up
demand, when the economy declined and unemployment rose, until inflation and the
balance of payments threatened to get out of hand, at which point all the policy levers
were thrown into reverse. It was a recipe for short-termism throughout our
economies.
We gradually learned from experience – perhaps more slowly in this country than
some others – that there is no trade-off between growth and stability in the medium
and longer term, and that, in managing demand – which of course we continue to do –
we needed to pay far more attention to the underlying, supply-side, capacity of the
economy to meet that demand. We came to recognise that direct controls merely
addressed the symptoms of instability rather than its causes. We realised increasingly
that fiscal policy was not well suited to the task of short-term demand management,
and needed to be constrained within prudent limits if debt levels were to be
sustainable in the medium- and longer-term. And this left a more distinctive and
clearly defined role for monetary policy as the primary instrument for maintaining
broad balance consistently over time between aggregate demand and underlying
supply.
All this has become the accepted wisdom just about everywhere. “Stability is a
necessary condition for sustainable growth” has become the universal central-banking
credo – though that doesn’t necessarily make it any easier to achieve!
This emphasis on macro-economic stability - and sustainability - has served to focus
attention increasingly on the supply-side of our economies – on structural reform and
supply-side flexibility – as the key to raising the underlying rate of growth which our
economies can maintain. And that is the second general trend I’d like to touch upon.
It has meant increasing reliance upon free markets – again both nationally and
internationally – to allocate productive resources to where they can most effectively
contribute to meeting demand. The collapse of communism is a dramatic example,
but the promotion of free trade through the WTO and of the free movement of capital

3
through the IMF, or the spread of privatisation and deregulation all around the world,
not least in financial markets, can all be seen as aspects of essentially the same thing.
This emphasis on free markets cannot mean “anything goes”. Public policy concerns,
of course, remain; and we need to have rules to ensure that competition is fair as well
as free. But it does mean less centralised, bureaucratic, intervention telling people
what they may or may not do, leaving them much greater freedom to do what they
choose provided they meet the necessary nationally or internationally agreed
standards. The resulting intensification of competition can, of course, be
uncomfortable for existing producers – and can lead to protectionist pressures at the
micro-economic or even the national level – so we still have a long way to go. But it
is increasingly accepted as the best means we have raising the sustainable rate of
growth – and employment – and living standards - at the macro-economic, and
international, level.
These trends together have resulted in substantial economic progress in most of the
developed economies. But – and this is the third theme I would draw attention to this
morning – there was growing recognition of the fact that not all countries were
equally well-placed to share in the potential benefits of free markets within a stable
macro-economic framework, and of the need – as a matter of self-interest and not just
social responsibility – to help draw other countries in to the global economy.
Emerging markets and transition economies have increasingly gained access to
international capital markets. And there is an increasing emphasis on the need to help
the poorest countries that are seeking to help themselves to participate. This last
concern will be on the agenda of the Monterrey conference next month.
Now, all of these developments have had – and will continue to have – enormous
influence on the evolution of the financial environment, including bond markets
internationally.
Monetary stability has brought a sustained decline in nominal government bond yields
in industrial countries, and a narrowing of yield differentials, which was
inconceivable during much of the earlier part of my working life. And fiscal
prudence has brought not just a proportional, but in some countries an absolute,
decline in the amount of private savings absorbed by government debt. That has left
room for a rapid expansion and diversification of the corporate debt market to
accommodate increasing demand, as the role of the private sector has increased. And
the sovereign debt market, too, has diversified to include those emerging markets and
transition countries that have succeeded in accessing the increasingly free
international flow of capital.
These are big, long-run, changes which, are for the most part likely to continue. So
your job – as investors and investment managers, won’t get any easier!
I have the impression that the investing public is still coming to terms with the lower
nominal returns that they can expect if we really are in a world of sustained low
inflation. So they may be demanding quite a lot from you.
It’s true that in an environment of sustained monetary stability you might not see the
very large and unpredictable swings in interest rates that I grew up with. I don’t
suggest that that interest rate risk will go away altogether – though if I could make
just one comment on the current macro-economic situation you’ll be discussing in a
moment, it would be to caution you against placing too much weight on the steepness
of the short-term interbank interest rate futures curve as an indicator of the likely

4
course of official short-term interest rates – at least in the UK: our impression is that it
includes quite a significant term premium. But even if interest rates are some degree
less volatile, in a context of overall monetary stability, we certainly won’t avoid
sectoral imbalances such as we have seen over the past year or so; nor can we exclude
policy failures in individual countries, which can, as we saw in the Asia crisis but
happily not in the present case of Argentina, have wider repercussions. So I suspect
you will have your work cut out in pricing and managing credit risk in your
necessarily more diversified bond portfolios.
You have a difficult job. But the efficiency with which the market allocates financial
resources depends upon your doing it well. It is a heavy responsibility.
But the official community equally has a responsibility to help in so far as it can. And
we can help, I think, in three main ways.
The first is through transparency in our macro-economic policies – in the provision of
reliable data, and through clarity in both our monetary and fiscal objectives, in our
analysis and in our decision-making, so that you are not exposed to wholly
unpredictable behaviour and can make your own considered judgements as to how far
our policies are likely to succeed. Your judgements, of course, can in turn have an
important bearing on our policy decisions.
Secondly we can help in providing robust infrastructures – and I have in mind not just
the financial infrastructure, though sound financial systems are clearly hugely
important, but much more widely the legal framework, accounting and disclosure
standards, and governance structures, for example, as they apply throughout the
private sector, so that again you can base your assessment of corporate credits on a
fuller understanding of the risks. We have been making very considerable efforts in
different international fora in recent years to establish codes and standards of best
practice in all these areas which can be universally applied, but I don’t need to remind
you how far we all still have to go.
And thirdly, in relation to sovereign debt, I think that the international community
could, and should, do more to clarify the scale of official support that a country
running into difficulties might reasonably look for, and the kind of conditions that it
might expect to apply. As things stand at present neither the debtor countries nor their
private sector creditors have much idea what to expect, and may be tempted to assume
that they will be bailed out if things go wrong. Greater clarity could help to persuade
borrowers to face up to hard policy choices earlier, before things get out of hand, and
enable the creditors to make a more objective assessment of the risks. I think, too,
that it would be helpful if we could at least agree on best practice guidelines for a
debtor country’s handling of a situation in which it could not immediately honour its
obligations. That, too, could help creditors better understand the risks that they are
taking on.
But while the official community can help in these ways, in the final analysis the buck
stops with you, the investors. I find it encouraging that so many of you are attending
this conference, at which many of the relevant risks, and how they can be measured
and managed, will be discussed. I’m very tempted to remain with you for your
discussions, but sadly I have my own job to do, which makes it impossible for me to
stay.
But I wish you, Padraic, and everyone here an enjoyable and interesting couple of
days in what has become the best tradition of this very special event.
