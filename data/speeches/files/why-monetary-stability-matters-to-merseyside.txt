It is a great pleasure to be back in Merseyside, as the guest of the Mersey Partnership.
It’s always inspiring to be in a city that has a great future as well as a glorious past –
and I’m not referring to Will Alsop’s SuperCity of the North. When I was last in
Liverpool everyone was on tenterhooks waiting to hear the outcome of the
European Capital of Culture. Congratulations on a spectacular result. By all accounts
you’re set to be European Capital of shopping too when the new Grosvenor
development opens in the Paradise area of the city.
This is my first visit as a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC). Of course, the Bank and Liverpool go back a very long way.
Liverpool was a village when the Bank was founded. By the time we opened our first
branches around the country, that village had grown into a major port, the gateway to
the workshop of the world. So it was natural that the branch the Bank built in Castle
Street in around 1850 was one of its grandest, the work of Charles Cockerell. We still
have agents in the City – Neil Ashbridge and John Young. And only three years ago
the Bank’s Court held its annual out-of-London meeting in Liverpool’s imposing
Town Hall.
I am particularly pleased to launch this, the third edition of the Merseyside Economic
Review. The Partnership had its origins in a Daily Post campaign over a decade ago
(‘who speaks for Merseyside?’). It broke new ground then and it has been breaking
new ground ever since. The Economic Review was the first of its kind for any UK
City Region. And the Partnership’s report on ‘the Gender Agenda: Women in the
Merseyside economy’ is another first.
The value of the Partnership’s approach is clear. Economic regeneration is a highly
complex long term business which has to bring together many different bodies and
initiatives – at local, regional, national, European and even international levels. It’s
only too easy to lose sight of the big picture. But successful partnership rests on
shared goals and clear expectations.
This Review charts the way: it sets out in clear and simple terms what the Partnership
is seeking to achieve and it assesses progress against measurable objectives. It has the
credibility that comes from being grounded in serious analysis of the issues
confronting Merseyside. And it has benefited from the advice of an independent panel
of distinguished experts.
There is no doubt that the performance of monetary policy has benefited greatly from
setting clear objectives and measuring progress in a transparent and open way. The
UK first adopted specific targets for inflation over a decade ago, and at the same time
1

the Bank launched a new quarterly Inflation Report to share its thinking about the
economic prospect. In 1997, that approach was developed, and its credibility
significantly enhanced, when Gordon Brown gave responsibility for setting interest
rates to an independent Monetary Policy Committee, consisting of outside experts as
well as Bank of England officials.
By any past standards, the period since 1992 has seen a quite remarkable degree of
stability, with low and stable inflation and a record period of sustained positive output
growth and steadily improving employment. Better monetary policy is not the whole
story; but it can share some of the credit for that success.
How does monetary stability like this benefit an area like Merseyside?
The Bank of England’s job is to control inflationary pressure in the country as a
whole. What we do is set interest rates to keep the total demand in the economy in
line with the economy’s productive capacity. We don’t – and can’t – favour any
section of the economy, or the country.
Merseyside is a region facing deep seated economic and social challenges, stemming
from the decline in its traditional industries. In recent decades, many well paid jobs
have gone for ever, and in the new world, earning good money has required a very
different set of skills. That kind of change wasn’t just a challenge to individuals and
their families; it threatened the viability of whole communities.
Low inflation is not in itself a solution to problems like this. But it is a pre condition
for solving them. Merseyside had bad luck to be confronted with more economic
change in the second half of the twentieth century than most people could cope with
at the time. Liverpool never lost its sense of humour, though there were times when it
came close to losing its way. Sadly, you can’t laugh your way out of economic
decline.
High inflation and economic instability fostered the wrong climate for taking the long
term decisions that were needed to give Merseyside a new future. The levels of
economic inactivity and social deprivation that you are still grappling with today are
in part legacies of the 1970s and 1980s, when the sharp ups and downs in inflation,
interest rates and national output made it much harder to adapt to structural economic
change at the regional level.
But more recent success in delivering low inflation and economic stability has created
a much better climate for you to succeed. Economic regeneration can’t get off the
2

ground without inspired local leadership, and committed local partnerships. But even
with them, it is a long haul to make the investments in infrastructure that modern
businesses expect. And so called soft investments – in people, skills, and
communities – are even more of a challenge.
Low inflation and low nominal interest rates matter to you because they provide a
sound foundation for just this kind of long term planning. And business needs a
climate of stability if it is to commit to the investment that’s needed to revitalise an
area. We know that it is entirely possible to transform old urban areas – there are
plenty of inspiring examples from London Docklands to Berlin and Baltimore, and if
Liverpudlians ever doubted it, nowadays they need go no further than Albert Dock.
But it takes long term commitment.
The key findings in today’s Merseyside Economic Review provide convincing
evidence that Liverpool has turned the corner– with faster growth in the core city than
any other English city and jobs growth more than double the national average.
Manufacturing remains important and there is still a strong automotive supply
industry, which is high tech these days, but the real growth sectors are tourism, leisure
and modern services. Increasingly, for those who acquire the right skills, the jobs are
there – a picture that fits with a national labour market where unemployment is now
as low as it has been in three decades.
How confident can you be that we will continue to deliver the stability that is our
contribution to your future success?
Our latest Inflation Report, published last week, paints a favourable picture for the
next few years, with continuing steady growth and low inflation. If you trust the MPC
to do its job, you might feel reasonably safe in basing your decisions on that outlook.
But those of us on the Committee can’t afford to take it for granted. So you may be
reassured to hear that we spend most of our time worrying about the risks that could
throw the UK economy off course; and arguing about how to respond appropriately.
So what are the main risks facing us now?
Last year saw the fastest growth in world output in three decades. We expect growth
this year to be less spectacular but still robust. But while the US and China are still
expanding strongly, growth has showed signs of faltering in Japan and, to a lesser
extent, in our major overseas market, the euro area, and especially Germany. We
think this weakness is likely to prove temporary, but we could be disappointed.

3

Unbalanced growth creates strains. The US has a large current account deficit, which
is mirrored by surpluses in the other major trading blocks. The risk is that a better
balance will only come about through sharp adjustments in exchange rates and a
marked increase in US savings, which may cause a slowdown in global activity.
Closer to home, there is uncertainty about the near term momentum of household
spending, by far the largest influence on domestic demand. While it is difficult to be
confident about the path of retail sales since the autumn, there is little evidence of
much underlying buoyancy. Retail sales are not the whole story, and our central view
is that any weakness in consumer spending is likely to be temporary. But we could
easily be wrong.
The other key uncertainty concerns the speed with which inflation will pick up.
Consumer price inflation remains below the Government’s 2% target but there are
good reasons to expect it to rise over the next few years. Input cost inflation has risen
sharply, and import prices are not falling as much as they were. We think there is very
little slack in the economy. The labour market is certainly tight. But the growth in
labour costs has been surprisingly muted, and some cost pressures have been absorbed
by lower profit margins. How long can this last?
At present we think inflation is likely to rise above target sometime next year, though
we judge the risks to be somewhat on the downside. But it’s a difficult call, and our
judgement about the balance of risks will be influenced by the way the data shape up
in the coming months.
The MPC faces a familiar dilemma, torn between the importance of well grounded
analysis and the need to act promptly. On the one hand, there is a case for waiting for
more evidence on the issues that underlie these risks – as there almost always is; on
the other hand, since interest rates take a year or more to affect the economy, we need
to be pre emptive, to head off trouble at the pass so to speak, even at the risk of
sometimes taking the wrong decision.
If we get it right – and a lot of effort goes into ensuring that we do – the outcome of
our short term deliberations should be a degree of monetary stability that will create
the right climate for you to take the long term decisions on which your economic
success depends.
