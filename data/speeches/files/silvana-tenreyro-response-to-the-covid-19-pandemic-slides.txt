Outcomes related to differences in policy approach
• A sports analogy…
• UK/Europe: individual defence
– Short-term work schemes, government pays wage bills
– Protects existing job matches of individual workers

• US: zone defence
– Shock propagated more completely to the labour market
– Enhanced unemployment benefits & stimulus cheques boost
aggregate household income (and spending)

Labour market: US unemployment an outlier

Sources: OECD and Bank calculations. Notes: Harmonised unemployment rate.

Labour market: UK job retention scheme
• March 2020: temporary UK govt. job retention (furlough) scheme
– Government pays 80% of wages (up to certain limits)
– Intended to protect labour-market matches

• Scheme extensions as pandemic persisted
– Most recently to end Q3 2021

• Similar schemes in many other European countries

Open questions for researchers
• Extreme shock highlights the major role of counter-cyclical policy
influencing business cycles.
– How can we better account for this in our models?
– And in analyzing past cycles’ data?

• What have we learned about counter-cyclical policy design? How do
the effects depend on:
– Time horizon of the shock?
– Structure of the economy?
