When the legendary King Midas initially received the power to turn everything he touched into gold, he
deemed it highly successful; the benefits of being able to create immense wealth with simply the touch of his
finger far outweighed any costs. During the financial crisis, many central banks used less glamorous tools to
create base money - sharp reductions in interest rates and quantitative easing. These measures played a
critically important role in helping economies stabilize and recover.

King Midas soon realized, however, that this power of wealth creation came with unexpected side effects from making his food inedible to turning his daughter into a lifeless statue. As these costs accumulated,
King Midas eventually wished to give up his “golden touch” and return to normality. Similarly, is the current
UK policy of near-zero interest rates beginning to generate substantial costs? Is there a point where any
costs accumulate such that they outweigh the benefits? Could near-zero interest rates become less
“golden”?

The UK recovery is now well in progress and self-sustaining - despite continual headwinds from abroad. The
UK has grown at or above its potential growth rate for 5 quarters (based on BoE estimates and its backcast).
The MPC forecasts that this at- or above-trend growth will continue over the next three years.
Unemployment has fallen rapidly, from 8.4% about 3 years ago to 5.7% today, and is expected to continue to
fall to reach its equilibrium rate within two years. Wage growth appears to finally be picking up, so that when
combined with lower oil prices, families will, at long last, see their real earnings increase. Granted, there are
still substantial challenges and deep scars from the recession. For example, output only surpassed its
pre-crisis peak in the third quarter of 2013, and real wages have fallen by 7% since the end of 2007. But all
in all, the pieces appear to be in place for the recovery to continue. The economy appears to largely be
beginning to normalize after a severe and protracted crisis.

The one piece of the economy that has not yet started this process of normalization, however, is interest
rates. Bank Rate - the main interest rate set by the Bank of England - remains at its emergency level of
0.5%. This near-zero interest rate made sense during the crisis and early stages of the faltering recovery. It
continues to make sense today. But at what point will it no longer make sense? Low interest rates provide a
number of benefits. For example, they make it easier for individuals, companies and governments to pay
down debt. They make it more attractive for businesses to invest - stimulating production and job creation.
They have helped allow the financial system to heal. They have played a key role in supporting the UK’s
recent recovery. Increases in interest rates - especially after being sustained at low levels for so long - can
also involve risks.

But there are also costs and risks from keeping interest rates at emergency levels for a sustained period,
especially as an economy returns to more normal functioning. Interest rates sustained at emergency levels
could lead to costs such as: (1) inflationary pressures; (2) asset bubbles and financial vulnerabilities; (3)
limited tools to respond to future challenges; (4) an inefficient allocation of resources and lower productivity;

(5) vulnerabilities in the structure of demand; and (6) higher inequality. The remainder of my comments will
discuss these costs and risks from a sustained period of near-zero interest rates. I will not dwell on the
benefits of low rates, not because these are not important, but because they have been well discussed
2

elsewhere. I will conclude by evaluating how important these costs are today - and if the policy of near-zero
interest rates is at risk of going the way of Midas’ golden touch.

1. Inflationary pressures
In today’s era of inflation targeting, the primary reason why central banks raise interest rates is to reduce
inflationary pressures. This is also true in the United Kingdom, where the primary mandate for the
Monetary Policy Committee is to steer inflation to its 2% target in the medium term. The MPC’s preferred
tool to achieve this target is through adjustments to Bank Rate. Could inflationary pressures provide a
reason to raise interest rates today?

At first glance, with CPI inflation well below target at 0.3% in January, this may sound like a silly question.
Although headline inflation was above target for 65 of the last 85 months since 2008, it is now well below this
target. And not only is headline inflation low today, but it may fall lower over the next few months, with a
good chance it will briefly be negative.

These headline numbers, however, are not the appropriate way to assess whether interest rates are set
appropriately to meet a medium-term inflation target. The primary reasons for low inflation today are external
factors that will fade quickly - primarily the sharp fall in oil and gas prices, as well as declines in food and
other commodity prices, and the lagged effects of sterling’s past appreciation. These factors will restrain
headline inflation throughout this year, but then quickly drop out. Even the more lagged effects of sterling’s
appreciation will likely peak in the first part of this year and also gradually fade. Inflation will then most likely
bounce back. Since interest rates take well over a year to be fully effective, they should be adjusted to
respond to inflationary risks at that time horizon (when all of these effects have diminished) - rather than
respond to today’s inflation.
Therefore, to assess if today’s low headline inflation rates could be masking future inflationary risks that
could be worsened by a prolonged period of near-zero interest rates, it is useful to look at underlying
inflationary pressures. To track this, I closely follow seven measures of “domestically-generated inflation” different statistics that attempt to strip out the direct effects of external price pressures to assess underlying
price momentum within the UK. Each of these measures has its strengths and weaknesses, so it is useful to

1

These are obviously not the only potential costs. For example, the fall in gilt yields has contributed to a surge in deficits in defined
benefit pension funds, which use yields to discount liabilities. For my comments today, however, I will focus on the costs and risks that
most directly relate to the broader economy and the MPC’s mandate.

track the mean and range of the indicators. This is shown in Figure 1 - with the mean in green and lowest
and highest values of these indicators in red. The graph shows that, on average, domestically-generated
inflationary pressures have been relatively stable over the past year. There is no evidence of underlying
inflationary pressures picking up (suggesting no immediate inflation risk from low rates) but also no evidence
of underlying inflation falling (suggesting no immediate risk from deflation). In fact, domestic inflationary
pressures, although below the average of 2.6% from 1998 to 2007, are close to the 2% inflation target today.

Looking forward, low headline inflation and stable domestically-generated inflation are unlikely to persist if
interest rates remain low. As discussed in February’s Inflation Report, the output gap is closing and there is
limited slack left in the economy. The rate of wage growth is increasing - with AWE total pay growth in the
three months to December of 2.1% relative to a year earlier, but 5.4% (annualised) relative to 3-months
earlier. Since wages are an important component of prices and their recent pick-up has not been matched
with a corresponding increase in productivity, these wage increases will support a pickup in inflation. If this
pickup is gradual, as expected, inflationary pressures should only build slowly over time, so that interest
rates can be increased slowly and gradually as necessary.

There are certainly risks to this forecast. As I discussed in a speech in January, there are a number of risks
that could cause inflation to pick up faster and necessitate a more rapid adjustment in interest rates than
currently expected (such as a stronger global growth, permanently lower oil prices, faster pass-through, and
4

a smaller labour supply). There are also risks that could cause inflation to remain supressed for longer than
expected - such as if deflationary expectations affect consumer behaviour, global growth slows, or risk
aversion increases due to a breakdown in Greece’s financing or other geopolitical events. The bottom line,

excluding government goods and services, GDP deflator, and service-producer price inflation. See Forbes (2014) for details.

however, is that the current policy of near-zero interest rates does not yet appear to be generating incipient
inflationary pressures that could not be addressed in a timely fashion as needed.

2. Asset bubbles and financial instability

A second important potential cost from a sustained period of accommodative monetary policy is that it could
create risks and inefficiencies in financial markets and the overall financial system over time. Of course, low
rates can support financial stability by keeping debt burdens manageable, supporting economic growth, and
allowing financial institutions to rebuild balance sheets, all of which were especially important after the
financial crisis. But as rates continue to be low, especially during this period of recovery, the risks to the
financial system could grow. More specifically, when interest rates are low, investors may “search for yield”
and shift funds to riskier investments that are expected to earn a higher return - from equity markets to
high-yield debt markets to emerging markets. This could drive up prices in these other markets and
5

potentially create “bubbles”. This can not only lead to an inefficient allocation of capital, but leave certain
investors with more risk than they appreciate. An adjustment in asset prices can bring about losses that are
difficult to manage, especially if investments were supported by higher leverage possible due to low rates. If
these losses were widespread across an economy, or affected systemically-important institutions, they could
create substantial economic disruption.

This tendency to assume greater risk when interest rates are low for a sustained period not only occurs for
investors, but also within banks, corporations, and broader credit markets. Studies have shown that during
periods of monetary expansion, banks tend to soften lending standards and experience an increase in their
6

assessed “riskiness”. There is evidence that the longer an expansion lasts, the greater these effects.
Companies also take advantage of periods of low borrowing costs to increase debt issuance. If this occurs
during a period of low default rates - as in the past few years - this can further compress borrowing spreads
7

and lead to levels of debt issuance that may be difficult to support when interest rates normalize. There is a
lengthy academic literature showing that low interest rates often foster credit booms, an inefficient allocation
of capital, banking collapses, and financial crises.

8

This series of risks to the financial system from a period of low interest rates should be taken seriously and
carefully monitored. Recent regulatory reform, however, has attempted to reduce some of these risks. A
key part of this reform in the UK was the creation of the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which is charged
with monitoring, identifying, and taking action to remove or reduce these types of systemic risks in order to

Gurkaynak et al. (2005), Rigobon and Sack (2004), and D’Amico and Farka (2011). More recently, however, Gali and Gambetti (2014)
finds that while monetary policy easing leads to a short-run increase in stock prices, this may be followed by a persistent fall in stock
prices in the medium term. For evidence that persistently low interest rates can generate a broader search-for-yield and cause investors
to take on more risk, see Borio and Zhu (2012), Rajan (2005), and Stein (2013).

protect and enhance the resilience of the UK financial system. The FPC is currently alert to these risks. For
example, their latest Financial Stability Report discusses how low interest rates could cause investors to
“search for yield” and thereby misjudge underlying risks, which “can also be a potential source of financial
instability.”

10

The FPC also has a series of macroprudential tools that it can use, if merited, as the “first line of

defence” against any such risks to financial stability.

But can these tools of the FPC adequately address the wide-ranging risks that could build in the financial
system from a prolonged period of near-zero interest rates? My assessment is that, at the current time, the
arrangement appears to be working well. When frothiness does appear in one market - such as in the
housing market last year - the FPC showed that it will use its tools to mitigate perceived risks. By having the
FPC on the front lines to monitor and take action against any such financial risks, the MPC has more
freedom to focus on its primary target - price stability - when setting monetary policy. Financial stability risks
are squarely on the minds of MPC members - as evidenced by their inclusion of financial stability concerns in
their list of “knockout” measures in their forward guidance issued in February 2014.

11

Financial institutions

and investors can certainly still suffer losses - as many painfully experienced over the last few months when
they were on the wrong side of movements in oil and currency markets. But this is part of a healthy,
well-functioning financial system - as long as individual losses do not become systemic.

But, going forward, will this arrangement with the FPC be enough?

12

If economic growth continues at or

above trend, the financial system continues to heal, and the cost of borrowing in the UK remains near zero,
these risks to the financial system could build. This risk is magnified by the even more accommodative
monetary policy and low rates of return in other major economies - even negative interest rates in some
regions. It is hard to believe, but a policy rate of 0.5% in the UK is actually higher than that in a number of
other developed economies, possibly driving capital inflows to the UK. Low UK rates, combined with
increased capital inflows, could support an even greater “search for yield” in the UK in the near future. In
that case, if interest rates remain near zero, the FPC’s tools may not be sufficient to address financial
stability concerns. As Jeremy Stein, a former Federal Reserve Governor, so lucidly stated: “while monetary
policy may not be quite the right tool for the job, it has one important advantage relative to supervision and
regulation - namely that it gets in all of the cracks. The one thing that a commercial bank, a broker-dealer,
an offshore hedge fund, and a special purpose ABCP vehicle have in common is that they all face the same
set of market interest rates.”

13

At some point monetary policy may have a role to help fill in these “cracks”,

but at the current juncture, the tools of the FPC seem sufficient.

See the Financial Services Act 2012.
Financial Stability Report, December 2014.
11
On February 12, 2014, the MPC updated its forward guidance and stated that: “The Committee remains mindful that a prolonged
period of low rates could lead to risks to financial stability. The financial stability knockout recognises that, in some circumstances,
monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, but only as a last line of defence; that is, if the risks
cannot be contained by the substantial range of mitigating policy actions available to the Financial Policy Committee, the
Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in a way consistent with their objectives.” While the knockouts no
longer apply, the division of responsibilities between regulatory and monetary policy continues.

3. Limited monetary policy tools in the future
A third potential cost of maintaining interest rates at near-zero levels is that there is less “firepower” to
respond to future contingencies. There is no shortage of events that could cause growth to slow and
inflation to fall in the future - and the first response is normally to reduce interest rates. Reductions in interest
rates can be an important tool for stabilizing an economy.

14

Figure 2 shows the popularity of this response

for the UK since 1980. It graphs Bank Rate over time and denotes UK business-cycle slowdowns in gray
shading.

15

Interest rates have been on a long-term downward trend over time, but around this trend, have

frequently been lowered sharply in response to business cycle slowdowns. For example, if an “easing cycle”
is defined as the period during a slowdown from when rates are initially reduced until the last reduction,
Appendix Table A.1 shows that interest rates have been lowered by an average of 3.8 percentage points
over a period of 16 months during easing cycles in the UK. A similar calculation for the US, in
Appendix Table A.2, shows that interest rates have been reduced by an even larger 4.6 percentage points
over US easing cycles of a similar duration (with an average length of 18 months). The ability for central
banks to respond to business cycle slowdowns through sharp reductions in rates, often over a protracted
period of time, has been a key tool for stabilizing large economies.

Figure 2: UK business cycle slowdowns (in grey) and Bank Rate (in red)

Source: OECD and Bank of England.

If Bank Rate remains around its current level of 0.5%, however, there is obviously not room during the next
recession to lower it to the degree that has typically occurred. Bank Rate could go a bit lower than 0.5% (as
recently discussed in February’s Inflation Report). But rates could not be lowered by the average 3.8
percentage points that occurred during past easing cycles without creating severe distortions to the financial
system and functioning of the economy. The MPC could instead use other tools to loosen monetary policy -

14

The level of interest rates relative to its equilibrium is the central measure of whether monetary policy is loose or tight, but there is
evidence that changes in interest rates can also affect activity, see e.g. Cloyne and Hurtgen (2014).

such as guidance on future rate changes or quantitative easing. These tools are certainly viable, but it is
harder to predict their impact and harder to assess their effectiveness than for changes in interest rates.

Obviously it would not make sense to raise interest rates today - and risk causing a recession - just to have
rates high enough to be able to lower them to respond quickly to the next slowdown! Moreover, since the
next move in interest rates is most likely to be up, this constraint of having only limited space to move
interest rates lower will soon be less binding. But my main point is that maintaining rates at near-zero levels
when this is not appropriate given the economic conditions does create an opportunity cost in terms of
limiting the MPC’s toolkit for unexpected contingencies in the future. The costs could also be even more
subtle than limiting the MPC’s ability to use its most popular tool to respond to a slowdown. For example,
awareness of this lower bound may provide reason to be more cautious when tightening monetary policy
(due to the more limited toolkit for future responses) or a reason to raise rates earlier (to get further from the
lower bound), but then adjust at a slower subsequent rate.

4. Misallocation of resources and lower productivity growth

A fourth potential risk of a prolonged period of near-zero interest rates is that it could have detrimental effects
on the supply side of the economy - especially on productivity. This is a subtle argument. Low interest rates
generally support lending and improve access to credit - both of which should support investment. Over
time, this should increase the potential supply of an economy and increase productivity. But - is there a
chance that a prolonged period of near-zero interest rates is allowing less efficient companies to survive and
curtailing the “creative destruction” that is critical to support productivity growth? Or even within existing,
profitable companies - could a prolonged period of low borrowing costs reduce their incentive to carefully
assess and evaluate investment projects - leading to a less efficient allocation of capital within companies?
Any of these effects of near zero-interest rates could play a role in explaining the UK’s unusually weak
productivity growth since the crisis.

These types of concerns gained attention in Japan during the 1990s after the collapse of the Japanese real
estate and stock market bubbles. During this period, many banks followed a policy of “forbearance”, during
which they continued to lend to companies that would otherwise have been insolvent. These unprofitable
companies kept alive by lenient banks were often referred to by the colourful name of “zombies”.

16

Caballero et al (2008) show that zombie firms can lower an industry’s average productivity, not only due to
the direct effect of less productive firms continuing to operate, but also due to an indirect effect of deterring
the entry of more productive firms. Allowing “zombies” to continue operating means that there is less capital
and financing available for newer and potentially more efficient companies and projects. Bank of England

16

For evidence, see Peek and Rosengren (2005), which finds that firms in poorer financial health and affiliated companies were more
likely to receive additional lending from Japanese banks in order to avoid recognising losses on bank balance sheets.

research has also shown that forbearance by industry is correlated with lower firm entry rates, which can
contribute to lower productivity growth.

17

Could similar effects be occurring in the UK today?

18

Figure 3 shows that rates of liquidation are currently

abnormally low. Liquidations spiked during the crisis, as usually occurs during recessions, but have
stabilized over the past few years at levels well below their pre-crisis average. In fact, in September
company liquidations as a share of all active companies fell to its lowest level since the series started in
1990.

19

This is even unusual for a recovery.

Low bankruptcy rates, however, could be caused by a number of factors - each of which could have differing
implications for the allocation of resources and productivity growth. Are bankruptcy rates low because banks
are following the Japanese example of forbearance and allowing loss-making firms to stay afloat - which
could be highly detrimental to productivity growth? Or were weaker companies purged during the crisis so
that the lower bankruptcy rates simply reflect the stronger operating position of firms still existing today? And
possibly contributing to this - are low interest rates allowing companies to appear profitable today due to their
low debt servicing costs?

A team at the Bank of England looked at this for UK firms in 2013 and concluded that bank forbearance
appeared to play some role during the crisis, especially for companies in the commercial and real estate
sector, and that this made a small contribution to lower productivity growth at the time.

20

But the analysis also

found that by 2013, forbearance did not appear to be playing an important role. Instead, some firms
appeared to be kept alive through the low interest rate environment. This contributed to very low overall
interest payments relative to pre-tax profits, as shown in Figure 3, helping keep some firms solvent.

17

See chart 7 in Arrowsmith et al. (2013).
See Broadbent (2012) for a thoughtful discussion of how credit constraints and high borrowing costs may have negatively affected
productivity growth and the allocation of resources during and immediately after the crisis.

The Enterprise Act 2002 included changes to the bankruptcy law, which complicates a comparison of these statistics across time.

A closer look at data on liquidations and estimates of loss-making companies, however, paints a slightly
more nuanced picture. Figure 4 graphs company liquidations in just England and Wales and the number of
loss-making companies as a percentage of all companies in the sample. This graph shows a similar decline
in liquidations, but although the number of loss-making companies has come down recently, it is still
substantially higher than before the crisis. It is possible that many of these loss-making companies are either
still receiving some type of forbearance and/or are kept “alive” by the low level of interest rates.

It is no surprise that low interest rates will make it easier for companies to stay solvent than would occur with
higher rates; in some sense this is part of the goal of lower rates - to support employment and growth. But
does this have a meaningful impact on overall productivity? This is extremely difficult to test formally, but
several pieces of evidence suggest that it may be playing a role. When resources are being allocated
efficiently, it is more difficult for less efficient firms to continue operating, and more profitable firms will tend to
have faster investment growth. Both of these relationships, however, are much weaker in the UK than
before the crisis. For example, one firm-level study has shown that more profitable firms no longer have
faster rates of investment growth (as they did before the crisis).

21

And Figure 5 shows that there has been a

substantial increase in the dispersion of firm productivity across sectors since the crisis. This is driven
primarily by substantially less productive firms continuing to operate - another pattern which did not hold
before the crisis.

persisted, it is increasingly likely that the low cost of
funds is playing some role.

For further evidence on this capital misallocation,
one could estimate the rate of “scrappage” during
the crisis and the level of capital relative to its

optimal, steady-state level. Recent BoE work has found tentative evidence of a “capital overhang”, an
excess of capital above that judged optimal given current conditions. Usually any such capital overhang falls
quickly during a recession as inefficient factories and plants are shut down and new investment slows. The
slower reallocation of capital since the crisis could partly be due to low interest rates.

Finally, different sectors might have responded differently to the low interest rate environment. For example,
those more reliant on debt and hence more sensitive to changes in Bank Rate might have seen their
productivity fall more than usual if the low level of interest rates allowed them to continue operating without
having to restructure their businesses. A recent project we’ve been working on suggests this does not
appear to be true. If anything, the productivity of interest rate sensitive sectors has fallen less than one might
have expected based on the pre-crisis relationship.

this reallocation, consider the relative size of

(a) Tradable industries include all production sectors excluding energy,
while non-tradables include all services. Different sectoral splits (such
as including energy as one of the tradable sectors or financial
intermediation as a tradable rather than non-tradable industry) does not
change the pattern of reallocation after the two large sterling moves in
the sample.

(rather than looking at their shares in total investment
separately). The black dotted line in Figure 6 shows
that this ratio fell from 3.2 to 2.3 (or by about 30%) in
the aftermath of the depreciation, consistent with a
reallocation of resources to tradable sectors. Between
1997 and 2000 – after sterling appreciated by just over
20% – this ratio increased by about 38%.

5. Increased vulnerabilities in the structure of demand

A fifth possible cost of low interest rates is that it could shift the sources of demand in ways which make
underlying growth less balanced, less resilient, and less sustainable. This could occur through increases in
consumption and debt, and decreases in savings and possibly the current account. Some of these effects of
low interest rates on the sources of demand are not surprising and are important channels by which low
interest rates are expected to stimulate growth. But if these shifts are too large - or vulnerabilities related to
overconsumption, overborrowing, insufficient savings, or large current account deficits continue for too long they could create economic challenges.

23

The limited backrun of data means that a comparison is only possible with the period after the 1996/7 appreciation.

Let me begin with the effects of lower interest rates on consumers; lower rates reduce the return to saving
and make it cheaper to borrow, creating an incentive for households to reduce savings, borrow more, and
spend more today. Figures 7 and 8 show that households have increased consumption and reduced
savings as expected. Consumer borrowing and debt levels, however, have moved in the opposite direction
of what might be expected.

24

Figure 9 shows that instead of increasing borrowing in response to low rates,

households have been reducing their overall debt to income levels. Furthermore, Figure 10 shows that
households with different mortgage exposures are experiencing a stabilization or decline in their mortgage
debt to income ratios. Consumers do not appear to be going on a borrowing binge - despite the lower
borrowing costs that most, though not all, face.

25

This does not imply that an increase in interest rates -

whenever that occurs - will not create challenges for some households in servicing existing debt. But the
current policy of near-zero interest rates does not appear to be aggravating any such vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, even though consumption growth has been increasing and saving rates falling, neither appears
to yet be at levels out of line with historic norms. More specifically, annual consumption growth averaged 2%
over the past four quarters (2013Q4-2014Q3), lower than the average rate of 3.7% during the 10 years
before the crisis (from 1998 through 2007). Although the savings ratio has fallen sharply from a peak of
11.5% during the crisis (in 2010Q3) to 7% today (2014Q3), this is not far lower than the 8.7% average over
the same pre-crisis period. Another potential indication of whether consumption is out of line with historic
trends is to examine its contribution to overall GDP

In addition to increasing vulnerabilities in the consumption component of demand, low interest rates could
also increase vulnerabilities in the external component of demand - the current account. The channels
through which low interest rates affect the current account, however, are less straightforward. Lower interest
rates tend to depreciate the exchange rate, making exports relatively cheaper and imports more expensive
(expenditure switching) - decreasing a current account deficit. Lower interest rates, by increasing consumer
spending as discussed above, generally lead to an increase in demand for imports from abroad (import
absorption) - increasing a current account deficit. Lower interest rates will also cause a shift to
higher-yielding foreign assets and a temporary increase in relative wealth, both of which will increase
investment abroad to increase returns and smooth consumption over time (search-for-yield and risk sharing)
- also decreasing a current account deficit.

Given these various channels, the net effect on the current account from these various effects of low interest
rates is a priori indeterminate. While some empirical studies find that looser monetary policy generally leads
to a reduction in a current account deficit,

26

some DSGE models (including the BoE’s own COMPASS model)

yield the opposite prediction. A closer look at the recent evolution of the current account could support
multiple theories. As shown in Figure 12, the trade deficit has recently declined - which could relate to an
expenditure-switching,risk-sharing, or search-for-yield effect. Net capital inflows have also increased sharply
to over £25 billion (the counterpart of the current account deficit) - which could relate to an import absorption
effect.

See Hjortsoe, Weale and Wieladek (2015) and Lee and Chin (2006) for academic work on this topic. Also, in the short-term there may
be a J-curve effect in which the current account first deteriorates before improving.

One major complication with this analysis and its interpretation, however, is that even though UK interest
rates are near zero, they are still higher than in many other countries. This is especially true for our most
important trade and financial partner - the euro zone - and other European economies. As a result, even
though UK interest rates are near zero, some of the channels discussed above related to the current account
could be reversed relative to certain countries with lower rates. Given these multifaceted challenges in
understanding exactly how near-zero rates in the UK could be affecting the current account balance, it is
impossible to assess its current impact with any confidence. Therefore, even though the UK current account
is large and may grow to be an important vulnerability in the future, it is impossible to draw any conclusions
about how the current policy of near-zero interest rates may be affecting any such vulnerability today.

6. Inequality

A final concern related to an extended period of ultra-accommodative monetary policy is how it might affect
inequality. Changes in monetary policy always have distributional implications, but these concerns have
recently received renewed attention - possible due to increased concerns about inequality more generally, or
possibly because quantitative easing has more immediate and apparent distributional implications. How a
sustained period of low interest rates impacts inequality, however, is far from clear cut.

27

There are some channels by which low interest rates - and especially quantitative easing - can aggravate
inequality. As discussed above, lower interest rates tend to boost asset values. Recent episodes of
quantitative easing have also appeared to increase asset prices - especially in equity markets - although the
magnitude of this effect is hard to estimate precisely.

28

Holdings of financial assets are heavily skewed by

age and income group, with close to 80% of gross financial assets of the household sector held by those
over 45 years old (Figure 13) and 40% held by the top 5% of households (Figure 14). As discussed in a
recent BoE report, these older and higher income groups will therefore see a bigger boost to their financial
savings as a result of low interest rates and quantitative easing.

29

But, counteracting these effects, are also powerful channels by which lower interest rates (and quantitative
easing) can reduce inequality and disproportionately harm older income groups. More specifically, one
powerful effect of low rates is to reduce pension annuity rates, interest on savings, and other fixed-income
payments. This disproportionately affects the older population (who relies on pensions and fixed income as
a larger share of their income) and people in the middle of the income distribution (who have some savings,
but less exposure to more sophisticated investments that can increase in value from lower rates). In addition
to affecting the asset and earnings side of individual’s balance sheets, there can also be distributional
consequences on the liability and payment side. As interest rates and the cost of servicing debt fall,

individuals with mortgages and other borrowing can benefit.

30

These benefits tend to disproportionately fall

on the middle class - for which mortgage and debt payments are a higher share of total income - but can also
benefit the wealthy if they have high levels of borrowing.

Figure 13: Distribution of household financial
assets by age group

(a)

Figure 14: Distribution of household financial
assets

(a)

A final way in which low rates can affect inequality is even harder to measure, but also potentially powerful.
If loose monetary policy stimulates job creation, this benefits the unemployed, who are disproportionately
from the lower end of the income distribution.

31

Much of the recent increase in UK employment has come

from the long-term unemployed, those with lower skills, and less experience. This trend is expected to
continue, and possibly accelerate, as short-term unemployment is at 2.8% (below its pre-crisis average of
3.2%). As a result, most net new jobs created will be filled by those who have been unemployed for some
time, who are less experienced, and less skilled - all of whom are more likely to be from the lower part of the
income distribution. Since wages from employment are the primary source of income for most of these
individuals, this effect could be powerful in boosting their incomes and reducing inequality.

Tying all of these channels together, it is unclear what the net effect on inequality is of a prolonged period of
extremely accommodative monetary policy. The various distributional effects act in different directions on
different segments of the population. Most analyses find that an increase in interest rates disproportionately
benefits retirees (from higher pension payments) and people at the higher end of the income distribution
30

Cloyne et al (2015) find that mortgagors’ consumption, income and consumption relative to income responds significantly more to
monetary policy changes than outright homeowners’.
31

(who have higher net savings). For example, one careful analysis of these various distributional effects uses
US micro-level data and finds that higher interest rates generally increase inequality across households in
income, labour earnings, expenditures, and consumption.

rates on income and spending by age

Figure 17: Impact of a 1 percentage point rise in

which only captures some of these effects, finds that
higher interest rates could lead to greater percentage
falls in income and spending in the population aged 25
to 44 (Figure 15) and for the highest income quintiles
(Figure 16), even after removing retirees (Figure 17).

33

These later effects could occur because of the high
levels of borrowing for those in the top income groups
(for which payments would increase). But unfortunately
the study does not have information on how higher rates
might affect other sources of income (such as from
equities and other investments), so it cannot fully
capture the effects of changes in interest rates on these
different groups. Further analysis of these various
effects of monetary policy on income distribution would
be a fruitful – albeit challenging - area for future
research.

7. Tying it all together: The midas touch?

Now, let me attempt to tie this all together and return to my key question. Are the costs of extremely
accommodative monetary policy accumulating, so that the once “golden” policy of near-zero interest rates
could become as unattractive as Midas’ touch?
Of the six main costs I’ve discussed, three appear to be moderate and manageable today, but could
deteriorate quickly and therefore merit close monitoring. Loose monetary policy will eventually generate
inflationary pressure, but headline inflation is currently contained largely due to external factors. Domestic
inflation is fairly stable and does not yet show imminent signs of acceleration or deceleration. Loose
monetary policy may eventually foster financial sector vulnerabilities and asset bubbles - for which the FPC
is watching and ready to respond as the first line of defence if merited - with the MPC as backup.
Accommodative monetary policy is supporting a sharp pickup in consumption growth and fall in the saving
rate, but this does not yet appear to be outside of historic norms or be stimulating unhealthy borrowing or
household debt accumulation. All of these trends merit close attention - as they could directly impact the
MPC’s primary mandate (inflation) or its secondary mandates (economic and financial stability). Any could
factor into a case to tighten monetary policy in the near future. But they do not currently appear to be
generating a sufficient cost to merit a change in interest rates today.

Three of the other six costs may create some challenges, but it is extremely difficult to measure their direct
relationship with near-zero interest rates with any confidence - besides being even further from the MPC’s
mandate. More specifically, there is some evidence that extremely accommodative monetary policy could be
contributing to slower productivity growth and inequality - but the evidence is partial, very mixed, and far from
conclusive. There are also valid arguments why lower rates could have the opposite effects - such as raising
productivity growth through spurring investment, or reducing inequality through spurring the creation of
lower-skilled jobs. Interest rates near zero means that the available “tool kit” to sharply loosen monetary
policy is more limited, but this cost has been alleviated somewhat by the ability to use non-conventional tools
and lower rates below the current 0.5%. Raising interest rates today would be an extremely inefficient and
ineffective tool for addressing concerns about productivity, inequality, or the MPC’s toolkit - even if it was
possible to make the case that it was within our mandate.
Therefore, near-zero interest rates do not yet appear to have gone the way of Midas’ touch. The golden fruit,
golden lambskin, and golden carriage that were the first objects of King Midas’ new gift still remain
appreciated. But just as King Midas soon wished to end his magical touch in order to live a healthy and
nourished life, the current policy of near-zero interest rates will need to end. Hopefully we will not wait until
the costs are as high as when King Midas turned his daughter into gold. According to the legend, the river
Pactolus, in which King Midas washed away his touch, was not destroyed, but instead was forever after
known for its shimmering deposits of gold. Similarly, gradual increases in interest rates, if they occur in a
timely fashion, should not derail the UK recovery, but instead support and strengthen it.
