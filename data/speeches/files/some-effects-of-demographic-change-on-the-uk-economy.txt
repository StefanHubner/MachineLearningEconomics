The UK is experiencing major demographic changes from population ageing, reflecting rising life expectancy
and the maturing baby boom generation. These trends probably do not significantly affect the economy’s
growth rate from quarter to quarter. But demographic trends are causing deep structural changes in the
economy. In the last 10-15 years, these effects from population ageing have been fairly benign, reducing the
equilibrium jobless rate and neutral interest rate. However, effects of population ageing will become more
challenging in the next 5-10 years, with greater downward effects on labour supply and, possibly,
productivity. If the UK is to avoid a further slowdown in potential economic growth, productivity growth will
need to pick up, which will probably require continued investment in physical and human capital.i
The early phase of population ageing – expansion of the 40+ and 50+ age groups – has been underway for
some time. Twenty five years ago, the number of people aged 20-49 years was roughly 40% greater than the
number aged 50 years or over. Now the two groups are almost the same size. The cross over point will come
in the next three or four years,ii with – probably for the first time ever – more people aged 50+ years than
20-49 (see figure 1).iii
The UK has now entered the middle phase of population ageing, with rapid growth in the 60+ and 70+ age
groups (see figure 2). The late phase, with rapid growth of the population aged 80+ years, will start in the
mid-2020s.
These ageing trends are widespread across advanced economies and some emerging markets. The point at
which the 50+ population exceeds the 20-49 population occurred more than 10 years ago in Japan and in
the last few years in Germany, France and Italy.iv Canada will get there in 2020-25, China around 2030.
In some countries, for example Japan, E Europe and S Europe, ageing is being accompanied by outright
population decline (see figure 3). That is not the case for the UK. On central estimates, the UK population will
continue to grow in coming decades, albeit more slowly than recently.
While these broad demographic trends are pretty much definite, there are some uncertainties in the exact
profile, in particular regarding migration. The UK projections above use the ONS central estimate. If we use
the ONS low migration variant,v population growth over the next 10 years would be 0.3-0.4% per year,
roughly half the central projection. Moreover, since migrants tend to be younger than the existing population,
lower inward migration would imply faster population ageing.
It may seem tempting to compress demographic change into one statistic, such as the dependency ratio.vi
But, in practice, the economic effects of ageing occur at different stages. For example, the early stage of
population ageing (rising share of the 40+ and 50+ population) tends to lift private savings and hence
depress real interest rates. Downward effects on workforce participation are driven more by the 60+ share
and 65+ share – the middle stage of ageing – and hence occur a little later. The late stage of population
ageing (rising 80+ share) will tend to have larger effects on public spending on health and social care.vii

Demographic change affects the economy in a range of ways.viii I want to focus on labour market effects –
the equilibrium jobless rate, labour supply and productivity – as well as effects on interest rates and
monetary policy. Some are already evident. Others may develop with more force over coming years.
Most of the effects of ageing discussed in this speech are compositional effects. In aggregate, older people
have different patterns of work, spending and saving than younger people and so a rise in the population
share of older people can affect how the economy works.
These effects may be reinforced, or countered, by behavioural changes. Some of these may reflect reactions
to population ageing, including through shifts in government policies on, for example, pensions, retirement
and benefits. We also need to allow for other behavioural changes, especially from rising education
attainment. Over the last 25 years, the share of the 25-64 age population with tertiary level (ie university or
similar) education has risen from 19% to 43%, a bigger rise than in most advanced economies (see figure
4).ix The tertiary education share among people aged 25-40 years is now around 50%, and the rise in this
measure has slowed in recent years. But even if this levels off, the tertiary education share among all people
aged 25-64 years will keep rising – albeit more slowly – getting close to 50% in 2030, as highly educated
younger cohorts get older. This rise in education attainment will offset or delay the economic effects of
population ageing in some respects (eg participation, productivity) but magnify it in others (eg equilibrium
unemployment).
Let’s start with the labour market. Population ageing has probably reinforced other factors pushing down the
equilibrium jobless rate, U*.x Jobless rates for younger workers – aged below 35 years – tend to be
persistently higher and fluctuate more with economic conditions than jobless rates for older workers (see
figure 5). Younger people are often still finding the occupation that suits them best – a process known as ‘job
shopping’ – and more likely to be in a job that is a poor fit for their attributes and abilities.xi In addition,
younger people are often still acquiring skills and experience, and jobless rates for less-skilled workers tend
to rise relatively sharply in downturns. The result is that the flows of people between employment and
unemployment are relatively high for younger age groups, with a higher share out of work at any point and
bigger swings over the economic cycle. Conversely, older workers are less likely to lose their job and if they
do, they are more likely (than young people) to become self-employed as an alternative to unemployment.
With population ageing, the share of the workforce aged under 35 years is down from 46% in 1990 to 40% in
2000 and 36% now. This shift in workforce composition away from age groups that tend to have high jobless
rates has cut the equilibrium jobless rate by about 0.3 percentage point since 2007 and by about 1pp since
1990.xii This is probably smaller than the effects from wider education attainment,xiii but goes the same way.
Although the workforce will keep ageing, the effects on U* may not actually increase much in coming years.
This is because the big difference in jobless rates is between the under 35s and the rest of the workforce,
and most of the drop in the under 35s in the workforce already occurred. Population ageing in coming years

will lift the share of the over 55s in the workforce, and cut the share of people aged 45-54 years. But in terms
of jobless rates, differences between people in their 40s, 50s and 60s are not that large.
Demographic change might also reduce labour supply growth, partly through lower population
growth but especially through lower workforce participation.xiv Participation rates are relatively low
among younger people, because many are in full-time education. Participation tends to be high between 25
and 54 years (often called ‘prime working age’), much lower for people in their 60s, and close to zero above
75 years (see figure 6).
Between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s, demographic change lifted participation, because the
population shares of prime working age groups were rising, with a falling share of under 25s (see figure 7).
More recently, the rise in the older part of the population has started to reduce participation, with an effect of
just over 1½pp over the last 10 years (ie just over 0.15pp per year).xv
However, this has been offset by two major factors. First, the female state pension age (SPA) has risen from
60 to 65 years – a change that began in 2010 and completed this month. Research by the IFSxvi suggests
this has lifted workforce participation among women aged 60-64 years by about 10pp, adding 0.3-0.4pp to
the total participation rate. And second, the rise in education attainment noted earlier. At most age groups,
especially among women, higher education attainment lifts workforce participation, probably reflecting the
extent to which education opens doors to higher pay and wider job opportunities (see figure 8).xvii Using a
simple model, I estimate that rising education attainment has lifted participation by roughly 1½pp over the
last 10 years.xviii With these large effects from the SPA and education, the participation rate edged up over
the last 10 years despite adverse demographics. Cyclical conditions reduced participation between 2008 and
2013, but this effect largely unwound since then as the economy recovered. Other factors probably also
affected participation among specific groups of the population, including rising longevity, changes in annuity
rates, benefit legislation and health, but have played a lesser role in aggregate over that period (see figures
9 and 10).xix
Looking ahead, the adverse effects on participation from ageing will expand as the population shares of the
over 60s and over 70s rise markedly. The population of prime working age has risen by about ½% per year
over the last 10 years but will fall slightly from 2020 onwards. Our simple model suggests that ageing will cut
the participation rate by about 3pp over the next ten years (ie 0.3pp per year) – considerably more than the
effect over the last 10 years.
Pushing against this, age-specific participation rates are likely to continue to rise, especially for older
workers. The SPA for men and women is rising from 65 years to 66 years over the next two years, starting
next month, with a further rise to 67 years scheduled for 2026-28.xx The rise in the SPA – assuming it has
similar effects to the recent changes – will add 0.1-0.2pp to aggregate participation over the next two years.
The rising tertiary education share will also continue to lift participation, although this effect may be less

powerful than recently, because the tertiary education share will probably rise more slowly (given that the
rise among younger age groups has already slowed).
Combining these, this model suggests that in 2019-20, the rise in age-specific participation rates – and
especially from the rising SPA – will continue to offset effects of population ageing, with participation roughly
stable and workforce growth matching population growth at about 0.6% per year. Beyond that, with no further
changes in the SPA scheduled until 2026-28, the effects of ageing will dominate, with the participation rate
falling by 0.2-0.3pp per year and workforce growth slowing to about 0.3% per year (such that the
participation rate falls by about 2pp in total over the next 10 years), see figure 11.xxi
If we use the ONS low migration variant, the combined effects of ageing, education and the rise in the SPA
would imply roughly zero workforce growth from 2020 onwards.xxii
Under either migration path, the slowdown in labour supply may be reinforced slightly by trends in average
hours, given that the over 60s tend to work significantly fewer hours than other age groups, with a higher
share of part-time work.xxiii
I want to stress caveats here. The rise in the State Pension Age to 66 and then 67 years may have bigger or
smaller effects than the rise from 60 to 65 years. It also is possible that rising life expectancy will have
greater behavioural effects on labour supply, with people choosing to stay in the workforce for longer, or to
work more hours, beyond effects from changes to the pension age and education. So far, such effects do not
appear to have been large in aggregate. As noted earlier, a simple model based purely on education, spare
capacity and changes in the pension age tracks recent trends in participation fairly well. Moreover, among
those in work, there is a clear preference in the 55-64 and 65+ age groups to work fewer hours rather than
more hours (for the same hourly pay), see figure 12.xxiv But it is certainly possible that ageing will generate a
bigger labour supply response over time.
Let me turn to productivity growth. Some research suggests that ageing is likely to hit productivity, not just
through a shorter average work week (which might cut output per person) but by reducing output per hour.xxv
For example, as people get older, at some point the advantages of work experience may be offset by
depreciation of knowledge and skills, and reduced innovation.xxvi The balance between these effects
probably varies across different industries and different types of work. Older workers tend to move job much
less frequently than younger workers and hence population ageing may impede the diffusion of skills,
knowledge and technology use through reduced job-to-job flows.xxvii Against that, some research suggests
that when population ageing eventually reduces labour supply, labour scarcity will prompt greater investment
in labour-saving technology and automation that will boost productivity.xxviii

There is considerable debate over the causes of the UK’s recent productivity slowdown.xxix The fact that
productivity growth has slowed as population ageing kicks in might seem to indicate some link. But, in my
view, evidence that ageing has played a big role in the UK productivity slowdown is not clear cut.
For example, productivity growth (output per hour) in 2010-16 slowed from the pre-crisis average (19992007) in all of the UK’s 12 regions. But there is little link between regional trends in productivity and ageing.
Indeed, productivity slowed by more in regions which had a relatively small rise in the share of over 50s in
total employment or in the population (eg London), see figure 13. There also is little link between regional
changes in demographics and productivity growth at a sectoral level, for example if we compare productivity
growth in the manufacturing or financial services sectors in different regions (see figure 14).xxx
Some research that links ageing to weaker productivity growth is based on the observation that in many
countries, pay shows a marked hump-shaped profile across age groups. The UK is fairly typical in this
respect. Median hourly pay peaks at 40-49 years, falls 7-8% for the 50-59 age group and more than 20% for
the 60+ age group (see figure 15). If you assume an individual’s pay roughly reflects their productivity, then
at first glance these data hint at a marked age-related deterioration in productivity from 50 years onwards –
the age group that has recently been growing rapidly.
However, in the UK, the lower level of pay among the over 50s largely reflects lower average education
attainment for this age group rather than any inherent age-related decline.xxxi Among those with the same
education, people aged 50-59 years earn roughly the same as those aged 40-49 years and more than
people aged 30-39 years (see figure 16).xxxii Once you allow for education, the notion that there is a major
drop off in productivity beyond 50 years does not seem valid in the UK.
Taking people of similar education, adverse effects of ageing on pay are modest and confined to people
aged 60+, with median hourly pay for this age group about 10% below that of people aged 40-49 years.xxxiii
This gap has shrunk over time, especially for those without tertiary education, perhaps because fewer jobs
need hard manual labour and the general health of older people has improved.xxxiv Given that the share of
over 60s in total employment is still relatively low (10% now, versus 8% ten years ago), the possible
productivity shortfall among this age group has probably had only a modest effect on aggregate productivity
growth in recent years. Again, these data do not suggest that ageing has been a major factor in the UK’s
recent productivity slowdown.
Nevertheless, while population ageing probably has not been a major factor in the recent productivity
slowdown, it is hard to see how population ageing will be positive for human capital in coming years. And,
with soft trends in firms’ investment intentions, there is not much support to productivity from investment in
physical capital either.

Savings and real interest rates
Let’s turn to implications for household saving and real interest rates. Some commentators have argued that
population ageing is likely to lift real interest rates, because the rising share of retirees will reduce household
saving.xxxv However, the MPC judges that, in practice, population ageing currently is lifting the stock of
household assets, both in the UK and globally – and hence is pushing the equilibrium level of global real
interest rates lower, and will continue to do so for some time.xxxvi
Life cycle theory suggests that people tend to borrow more in the younger part of their working years,
accumulate assets during the latter part of their working years and run down their wealth in retirement. This
is broadly what you see in the data, both for the UK and other advanced economies.xxxvii Debt is higher
among younger households (see figure 17), whereas average household wealth follows a hump-shaped path
– peaking around 55-74 years and falling beyond that (see figure 18). At the moment, population ageing
means that a rising share of the population is in age groups with relatively high wealth levels (ie 45-74
years), hence lifting the equilibrium stock of savings.
In addition, perhaps in response to rising life expectancy, people on the whole seem to be deferring the point
at which they usually run down their wealth. For example, the average wealth of households aged 65-74
years is higher, relative to other households, than used to be the case.
These effects may be reinforced if, in response to rising life expectancy, people aim for a higher level of
savings to finance a longer period of retirement and age-related costs such as social care. It is hard to
disentangle this from other factors that may lift people’s desired savings (eg risk aversion, bequest motives,
accumulating funds for a deposit on a mortgage). But it is notable that the balance of households who
believe it is a ‘good time to save’ has risen close to its long-run average even though interest rates remain
relatively low in real and nominal terms (see figure 19).
For an individual open country, a higher stock of savings would produce an accumulation of external assets.
With a similar ageing trend across many countries, the combined effect is to push down on the global
equilibrium real interest rate, and this effect could be reinforced if anticipation of lower population growth
reduces capital spending growth.
Much of this demographic effect on equilibrium interest rates already occurred. From later next decade, this
aspect of demographics will not intensify further as the share of the 75+ and 80+ population – age groups at
which households are usually running down their wealth in a significant way – rises significantly (see figure
20).
Ageing may also have some effects on the monetary transmission mechanism.

A key part of the process whereby interest rate changes affect spending in the economy is through cashflow
effects on borrowers, who face rising debt service costs if interest rates rise, and hence adjust their
spending. Given the distribution of debts and assets, these effects largely come through people with
mortgages and households aged under 45 years or so. These are the groups that typically have relatively
high debts compared to income. Moreover, because younger households tend to have relatively low levels of
savings, they are generally more affected by changes in credit availability and less able to smooth their
spending in the face of cashflow effects. As a result, changes in interest payments have a relatively high
impact on their spending (see figures 21 and 22).xxxviii
Conversely, the direct effects of interest rate changes on aggregate spending of households aged 55+ years
are relatively small. Older people typically have less debt but more assets, and in aggregate benefit in
cashflow terms from higher rates. However, people with net savings tend to not adjust spending much in
response to changes in interest income.
Given the different spending responses by borrowers (who are generally relatively young) and savers (who
are generally older), a rise in interest rates lowers spending in aggregate. Of course, the full impact of
monetary policy changes, allowing for knock-on effects to incomes, jobs and asset prices, are more complex
and their distributional effects are more balanced.xxxix
Ageing might affect this part of the monetary transmission mechanism – the cashflow channel – in two ways.
The first is that, as the population ages, older people – whose spending is less affected by the cashflow
channel – account for a rising share of the population, incomes, wealth and spending.xl Since 2001, the
share of consumer spending done by people aged 50 years or older is up from 41% to 52%, while their
share in spending on consumer durables is up from 38% to 54% (see figure 23).xli
The second is that ageing, along with other factors, has produced marked changes in the aggregate
household balance sheet, which might affect the sensitivity of the typical household within each age group.
The share of households with a mortgage is down from 42% in 2000 to 28% – the lowest for at least 35
years – with a sharp drop among young people (see figure 24).xlii Conversely, the ratio of household wealth
to income has risen sharply. Most households that own their home have no mortgage.xliii These trends are
partly the direct result of population ageing, with fewer young households and more elderly savers. But they
are also indirect results from the interaction of the shift of wealth to older age groups with the reduced
availability of high LTV mortgages, which has made it harder for people with low levels of assets (who are
generally relatively young) to get a mortgage and buy a house.
Some research suggests that populating ageing has already reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy in
advanced economies, so that a given deviation of interest rates from neutral has less impact on the economy
than previously.xliv BoE research suggests that this is not the case for the UK so far, and that the total impact
8

of interest rate changes on growth and inflation is similar to the pre-crisis period.xlv The easing in mid-2016
seemed to provide the expected boost to the economy. To be sure, the NMG surveys suggest that the net
change in households’ income from rising interest rates has become slightly more positive in recent years.xlvi
Such a trend, if sustained, might over time reduce the direct effects on spending of interest rate changes.
But, this is only one of the ways that interest rate changes affect demand in the economy. Given the rise in
the household wealth-income ratio, in my view it also is possible that consumer spending might become
more sensitive to indirect effects of monetary policy changes on asset prices.xlvii
Clearly this is an issue that needs watching. If the monetary transmission mechanism does become less
powerful then, all else equal, monetary policy might need to be more active around a neutral stance to
stabilise the economy in the face of demand shocks.
To sum up on demographics, although population ageing is a multi-decade trend, it is affecting the economy
now and will continue to do so in coming years.
I want to finish with some brief comments on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.
For most of the last 10 years, the economy has generally had significant amounts of spare capacity. Under
those conditions, it has been appropriate to provide considerable monetary stimulus, in order to support
growth above potential and thereby prevent the economy getting stuck in a rut of low capacity use and
below-target inflation.
Now, with the economy having grown above its modest potential pace for six or seven years that spare
capacity has been used up, with supply and demand in the economy broadly in balance.
Looking ahead, assuming the economy adjusts smoothly to an average of Brexit end states, economic
growth is likely to continue to outpace potential, so that the economy moves into excess demand over the
next year or two. As a result, assuming that smooth adjustment to Brexit, the MPC as a whole judge that
some further rises in interest rates probably will be needed over time, in order to return to a more neutral
policy stance and thereby keep inflation on target over time.
My own hunch is that, conditioned on our Brexit assumptions, capacity pressures will probably build
somewhat faster than envisaged in our latest Inflation Report projections, reinforcing upward pressure on
pay growth. In this case, we would probably need to return to something like a neutral stance rather earlier
than implied by the current yield curve.
Nevertheless, that assumption of a smooth Brexit adjustment is itself uncertain. Recent business surveys,
including those by the CBI, suggest that Brexit uncertainties have caused a marked drop in business
confidence so far in Q4. This could be reflected in some weakness in near term activity data.

At least some of these Brexit uncertainties might be resolved quite soon. Either there will be a withdrawal
agreement and transition period or not. If there is a withdrawal agreement then the range of options for the
possible Brexit end state also may narrow.
Any such resolution of Brexit uncertainties may change the economic outlook, perhaps substantially. But the
monetary policy implications of different Brexit outcomes could go either way, depending on the effects on
supply, demand and the exchange rate.
For example, a smooth transition to a relatively close economic relationship with the EU would probably
boost business confidence, with pent-up demand propelling investment and hiring. The same factors might
well cause sterling to appreciate. The net effect would probably be higher growth and lower inflation than our
base case. But it is unclear whether it would be appropriate to tighten monetary policy more or less than
implied by the current yield curve (or indeed not adjust policy at all, or to loosen): this would depend on the
balance between potentially inflationary effects from stronger growth (relative to potential) and disinflationary
effects from a stronger pound.
Conversely, an early move to WTO trading rules with no transition would probably see business confidence
weaken, hitting investment and hiring. There might also be further adverse effects on potential growth.xlviii For
the same reasons, sterling would probably depreciate, with the resultant boost to inflation reinforced by any
extension of tariffs. The net effect would probably be higher inflation and lower growth, and it may be hard to
tell in real time whether any weakness in growth exceeds the deterioration in potential growth. The monetary
policy implications could go in either direction.
Monetary policy cannot prevent the necessary adjustment in the economy to EU exit. What monetary policy
will do is to remain focused on its primary objective of maintaining price stability, and by doing so to
contribute to broader stability in the economy as a whole.

Note: The NMG results report the direct impact of a 1 percentage point rise in interest rates on the cashflow and spending of different
age groups, defined by age of the head of household. Using reported data from the NMG survey, individual post-tax income is
calculated before being aggregated to give a measure of household post-tax income. Household consumption is taken to be
households’ post-tax income less their reported annual savings. For each household the impact on cashflow is the net effect of a 1pp
rise in the interest rate charged on their reported outstanding debts (allowing for whether that household has an interest-only or
repayment mortgage) and a 1pp rise in the interest rate charged on their deposits. Those estimates are aggregated and scaled by
current annual post-tax income. For each household, the impact on consumption is estimated as the change in interest
payments/receipts multiplied by their reported marginal propensity to consume out of higher interest payments/receipts from the survey
(please refer to 2017 Q4 Quarterly Bulletin article for more detail on how these MPCs are constructed). Those estimates are then
aggregated and scaled by estimated current annual consumption. ‘Savers’ are defined as those whose net income change would be
positive in response to a rise in interest rates, ‘mortgagors’ are defined as those with a mortgage whose net income change would be
negative in response to a rise in interest rates, and ‘unsecured borrowers’ are those without a mortgage whose net income change
would be negative in response to a rise in interest rates. Sources: Bank of England and ONS.

See Gratton and Scott (2017).
Using the ONS central projection.
iii
Based on UK data since 1953, and data for England and Wales since 1911. The 50+ share of the adult (20+) population was just 27%
in 1911, and is unlikely to have exceeded 50% before that.
iv
Based on UN population estimates. National sources may differ slightly.
v
In the central assumption, net inward migration averages 200,000 per year over 2018/19 to 2021/22, 165,000 per year thereafter. In
the low migration variant, net inward migration averages 120,000 per year over 2018/19 to 2021/22, 85,000 per year thereafter.
vi
This is generally measured as the ratio of population outside working age to those of working age.
vii
See OBR (2018).

See, for example, Nishimura (2012), Shirai (2012), Mester (2017), Aksoy et al (2016), Ferrero et al (2017).
ix
Since 2000, the tertiary education share (people aged 25-64 years) has risen by 20pp in the UK. This compares to averages rises of
14pp for the EU and 15pp for the OECD. Among 34 advanced economies, only Ireland, Luxemburg, and Korea have seen a bigger rise
in their tertiary education shares. Source: OECD.
x
See Aaronson et al (2015).
xi
See Gervais et al (2016).
xii
I keep the jobless rate for each 5-year age group (20-24 etc) stable, and calculate the change in total unemployment driven by
changes in the age split of the workforce.
xiii
See Saunders (2017).
xiv
Measured as the share of the 15+ population in the workforce.
xv
For these estimates, I keep the participation rate for each 5-year age group (eg aged 20-24 years etc) stable (at the 1983-2018
average), and calculate the change in aggregate participation that results purely from changes in the age split of the population.
xvi
See Cribb et al (2013) and ELSA (2018).
xvii
See Grigoli et al (2018).
xviii
I split the population into five-year groups (20-24, 25-29 etc) by age and gender, and estimate a simple regression model for
participation of each group using education attainment (primary education share and tertiary education share for that age and gender)
and the lagged output gap, with annual data over 2004-17. Due to data limitations, I extrapolate recent trends in participation for the
15-19, and 70-74 age groups. The education effect can be extrapolated from the coefficients and population trends. It may be hard to
distinguish between effects of education on participation and other factors, including changes in social attitudes. But a shift-share
analysis yields a similar estimate for the recent effects of rising education attainment on aggregate participation.
xix
For example, among men lacking secondary education, participation rates have fallen since 2000 among those in their 20s and 30s,
but risen at older age groups. The net change among the 25-59 age group is zero.
xx
A further rise to 68 years is planned to take effect in the mid-2040s. The Government has announced its intention to bring that forward
to 2037-2039, in line with the Cridland review.
xxi
Within the working age (15-64 or 16-64 years) population, demographics actually lifted participation in recent years, because the
share of the 60-64 age group (which has low participation) has fallen as the post-WW2 baby boomers move beyond 65 years. Of
course, working age participation is unaffected by the rising population share of the over 65s. For the 15-64 age group, the combined
effects of population ageing and education seem likely to lift participation slightly in the next year or two, before ageing effects dominate
to push participation lower. However, the 15-64 population itself will grow quite slowly, only by 0.3% or so per year.
xxii
Workforce growth would be correspondingly higher using the ONS’s high migration variant (280,000 per year over 2018/19 to
2021/22, 245,000 per year thereafter).
xxiii
For example, among men that work, the average work week falls from around 37 hours for the 50-54 year age group to 35 hours for
the 55-59 group, 32 hours for the 60-64 group and 25 hours for the 65-69 group. The decline among women is similar, from 27 hours
per week for the 55-59 age group to 23 hours for the 60-64 age group. Even if we allow for the effects of education attainment, ageing is
likely to reduce average hours slightly (by less than 0.1% per year) over the next 10 years.
xxiv
On average, people aged 55-64 and 65+ years want to work about an hour per week less than at present. Similarly, among people
aged 65 years or over, the share that are outside the workforce but would like to work is down from 1.5% at start of 2015 to just 0.9%
now, the lowest since 2006.
xxv
See Feyrer (2007 and 2008), Aksoy et al (2016), Aiyar et al (2016), Maestas et al (2016), Liu and Westelius (2017), and Jones
(2018).
xxvi
There is evidence that innovation peaks at 40-50 years on average, see Jones (2010), and Nager et al (2016).

It may be that older workers are less willing to change job, or that firms are more reluctant to hire them.
See Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017).
xxix
See, for example Haldane (2018), Ramsden (2018), and Tenreyro (2018).
xxx
Across 16 major industry groups, the correlation between the change in productivity growth and population ageing averages zero. In
regions with above-average ageing in employment and population, manufacturing productivity slowed more than average, while
productivity in construction and financial services slowed less than average. Results are also inconclusive using the 30-49 employment
share, the 60+ population share and 70+ population share.
xxxi
This is consistent with OECD research, see Paccagnella (2016). Median pay among people with tertiary education is about 70%
above that for people of similar age who lack tertiary education. Skirbekk (2003) argues that pay data may not fully reflect the
age-related deterioration in productivity.
xxxii
On average in 2014-18, graduates aged 50-59 years were paid 15% more than graduates aged 30-39 years and 2% more than
graduates aged 40-49 years. Among non-graduates, the 50-59 age group on average were paid 6% more than the 30-39 year age
group and 1% less than the 40-49 year age group.
xxxiii
It is possible that there is some selection bias here, in that people that experience a very large age-related decline in productivity
levels may be unable to find any job and hence will not be in work. This effect is likely to be limited for people aged 50-59 years – for
whom employment rates are not very different to the 40-49 age group (allowing for education) -- but may be more marked for people
above 60 years (for whom employment rates are much lower), and may account for the lower participation rates among this age group.

Lisack et al (2017) show that this lifecycle savings pattern also holds in the US data. See also Cowell et al (2016).

See Hughson et al (2016) and Wong (2018). The effects of a 1pp change in mortgage rates on mortgage payments are smaller for
people with a repayment mortgage rather than an interest-only mortgage. We allow for this, using the NMG survey results that include
mortgage type.

The share of total household wealth that is held by people aged 65+ years has risen from 28% in 2006-08 to 37% in 2014-16, while
the share held by people aged 16-44 years has fallen from 21% to 14%. The share of houses that are owned by people aged 55+ years
has risen from 39% in 1991 to 42% in 2001 and 55% in 2016.

Since 2008, the share of all households with a mortgage has fallen from 36% to 28%, a drop of 8pp. The decline is 13pp (from 51% to
38%) among households aged below 45 years, and 2pp (from 15% to 13%) among households aged over 55 years.

In 2016/17, 34.1% of households in England owned their home with no mortgage (up from 31.4% in 2008-08), while 28.4% owned
their home with a mortgage (down from 36.5% in 2008-09). Source: English Housing Survey.

For example, the NMG survey results suggest that, combining the effects on all households, the total impact on household cashflow
from a 1pp rise in all interest rates has risen from 0.36% in 2016H1 to 0.44% in 2017H2 and 0.51% in 2018H1.
xlvii
It is hard to establish this definitively either way. Estimates of wealth effects on spending vary significantly.

For example through a rapid shrinkage in high productivity sectors with heavy exposure to EU trade, migration flows and disruption
to transport.
