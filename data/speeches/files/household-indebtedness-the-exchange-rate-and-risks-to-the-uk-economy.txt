SUMMARY

1 RISKS FROM GROWING HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS

While the current rate of growth in household debt is clearly unsustainable, the
vulnerability of the economy to rising debt can be overstated. Debt servicing ratios
are below average, and the debt-assets ratio has actually fallen over the last decade.
The inflation-adjusted savings ratio is above its long-term historical average, and the
rise in the debt-income ratio might be a by-product of the move to a low inflation
environment. While the rise in debt poses some clear risks, it is important that we do
not exaggerate them.

2 THE EXCHANGE RATE AND FUTURE INSTABILITY – SOME
LESSONS FROM DOWN UNDER
There is a concern that growing household debt must ultimately undermine the
exchange rate, which will then be associated with a sharp rise in inflation and interest
rates, thereby precipitating a crash in house prices and consumption.

There are, though, other possibilities. Both Australia and New Zealand have
experienced significant exchange rate depreciations at a time when household
indebtedness was rising strongly. So far, the impact on consumer price inflation has
been less than would have been suggested by past historical relationships, with
inflation expectations, non-tradeables inflation and unit labour cost growth remaining
benign. Changes in interest rates have been relatively modest, and, over the period,
house prices have grown. Unemployment has continued to fall in New Zealand, and
Australia registered 4% real GDP growth in 2001 despite the global slowdown. The
exchange rate depreciations have aided an improvement in their underlying current
account positions. So far, their experience suggests that we may similarly avoid a
‘bust’, though, of course, we shall need to remain vigilant.

2

3 HIGH DEBT, AN OVERVALUED EXCHANGE RATE AND
APPROPRIATE MONETARY POLICY
Another argument is that the risks posed by debt and the exchange rate should lead
the MPC to hold interest rates higher than is necessary to hit the 2 year-ahead
inflation target. I find this argument to be unconvincing, because such a policy might
lead to an even higher exchange rate, which might exacerbate current imbalances and
potentially increase future inflation volatility. Moreover, a high interest rate policy
might sufficiently weaken the corporate sector such that some future adverse
development could increase unemployment more than would otherwise have been the
case.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last 2 years, the world economy has been subjected to some significant
disturbances. Global share prices fell, notably in the technology-related sectors.
Then, we had the tragic events of September 11, with its associated impact on
confidence.

In recent weeks, sentiment appears to have improved significantly, with a variety of
business confidence surveys displaying a notable rise. The sharp reduction of
inventories that followed the September tragedy obviously could not endure, and, in a
variety of countries, consumption spending remained relatively resilient. Consensus
forecasts for global economic growth have been revised up in recent weeks, and there
are some tentative signs that corporate investment spending in the US may not be as
weak in 2002 as many of us had feared. If the economy-wide capital stock overhang
proves to be a little smaller than the consensus had feared, then it is not implausible to
expect current forecasts for global economic activity to be revised upwards further.
On the other hand, the downside risks to global activity remain. For example, the
recent rise in the oil price is unhelpful, and events might take it rather higher.
However, the resilience of the global economy to the shocks of the last two years has
been awesome.

With the global economy looking better than one might have expected last Autumn, I
intend to devote some time to discussing some of the other key risks confronting the
UK economy – specifically, the growth in household debt and the vulnerability of the
exchange rate.

1 THE GROWTH IN HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS

A great deal of attention has focused recently on the issue of “imbalances” in the UK
economy. Concerns have related to the rather high pace of growth of household
indebtedness, which may be associated with a worsening of the current account deficit
that could eventually trigger a sudden correction in the exchange rate. Any such
move might imply higher future inflation and could lead to a rise in interest rates.
Some believe that this could lead to a ’bust’ with a housing market crash.
4

While the current rate of growth in household debt clearly cannot be sustained
indefinitely, there may be reasons to believe that the concerns about the vulnerability
of the macro-economy to rising household debt might, at this point, be overstated.
There has been a pick-up in recent years in the debt-income ratio in the UK, but, as
highlighted in Table 1A below, its level is not out of line with that in many other
developed economies, and the recent rate of increase has been considerably higher in
some economies (eg Australia and New Zealand). 1 Further, unlike in the US,
household debt servicing ratios have been relatively stable over the last three years
despite the rise in debt (Chart 1), and are still below their long-term average.

In order for the household debt servicing ratio to return to the peak seen in the early1990s, debt would have to almost double at current levels of interest rates or, at the
current level of debt, interest rates would need to increase to almost 11%. Of course,
it is possible to envisage circumstances where interest rates might need to rise
considerably, but, in my personal view, the rise in the debt-income ratio should make
us more cautious about doing so.

1

Of course, the fact that the rise in the debt-income ratio may have been greater in other countries is
not necessarily reassuring – see, eg Brash (2002) for some of the risks it poses to the New Zealand
economy.

It is also worth observing that the debt – financial assets ratio in the UK has fallen
during the 1990s from just over a third in 1990 to around one-quarter in 2001. (See
Table 1B) In this context, note that the debt-assets ratio in the UK is in line with the
average ratio for the G6, and that, indeed, the debt-assets ratio rose during the 1990s
in some other countries including Germany, Australia and New Zealand.

6

The fall in the household savings ratio to a level below its historical average has also
led to some concern about future consumption prospects. But, the recent strength of
consumption may, at least in part, be due to a low inflation environment. First, there
is a measurement issue. The inflation adjusted savings ratio is above its historical
average (Chart 2). 2 Second, there is a behavioural issue. It is plausible that the
absence of index-linked mortgages implies that consumers react more significantly to
fluctuations in nominal interest rates (with real interest rates held constant) than
standard economic theory might imply. Certainly, back in the 1970s, economic
forecasters were initially surprised by the weakness of consumption when inflation
rose. The absence of index-linked mortgages implied that current mortgage servicing
costs rose steeply as inflation increased, and many consumers were forced to cut back
even though the real duration of the loan fell, 3 ie the so-called front-end loading
problem. Now, the significant fall in inflation has led to the situation being reversed,
whereby the fall in current mortgage servicing costs has enabled households who
were previously liquidity constrained to consume more now. If this hypothesis is
valid, one might expect lower inflation and nominal interest rates to be associated
with a gradual rise in the debt-income ratio to a new, higher equilibrium level, at
which point this process could come to a halt relatively autonomously.

However, one concern that some of us have is that not all consumers are able to
distinguish between “real” and “nominal” interest rates. Consequently, it is possible
that some individuals might, in the years to come, be surprised by the fact that debt
repayments as a fraction of income do not fall as quickly as they did in a high
inflation period. At that point, one would expect consumption to adjust, though it is
unlikely to be abrupt.

Also, spending on durables and semi-durables has grown at a higher rate as compared
to overall consumption over the last year. Thus, the share of consumption accounted
for by durables has surged recently, perhaps because of a desire by households to
invest in physical rather than financial assets or because of falls in the relative price of
these goods. Durables and semi durables provide consumers with a flow of services
2

The very low inflation-adjusted savings ratios in the 1970s is partially attributable to unanticipated
inflation. However, note that the inflation-adjusted savings ratio was also low in the 1960s.

See, eg. Flemming (1976) for an excellent discussion of this issue.

over a number of future periods, unlike non- durables which are consumed
immediately. Data on household consumption record the value of new purchases. A
more appropriate measure of consumer spending might adjust for this by dividing
spending on durables and semi durables by the life time of those goods. A saving
ratio computed using such a measure of consumption shows a less marked fall than
the conventional ratio.
Turning to the housing market, the house price to average earnings ratio is
considerably higher than its historical average (Chart 3) and this, at first sight, is
worrisome. However, the ratio of house prices to total personal disposable income is
only marginally higher than its post-1970s average and is considerably lower than
during the late-1980s. This might be a better guide to market valuation as, for
example, it does allow for dual-income households. It must be noted that even on this
measure, London house prices look stretched. But some other measures of housing
affordability – for example, the interest cost of servicing a mortgage relative to
income – remain below their historical average (Chart 4), for the UK and London
alike. This is obviously intimately related to our earlier discussion about the effects
of low inflation. In the absence of index-linked mortgages, it is likely that lower
inflation might boost the equilibrium house price-earnings ratio because it reduces the
initial cashflow burden associated with a mortgage. Hence, at least some of the recent
rise in house prices may well represent an adjustment to a new equilibrium. Having
said that, of course, the current high rate of increase in house prices clearly cannot be
sustained for very long, and we shall remain vigilant.

Although I have offered some reasons as to why some of those who fret over the level
of household indebtedness might be overstating the risks to the economy, there is no
getting away from the fact that the current rate of growth of consumer debt is
obviously unsustainable. Moreover, if things were to go wrong for some other reason,
and unemployment were to rise, the high levels of household debt could make the
situation worse than it might otherwise have been.

Of course, we shall need to continue to monitor the situation.

THE EXCHANGE RATE AND FUTURE INSTABILITY

A THE KEY ISSUES

A recurrent theme in popular discussion of the economy is that the higher current
account deficit that is associated with rising household indebtedness will eventually
undermine the exchange rate, which might then fall abruptly, leading the MPC to
increase interest rates rapidly, thereby causing consumption and house prices to crash.
Hence, some argue that it would be better for the MPC to set interest rates now at a
level (ie higher) to reflect the risk of an exchange rate fall, that is they are implicitly
recommending a strategy that implies an undershoot of the inflation target if sterling
does not, in fact, fall. This is justified by asserting that the economy would be better
placed to absorb the inflationary shock associated with an exchange rate depreciation
if we were already starting below target.

The February 2002 Inflation Report published a forecast that allowed for the mean
inflation forecast to be about 0.4% higher at a two-year horizon to reflect a risk that

9

the exchange rate might fall, 4 with some members also inclined to place weight on
this forecast for policy purposes today.
As I have said before, 5 I am uneasy about the above arguments. First, the relationship
between current account deficits and the exchange rate is far from straightforward. In
recent years, commentators who have pointed to a rising US current account deficit as
a reason to sell the dollar have been repeatedly confounded by a tendency for the US
currency to rise further. Second, while I do not set much store by consensus forecasts
of the exchange rate, it is notable that they have actually risen significantly over the
last year (from a long-term forecast for the ERI of 93 a year ago, to a revised forecast
of 102 now), and now point to only a modest depreciation from current levels (around
106). In any case, forecasts for the sterling exchange rate have, since late 1996,
consistently predicted a depreciation – a period during which the exchange rate has
actually appreciated by over 25%.

Given the difficulties of exchange rate prediction, a relevant consideration is whether
one thinks that there is time to react to an exchange rate fall if and when it occurs.
Recall that our remit states that –

“The framework is based on the recognition that the actual inflation rate will on
occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Attempts to
keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable
volatility in output.”6
This might permit the MPC to be less worried about a temporary overshoot of the
target that might be caused by an exchange rate fall if and when it occurs.

In any case, the appropriate policy response to a fall in sterling will depend on why
the exchange rate falls, therefore making it rather risky to be pre-emptive. An
exchange rate depreciation could lead to a change in relative import prices without

4

Note that the calibration assumed a probability of 10% per quarter of a fall in the real exchange rate
of 5%, which, in the model, is assumed to lead to a rise in inflation of as much as 1.6% if the exchange
rate did fall. This is a rather higher rate of passthrough into inflation than was seen in Australia and
New Zealand in recent years – a subject to which I return below.

10

necessarily increasing the overall inflation rate, though one would obviously need to
monitor the situation carefully, looking especially for signs of indirect, second round
effects.

These considerations are perhaps best illustrated by way of historical examples.
Therefore, I turn to the recent experience of some other countries.

B THE EXCHANGE RATE AND INFLATION – SOME LESSONS FROM
DOWN UNDER
Both Australia and New Zealand have experienced significant exchange rate
depreciations in recent years, with falls of 36% and 40% respectively versus the US
dollar since their 1996 peaks (Chart 5). 7 Both countries have inflation-targeting
central banks, and it is notable that while CPI inflation has risen in both countries, the
extent of the rise has been relatively modest (Chart 6), especially if one allows for the
other important factors having a transient impact on measured inflation. 8 For
example, in New Zealand, although measured CPI inflation rose to 4% at the end of
2000, stripping out the effects of petrol (international oil prices rose rapidly in 2000)
and excise duty on tobacco would lead to a rather lower inflation rate of 2.7%. 9

Indeed, research carried out at the two central banks has suggested that the impact of
the fall in the exchange rate on consumer price inflation has been rather less than
would have been suggested by past historical relationships. 10 For example, Debelle
and Wilkinson (2002) argue that -

“the effect of exchange rate changes on inflation has become more muted ….. the
Australian economy has become more resilient to temporary price level shocks”
(page 30).

7

The falls in the effective exchange rate indices from their 1997 peaks is somewhat smaller at around
23% and 28% respectively though, since their exchange rates have recovered in recent months, the
peak-to-trough falls were larger.
8
The measure of inflation for Australia in Chart 6 adjusts for the impact of the Goods and Service Tax
in 2000.
9
See the RBNZ Monetary Policy Statement, March 2001.
10
I have greatly benefited from very useful conversations with various officials at the RBA and the
RBNZ, though, of course, the views expressed here are entirely my own and do not necessarily reflect
those of either central bank.

Similarly, Hampton (2001) asserts that -

“Earlier internal research done at the RBNZ ….. suggested that the long run import
price pass-through coefficient was around 0.25 to 0.30. The much lower level of 0.15
estimated in this paper is consistent ..… (with the observation) that the recent
depreciation in the exchange rate has not resulted in increases in consumer prices as
large as we had expected.” (page 14)

It is, of course, possible that the exchange rate pass-through has become more
protracted than before – only time will tell.

In both countries, measures of medium-term inflation expectations have been
relatively well anchored (see Chart 7) despite the fall in the exchange rate (and,
indeed, in 2000, a rise in oil prices and indirect taxes). In both countries, market
expectations of medium-term inflation have remained close to the target band in
recent years. Hence, although the measured inflation rate of tradeables goods rose
after the exchange rate fell (Chart 8) the behaviour of non-tradeables inflation
(Chart 9) and unit labour cost growth (Chart 10) has been relatively benign. Note that
inflation has remained low after a significant exchange rate decline, although
unemployment continued to fall in New Zealand, and only rose modestly in Australia

12

(Chart 11). Indeed, the exchange rate depreciations occurred at a time when
unemployment rates were low by recent historical standards.

The RBA actually cut interest rates during the 1997-98 exchange rate depreciation.
While interest rates went up somewhat in both countries in the wake of the 1999-2000
exchange rate depreciations, the rhetoric of the respective central banks suggests that
they were not responding to the direct price level effects, but only to the indirect
effects on demand, inflation expectations, wages, etc, so that the actual rise in interest
rates was not out of line with the recent amplitude of interest rate changes (Chart 12).
As we noted in Section 1 above, consumer debt-income ratios have actually continued
to grow very significantly in both countries, and there has been no “hard landing” in
their respective housing markets (Chart 13), though it must be recognised that debtincome ratios were starting from lower levels relative to what currently prevails in the
UK. With domestic inflation having reacted only a little to the significant exchange
rate depreciations, the international competitiveness of the two economies has
improved, and this has been reflected in an improvement in their respective current
account positions (Chart 14). The latter is especially significant given that both
economies have grown rather faster than the G7 aggregate over the last year, with the
Australian economy registering a growth rate of 4% despite the weak global
economy.

It is also worth noting that neither central bank raised interest rates because they
expected an exchange rate fall and there was, therefore, no deliberate attempt to
“prepare the economy” for such an eventuality. Instead, they waited for it to actually
fall, and even then appear to have proceeded cautiously because of their uncertainty
about the magnitude and timing of the impact on inflation.

On balance, I am much encouraged by the recent experience of the Australasian
economies following their recent exchange rate depreciations. There are many who,
in the British context, are pessimistic about the UK economy if a large fall in
sterling’s effective exchange rate were to occur. Until now, the experience of
Australia and New Zealand would suggest that these economies were able to cope
with very large exchange rate changes without any significant problems. 11

Of course, it remains possible that things might yet go wrong over there. If, say,
headline inflation rates were to stay at or above the high end of the normal range, they
11

It may, of course, be that many of us have been using the wrong models to analyse the effect of an
exchange rate on inflation. McCallum and Nelson (2001), in contrasting their model to others, argue
that - “In general, our model provides little support for inflation-targeting central banks to be driven to

15

may yet have a significant impact on inflation expectations, so we shall have to ‘wait
and see’ vis-à-vis the final verdict regarding their recent experiences.

Moreover, there may be good reasons as to why the UK’s experience with a
significant exchange rate fall might be less benign. Note that the 1997-98 fall in the
currencies of Australia and New Zealand coincided with the so-called ‘Asian crisis’,
which implied that there was a significant deflationary impulse from abroad helping
to keep inflation in check though recall that Australian interest rates were actually
reduced during that episode. The reaction of inflation to an exchange rate fall during
a period when the international economy was buoyant might have been different,
though in this regard, the failure of inflation to rise much as a result of exchange rate
effects during 2000 is quite encouraging.

A key common feature of their success in managing the adjustment to a large
exchange rate fall was that inflation expectations remained low, perhaps in part
because the respective central banks said that they would remain vigilant and respond
forcefully to any signs that the exchange rate falls were beginning to spill over into
higher medium-term inflation expectations.

Obviously, the appropriate response to an exchange rate fall depends on why it has
occurred. If, for example, there were a domestic inflationary shock which happens to
drive the exchange rate down, then, it would be important to respond aggressively to
prevent it from being embedded into inflation expectations.

It would be both foolish and imprudent to ignore the very real risks confronting the
UK economy because of rising household indebtedness, a deteriorating current
account deficit and an ‘overvalued’ exchange rate. However, as I have argued above,
all these features of our current problems also confronted Australia and New Zealand
in recent years, and yet, at least until now, there has been no ‘bust’ there. Hence,
while not wishing to sound complacent, their experience suggests that,
notwithstanding the considerable risks confronting us, we may similarly avoid a
‘bust’, though, of course, we shall need to remain vigilant.
large increases in interest rates in the face of even significant exchange rate depreciations, unless the

16

3 HIGH CONSUMER DEBT, AN OVERVALUED EXCHANGE RATE AND
APPROPRIATE MONETARY POLICY
It has, as we noted above, been argued that the high levels of consumer indebtedness
and an overvalued exchange rate should lead the MPC to be ‘prudent’, and to hold
interest rates higher than is necessary to hit the 2 year-ahead inflation target. The
argument is that by allowing inflation to modestly undershoot on a two-year horizon,
one might avoid a much larger deviation from target at some future date. 12 I have
discussed this argument at some length in the past, 13 so I shall be necessarily brief
here.

If interest rates are held higher than otherwise, other things being equal, this leads to
the sterling exchange rate being higher than it would otherwise be. This has the effect
of potentially exacerbating the imbalances today, as a higher current value of the
exchange rate leads to a higher trade deficit.
Relatedly, for many years, students of macroeconomics have, therefore, been taught 14
that a central bank which is interested in stable output and inflation should ‘lean
against the wind’ of significant asset price movements if these disturbances do not
reflect underlying economic fundamentals.
About two years ago, some academic work 15 that I was associated with showed that
this basic insight was still valid in the context of a more general model of the
economy currently used at the Bank of England, ie if one were interested in
minimising the volatility of inflation around an inflation target, then, the correct
policy response to a high, overvalued exchange rate is to keep interest rates a little
lower than what might be necessary to achieve a 2 1/2% inflation rate at a two-year

depreciations are associated with large increases in output above potential.” (p 26)
12
ie, this can be interpreted as a desire to reduce future inflation volatility.

time-horizon. This is primarily because the alternative of a somewhat higher interest
rate is likely to exacerbate and prolong the “overvaluation” of sterling, which would
then increase the volatility of future inflation.

Holding interest rates higher than may be necessary to achieve the two year-ahead
target might also hurt the corporate sector, through, both the direct interest rate
channel and through the indirect exchange rate channel. A worsening of the financial
position of the corporate sector could leave it rather more vulnerable to adverse
events. One could envisage circumstances where if interest rates were higher than is
necessary to achieve the two year-ahead inflation target, then this would weaken the
corporate sector so much such that an unhelpful development increases
unemployment by more than would otherwise have been the case, which, in turn,
leads to a greater degree of retrenchment by the household sector than may otherwise
have occurred.

Hence, in both examples, the desire to reduce inflation volatility by holding interest
rates higher today could actually result in an increase in future inflation volatility.
Of course, I do not exclude the possibility that there would be circumstances in
which it might be appropriate to respond to imbalances in the household sector. One
could, for example, envisage a situation where it might be appropriate to increase
interest rates because it was felt that a house price “bubble” might destabilise the
economy. I should re-emphasise that one would only be worrying about the bubble
because of its implications for future inflation volatility, which is entirely consistent
with our remit. In my judgement, taking the UK as a whole, we are not in that
situation as yet, but one must remain vigilant. Even in that situation difficult
judgements about whether we could easily communicate what we were doing would
be a highly relevant consideration.

Finally, to conclude, I have tried to argue today that although the UK economy faces
considerable risks, it is important that we do not exaggerate them. Nevertheless, I
promise you that we shall attempt to remain vigilant to the evolving risks.
