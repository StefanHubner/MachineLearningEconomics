It is a great honour to be the closing speaker at your conference today. I shall use the opportunity to update you
on progress with the Financial Stability Board's work on the resolution of distressed financial institutions.1

Deposit insurance, stability and competition

Although it has rarely been centre stage in recent debates, deposit insurance in fact plays a key role in the
international efforts to build solid foundations for global finance. Eighty-odd years ago the US introduced deposit
insurance to underpin confidence in a commercial banking system that was threatening to unravel. In recent
years, the UK has not been alone in learning the hard way that it is not enough simply to have a deposit insurance
system. Retail depositors will run from a troubled bank if they are not confident that they will have access to their
transactions balances quickly.

The general public need to know about the deposit insurance system, understand it, and be able to rely on rapid
payout by the Deposit Insurer in the event of a bank’s failure. With the encouragement of the Bank of England,
the UK’s bank supervisors – today at the FSA, from next year at a new Prudential Regulation Authority within the
Bank – are requiring deposit takers to advertise prominently the availability and terms of deposit insurance, in
every branch, on every ATM, on every key webpage.

Further, crucially, the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme will ensure they can deliver rapid payout,
ideally within 7 days. This requires banks to hold more information about their depositors than it seems they
would choose on their own. It is perfectly reasonable for society to demand this.
Once those conditions are met,2 the deposit insurance regime has the potential to revolutionalise retail banking.
By assuring retail depositors of safety, new banks should find it easier, other things being equal, to establish a
deposit base, lowering barriers to entry into banking. Later I shall come to who pays for this: it isn't government
and the taxpayer but the industry itself.

Deposit insurance and resolution

But we know from experience that liquidation and payout to insured depositors can be a seriously inferior way of
handling the failure of some deposit-takers. That is because liquidation can entail a destruction of value,
disruption to the provision of services, and other spillovers to the rest of financial system. Some of that can be
avoided if, instead, we are able to transfer the insured deposit book and some good assets to another bank (or
other purchasers). In resolution circles, this is known as ‘purchase and assumption’ or P&A. Bridge banks are
often discussed in this context but they are not really another resolution strategy. Rather, they are a holding
mechanism while a search for a buyer for part of the business is undertaken. So, under established practices in

the USA and elsewhere, the basic non-liquidation resolution strategy has been to break up a bank into a good and
bad bit; and effect a sale of the good and economically critical parts. In many major jurisdictions, including the UK,
this is typically aided by an injection of resources by the Deposit Insurer, up to but not beyond what it would have
expected to pay out to insured depositors in a liquidation. The most critical services – basically transactions
deposits and payments – are thereby maintained.

Whether under ‘liquidation and payout’ or ‘purchase and assumption’, uninsured depositors and other creditors,
including bondholders, take losses after equity is exhausted. That includes the Deposit Insurer, which becomes a
claimant creditor in the liquidation or administration of the rump of the business. It therefore stands to lose money
if there is a realised loss that is not absorbed by more junior creditors. Any such loss is later recouped by the
Deposit Insurer via a levy on the surviving insured banks.

It is important to underline that for banks funded by insured deposits, some of the costs of failure will fall on their
peers. Over time, I suspect that that will increase pressure for a funded deposit-guarantee scheme with
risk-based levies. That avoids defaulting banks getting off scott free, and has banks contributing to the deposit
insurance system when times are good rather than only when under pressure.

I realise that I am telling this conference of deposit insurance agency experts things you already know! I am doing
so because they are highly relevant to where I am going on the development of resolution strategies for coping
with the failure of the world’s largest and most complex banks, and how Deposit Insurance might fit into that
endeavour.

Resolution regimes for systemically important firms

The objective is, of course, to get to a position where public money is never used to provide solvency support for a
failing bank, however large or complex.

To be clear, this is emphatically not just about preserving payments and transactions-deposit services. If we did
only that, we will all be sitting around at some point in the future saying how appalling it was that a big dealer had
failed and that they had had to be rescued in order to avoid a seizure in the capital markets.

So where are we on resolution regimes? It is worth saying upfront that we recognise that it is not easy for
banks to assist the authorities in drawing up resolution plans when the full resolution legislation is not yet in
place; it will matter enormously exactly what the legislation says. A year ago, the G20 Leaders endorsed an
international standard – the FSB’s Key Attributes – that lays down what resolution regimes need to look like
in the different jurisdictions around the world. It’s now a matter of countries putting those regimes into place.
The US has largely done so through Dodd Frank. Europe is on the verge of doing so. It has a draft directive
on recovery and resolution which seeks to implement the FSB standard very faithfully. This will be an

enormous step forward. I think Asia will then follow that pattern, to the extent that it hasn't done so already.
The FSB’s Standards’ Implementation Committee currently has an exercise underway, led by
Martin Gruenberg, Acting Chairman of the FDIC, and of course chair of the IADI, to review progress on
legislating the Key Attributes. Their report is due to be published in the first quarter of 2013.

A broadly common statutory framework will help home and host authorities work together on resolution planning.
To that end, Crisis Management Groups (CMGs) are now in place for nearly all global systemically important firms
(or G-SIFIs as they are now commonly called), with the goal of reviewing firms' proposed recovery plans and
developing resolution strategies for them. Firm-specific cross-border cooperation agreements (or CoAgs) are also
being developed, setting out roles and responsibilities of the home and host authorities, clarifying how they will
share information, and how they will cooperate to implement their preferred resolution strategy. If home and host
authorities are not going to cooperate, we need to flush that out ahead of time, rather than stumble into it in the
moment of desperation. There's a good deal of cultural change entailed here. In the past, supervisors have
sometimes seemed during peacetime to be more committed to cooperating than they have been prepared to live
up to when it most mattered.

A forthcoming FSB consultation paper on developing resolution strategies

But we – the FSB – realise that more guidance is needed.

Although not of central interest to this audience, resolution isn't just about banks, and so we are planning to
elaborate on how the Key Attributes should be applied to, for example, central counterparties, insurers, and the
client assets held by prime brokers, custodians and others.

More relevant to today's conference, following the FSB's recent Plenary meeting in Tokyo we announced that in
the next few weeks we will issue a consultative paper on resolution planning and, in particular, on resolution
strategies.

The paper, drawn up by a subcommittee led by Christine Cumming of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, will
cover three areas. The first is Recovery Triggers and Stress Scenarios used in recovery planning. Firms need to
ensure that triggers are not linked mechanically to metrics that lag behind their true financial condition – a problem
with some previous early-intervention frameworks. Recovery actions must start sufficiently early. But care must
be taken to avoid markets overacting to the fact of such actions being taken. That is not easy.

Second, the consultative paper will outline a possible framework for national authorities to use when identifying
the critical functions and support services of firms that need to be sustained in distressed conditions. What
matters here is focusing on those services that are vital to the economy.

The third, and most important, area of consultation is about the development of Resolution Strategies and
Operational Resolution Plans. This guidance aims to capture the main issues that authorities should address. It
draws on two stylised approaches to resolution: a so-called ‘single point of entry’ approach, under which
resolution of a whole group is executed, primarily by the home authority and mainly at the level of the parent or
holding company; and, secondly, a ‘multiple point of entry’ approach whereby co-ordinated actions are taken by a
number authorities along national, regional or functional lines. There is, of course, a spectrum between those two
poles.

Identifying the resolution strategy that is most likely best suited to each specific firm is very important. The
strategy must be relatively easy to understand – a strategy that cannot be explained concisely to top officials in
central banks and regulators is not a strategy at all. But although authorities should try to identify a preferred
strategy and should be as transparent as possible, I should caution that what turns out to be the best approach in
the event of distress will depend on the circumstances. The suggestion of a ‘Presumptive Path’, being aired by
some in the market, is somewhat unrealistic, at least in its strongest form. Public authorities with statutory
obligations to maintain stability cannot bind themselves to detailed strategies that in the event might not work as
well as an alternative.

At the planning stage, whether a single- or a multiple-point-of-entry strategy looks more feasible will depend upon
a group’s organisational and financial structure. It is likely that some groups will need to adapt themselves in
order to remove impediments to resolution.

Much of that will be case by case. But some general policies are also emerging. Here in the UK, the government
is requiring the domestic retail banking business of the largest banking groups to be ring-fenced. And for the EU,
Erkki Liikanen has produced an important report on the structure of banks which would involve essentially
ring-fencing the trading business.

Both of these approaches, which are similar in many respects, work with the

grain of the FSB’s approach to resolution.

Single-point of entry resolution: bail-in of the debt of the top company

The central principle running through this whole endeavour is that after equity is exhausted, losses should
fall next on uninsured debt holders, in the order they would take losses in a standard bankruptcy or
liquidation process. Although all resolution strategies have that effect, it is the particular focus of what has
come to be called ‘bail-in’. I should perhaps say that bail-in isn’t about identifying a special type of bond that
can be written down or converted. ‘Bail-in’ is a verb not a noun. It’s about giving the authorities the tools,
the powers, to effect a restructuring of the capital and liabilities of a bank that isn’t toxic all the way through;
as such it will be recognisable to specialists as broadly akin to the US Chapter 11 system for business
reconstructions, but speeded up for the exigencies of banking.

Bail-in is not unique in putting losses on bondholders. All resolution tools do that. The distinguishing
characteristic of bail-in, as a resolution tool, is that it applies losses upfront based upon a valuation rather
than at the end of a liquidation of assets. As such, it prospectively avoids an unnecessary destruction of
value.

For those groups that issue debt from the holding company and downstream the proceeds to operating
subsidiaries, it should be possible to bail in debt at the holding company and recapitalise distressed parts of
the group. Where necessary, those distressed subsidiaries could be recapitalised by bailing-in – ie writing
down and/or converting into equity – intergroup debt owed to the parent. The host authorities of those
operating companies should in principle be prepared to go along with that kind of operation provided that the
home country engenders the necessary trust and takes account of the need to maintain stability around the
world not just in its immediate neighbourhood.

Deposit insurance schemes and bail-in: multiple point of entry resolution

We should not, however, assume a monolithic approach to resolution. It is not a case of one size fits all.
What I have described could work for banking groups that issue plenty of debt out of a top company. It
would not work so easily for groups operating commercial banks around the world that are funded to a very
large extent from insured deposits. In a hypothetical extreme case, if they haven’t issued bonds, then there
would be no bond holders to bail in.

It has become fairly common to say that such groups should be resolved on a regional basis, ie broken up.
Maybe. But even if that is correct, ‘break it up’ hardly amounts to resolution plan. What happens to the
broken-up parts? Under a ‘breakup’ strategy, a plan is needed for all of the parts, both distressed and
undistressed. That can't be a free for all. Indeed, it is worth underlining that, under the FSB Standard,3 it is
the responsibility of the home authorities of the group to ensure that a group-wide resolution plan exists.
There is no ducking that. It removes an ambiguity that has quietly haunted banking authorities for decades,
including in the UK.

Imagine an international commercial banking group whose operations in various jurisdictions are both big
and complex. Good subsidiaries might be sold or floated off. But that won’t be possible for the bankrupt
parts of the group. The realisation of the assets via a standard liquidation of those subsidiaries would be
liable to destroy a lot of value, creating disorder that could spill over to other jurisdictions and possibly
globally. Such subsidiaries need to be resolved. That could be via bail-in of their bondholders and other
creditors. But what happens if there are not enough bonds in issue to absorb all of the losses and
recapitalise the operation? A way of cutting through that would be for each Deposit Insurer to be bailed in.
Rather than a Deposit Insurer having to wait to discover its losses until the end of the process of a potentially
destructive realisation of the bank's assets, it would hear up front how much it had lost. Its losses should be

smaller that way. And it might gain a stake in a surviving business, which it could sell once conditions had
calmed. This approach could, if necessary, be applied in different regions to different distressed subsidiaries
of the group.

I must stress that in no way does any of this dilute the protection to insured deposits.

It puts losses to bondholders and also transfers them to the surviving parts of the various local banking
systems standing behind each local Deposit Insurer. But, as I have outlined, so do other resolution
techniques that draw up on the Deposit Insurers’ resources. ‘Liquidation and payout’ would entail much
bigger losses for the Deposit Insurers and thus for other banks.

Work is underway on how to operationalise this strategy. It requires active cooperation amongst home and
host authorities.

Recovery & Resolution planning: making it happen

Indeed, a lot of work is underway, some of it publicly, some of it with firms, some of it quietly in the
background. This is top level stuff. It isn’t about writing 3,000 or 30,000 page essays. It is at its heart about
a few regulators getting together with the top management of the firms and saying this is what we would plan
to do to you if the only alternative was liquidation, and working out how to operationalise that strategy. That
is something the key countries, the key governments, have every reason in the world to co-operate on. In
the FSB, we are putting in place a process where the most senior officials will talk to each other to reassure
themselves on the resolvability of globally significant firms. From that will follow detailed operational
planning, and requirements to remove impediments to executing resolution strategies.

And flipping from my global hat to my domestic hat, at the Bank of England we have been working closely
with the FDIC on how we would operationalise resolution strategies in a cross-border setting.

You shouldn’t doubt that this will happen. Don't listen to siren voices who question our capability or will.

Financial protectionism and the FSB agenda

Which brings me, in conclusion, to a broader point. The international authorities are committed to
maintaining global finance – global capital markets, the free flow of capital across borders. We are not trying
to create a new order that incorporates financial protectionism. On the contrary: the balkanisation of finance
would cut against the extraordinary historical changes towards a much more globalised real economy.

But allowing a fragile financial system to persist would also be a threat to globalisation. In fact, it has to be
recognised that around the world domestic authorities have been putting in place defensive measures,

mostly below the radar of commentators, over the past few years. This comes back to the use of public
money. A world in which public money is used to bail out banks or dealers, is a world in which balkanisation
is likely because the authorities that deploy public money are accountable to domestic tax payers – people
with votes in their jurisdiction – and to nobody else. But by delivering the FSB’s global agenda – not only on
resolution, but more widely – we will significantly reduce, if not remove, the need for some of those
balkanising tendencies. By making finance safe and orderly failure possible, I think we can take off the stage
the most basic force towards balkanisation. The stakes are high.
