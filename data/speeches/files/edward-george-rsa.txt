I’ve had a long-time interest in the RSA. I was honoured to be elected as a fellow in
1986. But this is the first time I’ve participated in one of your programmes.
The Society, unusually, brings together people from different backgrounds and
disciplines – across the arts to the sciences, but with a common interest in social and
economic progress in the broadest sense. That diversity, but also commonality, of
interest is reflected in the RSA Journal, which I find a fascinating read – whenever I
get the time. It’s reflected, too, in your lecture program so that I find myself slotted in
between a lecture entitled “The feel good factor”, on a medical theme, and another
entitled “Chaos is good for you!” describing a creative approach to business
management!
In fact I have been invited to talk about the “Monetary Challenges” we are currently
facing – and, when you’ve heard what I have to say, you may feel that this
juxtapositioning is not wholly inappropriate.
But let me begin by explaining what it is that we are trying to do through monetary
policy at the Bank of England, and why.
For much of the first half of my 40-year career at the Bank of England, the emphasis
of macro-economic policy as a whole was on short-term demand management
designed to manage the perceived trade-off between growth and employment, on the
one hand, and inflation and a manageable balance of payments position, on the other.
Monetary policy was used in conjunction with fiscal policy and supported with
various forms of direct control to pump up demand, when the economy declined and
unemployment rose, until inflation and the balance of payments threatened to get out
of hand, at which point all the policy levers were thrown into reverse. It was a recipe
for short-termism throughout our economy.
We gradually learned from experience – perhaps more slowly in this country than
some others – that there is no trade-off between growth and stability in the medium
and longer term, and that, in managing demand – which of course we continue to do –
we needed to pay far more attention to the underlying, supply-side, capacity of the
economy to meet that demand. We came to recognise that direct controls merely
addressed the symptoms of instability rather than its causes. We realised increasingly
that fiscal policy was not well suited to the task of short-term demand management,
and needed to be constrained within prudent limits if debt levels were to be
sustainable in the medium- and longer-term. And this left a more distinctive and
clearly defined role for monetary policy as the primary instrument for maintaining
broad balance consistently over time between aggregate demand and underlying
supply.
All this has become the accepted wisdom just about everywhere.
Since 1992 in this country the explicit objective of monetary policy has been to
achieve stability defined in terms of a target for retail price inflation. And since 1997
the Bank of England – through the Monetary Policy Committee – has been delegated
responsibility for setting short-term interest rates with the consistent aim of hitting the

2

Government’s symmetrical 2½% inflation target (on a precisely defined measure of
retail price inflation – RPIX).
Now the reason we’ve been set that task is not – as some people imagine – because
either we or the Government think that consistently low inflation is the be all and end
all of economic life. It is because we learned from our earlier experience that
consistently low inflation is a necessary (though not in itself a sufficient) condition for
the sustained growth of output of the economy as a whole, for high levels of
employment, and for rising living standards, which are more fundamentally the things
that we are all seeking to achieve.
“Stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth” has become the universal
central-banking credo.
So our objective – and the reasons for it – could not be clearer. But meeting that
objective is not as straightforward as it may sound. The reason, of course, is that
there is no simple, direct, link between our essential instrument – the short-term
interest rate – and our objective, the rate of inflation.
Interest rates essentially affect the demand side of the economy. They do not directly
influence the supply side, which depends upon a whole host of structural
characteristics of the economy which are largely beyond the direct reach of monetary
policy. What we have to do in managing short-term interest rates is to keep overall
demand growing broadly in line with the underlying – sustainable – supply-side
capacity of the economy as a whole to meet that demand. In other words we are
trying to maintain overall, macro-economic, stability in a much broader sense, in the
medium- and longer- and not just the short-term; and the Government’s inflation
target is the criterion against which our success, or otherwise, in achieving that
broader macro-economic stability is to be measured.
Our problem is that we don’t know with any great precision or confidence exactly
what is happening on the supply-side – that’s to say precisely what rate of growth we
can hope to sustain. We don’t know precisely either what is currently happening, or
what is likely to happen, looking forward over the next couple of years or so, to
overall, aggregate, demand. And we don’t know precisely what the full impact of a
change in interest rates will be on aggregate demand, or how long it will take before
that full impact is felt.
Ours is not a precise science. In fact it’s more of an art than a science. And, although
we bring as much economic and statistical science to bear as we can, we know that
our forecasts, and indeed our policy judgements, are subject to a range of error. They
cannot be accurate to every last digit. We can’t expect to hit the target all the time,
but by consistently aiming to do so (and we do consistently aim to do so looking 2
years or so ahead) we can hope to get reasonably close to the target on average over
time.
I’ll come back in a moment to the objective, and to our experience measured against
it. But perhaps I might digress briefly to make a couple of points about the principle
of delegation of operational responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank.

3

Some people I know had misgivings about that when it was introduced in 1997 on the
grounds that interest rates are intrinsically a matter for elected politicians. But that
neglects the fact that within the present framework in this country the Government
specifies the objective of policy. That is a political decision insofar as there may be a
short-run trade-off between growth and inflation – and the Government delegates only
the technical task of setting interest rates to achieve that objective to the Bank. I’m
bound to say I welcome that distinction because the fact that the Government sets the
target for monetary policy means that it is unambiguously committed to what we are
tasked to do, and that, in turn, helps in some degree to distance the Bank from
political debate.
But there are two necessary consequences of this arrangement.
The first is that you need independent, technical, experts to do the technical job
entrusted to the MPC – not people appointed for their political convictions, nor
representatives of particular economic or social interests. In that respect I think we
have been extremely well served: the members of the Committee have been
invariably well qualified for the technical jobs they’ve had to do; but more than that
they have typically known enough, including about the inevitable uncertainties I have
referred to, to know when they could be reasonably confident in their views and when
they were guessing – as we all have to do at the margin. The Committee has been
divided, generally very narrowly divided, in its forecasts and policy judgements more
often than not since we started. That is both natural and healthy. But what is
important is that the debate has typically been measured and reflective – and
remarkably free of acrimony and dogma. And that to my mind is fundamental to the
strength of the process.
The second corollary is that the MPC process should be transparent and that its
members should be individually and collectively publicly accountable for their
decisions. Transparency is assured by the publication of detailed minutes of our
monthly meetings just two weeks after the event, and by the publication of our
quarterly inflation report. These publications, and the continuous stream of speeches
and interviews all around the country by members of the MPC, ensure broad
accountability to the public at large. We see this as very much in our own interest, as
monetary policy is likely to be more readily accepted – and more effective – if people
generally understand what it is we are doing and why. But, beyond this, we publish
each individual MPC member’s voting decision each month – which they can then be
expected to explain. Our procedures (though not our decisions) are regularly
reviewed by the Bank’s Court of Directors, and reported on to Parliament through the
Bank’s Annual Report. We regularly appear before the Treasury Select Committee of
the House of Commons and the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of Lords.
And, as Chairman of the MPC, I am required to write an open letter to the Chancellor
if inflation strays by more than 1% either side of the 2½% target, explaining why
inflation was adrift, how long the divergence might last, and the action we propose to
take to bring it back on course.
So far as I am aware, taken as a whole, these arrangements provide far greater
transparency of, and greater accountability for, the monetary policy process than
anywhere else in the world.

But let me revert to my main theme of the monetary-policy objective and our
performance against it.
Since an inflation target was first adopted in October 1992, inflation on the target
measure has averaged just 2.6% – and has been more stable than at any time in our
history. Since 1997 when the present target – and accompanying regime – was
introduced, inflation has averaged 2.4% against the 2½% target. And, on the latest
reading RPIX inflation was 2.2% in the year to February.
Now some people have suggested that, because inflation has recently been fairly
consistently below target – albeit marginally below, by less than ½% on average over
the past two years – monetary policy has been unnecessarily restrictive over this
period. They’ve even suggested that we are not behaving ‘symmetrically’ – aiming to
avoid an undershoot, below 2½% as determinedly as we aim to avoid an overshoot,
which is of course what we are tasked to do.
Well, of course, hindsight is a wonderful thing!
Quite frankly I am amazed that we’ve been as consistently close to the inflation target
as we have, and I’m astonished that I have not – or not yet at least – had to write an
open letter to the Chancellor. Quite apart from the more general uncertainties, there
have inevitably been a series of surprises (or “shocks” in the jargon) – including a
persistently stronger than expected exchange rate against the euro, pronounced swings
in the oil price, or varying rates of increase in excise duties, for example, any of
which can have a significant and persistent impact on the out turn. That’s not a matter
of self-justification – it may well be more by luck than judgement; to be honest I’m
more interested in the result. But I am concerned that people should understand that
operating monetary policy is an inevitably imprecise process, and that they should not
expect from it more than it can deliver.
But however that may be, the even better news is that since 1992, stable, low,
inflation has been accompanied by steadily increasing overall output and
employment, and by a progressive fall in the rate of unemployment.
Over the same period, to the fourth quarter of last year, GDP growth averaged just
under 3% a year – which is well above most estimates of our trend rate of 2¼%-2½%.
GDP had in fact grown for 37 successive quarters which is the longest period of
sustained quarter-by-quarter growth we have enjoyed since quarterly records began in
the UK in 1955.
Employment has increased steadily from a low point of 25½ mn people in the Spring
of 1993 to its current level of 28 mn. And the rate of unemployment fell from a peak
of over 10½% on the LFS measure to around 5% last summer; on the claimant count
measure it fell from some 10% to just over 3%, which meant that the number of
people claiming unemployment benefit, at under 950,000, was the lowest for 26 years.
Short-term interest rates are at a 38-year low.
All of that it seems to me gives the lie to a view that was quite widespread a decade
ago, that sustained low inflation would inevitably mean continuous suppression of the

5

real economy. I’d go further myself and suggest that it provides considerable positive
support for the central bankers’ credo.
Now some of you – given what’s been happening to your own businesses, to certain
particular business sectors, and in regions of the country where those sectors are
particularly heavily concentrated – may think that I’ve been living on a different
planet. The problem is – and it is a real problem – that with the best will in the world
macro-economic stability, the stability of the economy as a whole, cannot guarantee
stability at the more micro-economic level: it can not guarantee the prosperity of
every individual business or even of whole business sectors or geographic regions.
Once you look beneath the apparently benign surface of the economy as a whole in
recent years, you find very substantial differences in particular between many
internationally-exposed sectors of the economy – including particularly many
manufacturing businesses – which have recently been having a really tough time, and
other businesses largely serving our domestic market which have been doing pretty
well.
Let me assure you that the MPC is only too well aware of the problem. We receive
regular monthly written reports from the Bank’s 12 regional agencies all around the
country on the state of the economy as seen through the eyes of their 8000 or so
business contacts. That includes reports from John Bartlett our Agent here in
Birmingham and Chris Brown, our Agent for the East Midlands based in Nottingham,
both of whom will be known to many of you. And about half the Agencies by
rotation attend our monthly pre-MPC meeting in London to brief us face to face.
Beyond that each individual MPC member makes regular visits to businesses located
all over the country to see and hear for themselves. All of this plays a vital role in
informing our interpretation of the bare economic and financial statistics. It’s not that
we do not know what’s happening at the micro-economic level, the question is what
can we – what should we – do about it in setting monetary policy?
It has to be said at the outset that some of the pressures businesses are facing are the
result of long-run structural change affecting the global economy. The spread of
international free trade under the auspices of the WTO is undoubtedly a positive
development for all of us at the macro-economic level, but it is an added challenge to
existing producers at the micro-economic level, and this country is not alone in resourcing supplies to some of the transition economies in Eastern Europe or to
emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere. Nor can we – or should we seek to – avoid
the impact of technological change.
But there are two main reasons for the particular pressures recently affecting the
internationally – exposed sectors of our economy: the synchronised economic slow
down over the past year or so in all major industrial countries, on the one hand; and
the puzzling and persistent weakness of the euro in foreign exchange markets not just
against sterling but even more against the dollar, on the other.
It is a striking fact that world trade in goods, which has grown at an average rate of
around 7% since 1990, and grew by over 12% in the year 2000 alone, hardly grew at
all last year! What that has meant for the UK manufacturing sector is that output in
the year to January (the latest month for which we have internationally comparable
data) fell by around 6%, and employment in manufacturing fell by 165,000 people, or

6

by some 4%. (I’m delighted to note, however, that manufacturing output picked up
modestly in February – the first monthly increased since August.) For what it’s
worth, we were not alone in experiencing the earlier decline. Comparable figures
show that manufacturing output fell by over 11% in Japan, and by close to 5% in both
the US and Germany, while manufacturing employment fell by 6½% in Japan and
7½% in the US – that’s to say by more than in this country – although it fell by less
than 2% in Germany.
The frustrating thing is that, with the best will in the world, there was not much that
either we at the Bank, or the UK Government, could have done to ward off the
pressures on UK manufacturing, which had their origins abroad.
That’s fairly obvious where we are talking about the global slowdown – with negative
overall growth last year of about 2% in Japan (fourth quarter on a year earlier) and
close to zero growth in the US and Germany. This compared with growth of just over
1½% in this country – by some margin the highest in G7. We can go to international
meetings and encourage the respective authorities there to stimulate their economies,
but there is nothing that we can do about it directly ourselves.
What we were able to do – given that inflation was marginally below target – was to
try to compensate for that external weakness by stimulating domestic demand here in
the UK. The Bank sought to do this by cutting interest rates to buoy up consumer
spending. And the Government stepped up its own spending, which was helpful
given the international environment. Although we couldn’t avoid an overall
slowdown altogether – the economy on the latest data ground to a halt in the fourth
quarter of last year – we have managed for most of the time to keep the UK economy
as a whole moving forward despite the recession in the internationally-exposed
sectors of manufacturing.
Of course we’d all have been much happier with better balanced growth. Stimulating
domestic demand to offset the external weakness – the only option available to us –
was very much a second best option. It was not without its own risks including the
build-up of household debt and the current exuberance in the housing market. But it
was better than doing nothing at all. That would have meant a much sharper
slowdown, and probably recession, in the economy as a whole. And, given that
inflation was well under control, it would have meant a quite unnecessary loss of
overall output – and income and employment. In effect we took the view that
unbalanced growth was better than no growth.
It is perhaps less obvious that we could not have done more to weaken the exchange
rate. At around $1.40 – 1.50, sterling’s value against the dollar through this period
was not seen by most people even in the internationally – exposed sectors as a
particular problem. The problem – for businesses trading or competing with firms in
the eurozone, our largest trading partner, was the persistent and puzzling weakness of
the euro. Now many people think that we could have caused the pound to fall against
the euro simply by cutting our interest rate somewhat further relative to the interest
rate in the eurozone. But it really isn’t as simple as that. The US has reduced its
interest rate far more aggressively than the ECB over the past year or so, and to well
below the ECB’s rate (to 1.75% as against 3.25%) but the dollar is actually stronger
today against the euro than it was at the start of last year. And the same is true,

7

though to a lesser degree of ourselves: UK interest rates were reduced by 2% from
the beginning of 2001 compared with a fall of 1½% in the eurozone, yet sterling is
stronger against the euro (though weaker against the dollar) than it was to begin with.
I don’t think I can offer you a wholly convincing explanation for the euro’s weakness
since its introduction. It seems to have been driven by capital flows reflecting
expected medium- and longer-term future corporate earnings growth rather than shortterm interest rate differentials, and it is often suggested that these expectations reflect
perceived supply-side rigidities within the eurozone. But whatever the explanation
the resulting strength of sterling against the euro has contributed to the pressure on the
internationally – exposed sectors of our economy, and a stronger euro would, from
my perspective, help us towards better balanced growth in this country. It would also
incidentally facilitate debate about sterling’s possible entry into the single currency, in
the sense that the undoubted attraction of nominal exchange rate certainty vis à vis our
European trading partners, which is a major potential advantage of our adopting the
euro, must depend to some degree on the likely exchange rate at which we might join.
These then are the monetary challenges that we have faced over the recent period.
The question now, of course, is where do we go from here?
There has recently been encouraging evidence – in the US data particularly but also
for example in many of the more forward-looking indicators of European economic
activity – that we are now in the early stages of global recovery. We cannot be sure
that the early momentum will be maintained; nor do we know just how strong the
expansion will prove to be or how long it will last; but the signs are promising, and
indeed far more positive than any of us would have dared to hope just six months or
so ago in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
As it becomes clearer that the international environment really is improving, and that
we really are seeing a sustained pick up in external demand, then we can look forward
to better balanced and generally stronger growth in our own economy.
That will in due course mean that domestic demand growth – and consumer demand
growth in particular – will need to moderate if we are to avoid a build up of
inflationary pressure. It’s quite possible, even still quite likely, that the necessary
moderation of consumer demand – and I emphasise the word moderation – will come
about of its own accord.
And that would be the best possible outcome for our own economy. But if consumer
spending were not in due course to moderate of its own accord, and depending on the
timing and the strength of the recovery abroad, we would clearly need at some point
to consider raising interest rates to bring that moderation about.
But for the time being, and whatever the precise numbers, the overall prospect for the
British economy over the next couple of years is for output growth picking up to
around trend and inflation to around target. And if that is indeed how things turn out,
we will have weathered the international storm as well as anyone could reasonably
have expected.
