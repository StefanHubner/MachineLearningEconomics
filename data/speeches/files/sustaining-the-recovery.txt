Good afternoon! The past six years have been a difficult time for businesses across the country. But at last
there are unmistakable signs that a robust recovery is under way. According to the present vintage of official
data, output has risen in each of the past four quarters, taking the four-quarter growth rate to a healthy 2.7%,
the highest since early 2008. The message from business surveys, such as those produced by the
Chambers of Commerce, is that growth has, if anything, been even stronger. Over the same period, around
400 thousand more people have found work. And consumer price inflation has fallen back to just below our
2% target. So more growth, more jobs, and stable prices – a conjunction we haven’t seen since before the
financial crisis. But though the economic climate has certainly improved, it is still early days. So today I want
to discuss what needs to happen if that recovery is to be sustained and what the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee will be doing to support it.
To date, much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment,
stimulated by a revival in confidence and improved access to secured credit. During 2013, consumer
spending increased by 2.2%, while housing investment – which includes both the construction of new
dwellings and the value added in the facilitation of housing transactions – rose by almost 10%. Together,
these two factors accounted for around two thirds of the rise in activity, though note that is in line with their
overall share in GDP.
This pickup in household spending has not so far been driven in the main by faster growth in incomes: real
household income after tax rose by just 1% in the year to 2013 Q3. Press reports sometimes characterise
the rise in spending as being fuelled by borrowing and so destined to end in tears. This is not really the
case. It is true that unsecured lending growth has picked up over the past year, but the pace of growth is still
well below the levels prevailing during the pre-crisis period. And while there has been an expansion in gross
mortgage lending accompanying higher housing activity, there is little sign that this has been used to release
housing equity in order to finance higher consumer spending.
The rise in spending has, though, been associated with a reduction in the fraction of income that is saved.
This rose sharply in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers as households responded to the
increased uncertainty about income and job prospects by building up extra savings, or reducing their debts,
as a precaution. As that uncertainty dissipated and households began to feel more confident about the
outlook, so the saving rate fell back (Chart 1). There is probably some scope for it to fall a little further, but
continued firm consumption growth really depends on us seeing a pickup in household income growth, of
which I will say more shortly.
There is more scope for housing investment to continue driving growth. Housing starts and the level of
housing transactions are still respectively around 25% and 10% below their averages during the pre-crisis
decade (Chart 2). But the supply of new housing is not as elastic as one would like, because of planning
restrictions and the like. Consequently there is a risk that increased demand for housing ends up mainly in

higher house prices rather than more houses. In turn, if associated with excessive expansion in mortgage
lending, that may create future financial stability risks. For that reason, the Bank’s Financial Policy
Committee, which is charged with maintaining the overall stability of the financial system, is keeping a beady
eye on the housing market.
For the recovery to be both sustained and sustainable, however, we really want to see three things happen.
First, business investment needs to pick up the baton in supporting demand growth. Second, we need to
see a revival in productivity growth, which in turn would sustain both higher real wages and higher profits,
thus supporting continued household and business spending growth. Finally, though perhaps over a longer
time frame, an expansion in net exports is desirable, in order to rebalance the composition of demand and
reduce the UK current account deficit.
Let me say a little about each of these in turn. Business investment fell by almost a third in the recession,
reflecting the generalised collapse in demand, heightened uncertainty and restricted availability of credit.
Although those headwinds have eased considerably, business investment in 2013 was still only just over 1%
above its 2010 level. Now it is not too surprising that business investment has been slow to pick up. That is
typically the case in business cycle recoveries, as businesses will want to use up spare capacity and to be
confident that improved business conditions will persist before they undertake capital expenditures that may
be costly to reverse. And the path of business investment so far looks pretty typical, once one takes account
of the protracted nature of the downturn in activity.
Moreover, there are signs that the desired handoff to business investment is under way. According to the
latest official estimates, business investment rose 8.5% over the past year, while investment intentions
surveys suggest that this revival is likely to continue through this year (Chart 3). And lending and capital
market conditions have improved, especially for larger companies, though some SMEs continue to report
difficulty in accessing credit on reasonable terms. While net lending to companies remains subdued, that
partly reflects lenders running down their commercial property loans; new lending to businesses has picked
up significantly over the past year. In sum, there are reasonable grounds to expect that the handover from
households to businesses will be realised.
As far as the prospects for productivity go, the picture is murkier. A feature of this downturn has been the
unusual weakness of productivity growth. To give you an idea of the scale of the puzzle, output per
person-hour worked is just over 15% below where it would have been if it had simply continued growing at its
pre-crisis average rate (Chart 4). Part, but only a small part, of this shortfall can be traced to the low rate of
business investment and special factors such as the decline in North Sea oil production. A possible
explanation is the presence of overhead labour and the desire to hang on to skilled labour that might be
difficult to replace when demand picked up; the low rate of pay growth will certainly have encouraged this.
Some businesses also tell us that they have had to devote more effort to winning business while demand is

depressed. Finally, the need to repair balance sheets may have led banks both to forbear on delinquent
loans to some weaker businesses while simultaneously inhibiting the extension of new credit to riskier, but
potentially more productive, enterprises.
Now several of these explanations imply that a recovery in demand could be met largely with the existing
workforce. For that reason, we had been expecting the early stages of the recovery to take place with
relatively little new hiring. That is not what we have seen. Instead, employment has risen strongly – up
almost 400 thousand in 2013 – accompanied by a correspondingly modest rise of less than 1% in
productivity.
All this makes a future rebound in productivity seem somewhat less likely than before. Even so, some
acceleration in productivity still seems likely on the back of the recovery in business investment, while a
tightening labour market should also encourage businesses to look for ways to use their labour more
efficiently. Moreover, as the banking system continues to heal and risk aversion subsides, so we can expect
to see some reallocation of resources towards potentially more productive businesses. And, even though we
may not recover much of the ground lost since the onset of the recession, it seems reasonable to believe
that we ought to be able to return to something approaching our pre-crisis average rate of productivity
growth. But there is necessarily uncertainty as to exactly what will happen.
The course of productivity is absolutely central to the durability of the recovery. Rapid productivity growth
would sustain the recovery in investment and make possible a pickup in pay growth, in turn supporting
consumer demand. But if the productivity revival were to fizzle rather than flourish, then so too would the
recovery. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman once remarked, “productivity isn’t
everything, but in the long run it is almost everything”.
Turning lastly to the external position, the United Kingdom has run a persistent trade deficit of the order of
2-3% of GDP since the beginning of the century (Chart 5). In spite of that deficit, our net external asset
position has remained stable and roughly in balance. We managed to achieve this feat by earning more on
our holdings of foreign assets than we paid out to foreigners on their holdings of assets here. In part this is
because much of our assets are equity-like, while foreigners’ holdings here are more debt-like.
Over the past two years, however, our net asset income from abroad has deteriorated sharply, so that our
current account deficit – which comprises not only the trade deficit but also net asset income – averaged
almost 4% of GDP last year. That deterioration appears to be primarily down to a fall in earnings on
European assets, reflecting in particular the cyclical weakness of the euro-area economy. In that case it
might be expected to unwind as the euro area recovers. Even so, it would be unwise to expect that we will
again be able to run the sort of investment income surplus we saw in the years before the crisis. So the
trade deficit in due course needs to decline too.

The pre-requisites for such a switch of demand towards net exports seemed to have been put in place by the
substantial depreciation in sterling that occurred during the financial crisis – sterling fell more than 25%
between the middle of 2007 and the beginning of 2009 (Chart 6). Despite the slowdown in our main export
markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports. The performance of exports –
particularly exports of services – has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing. It may be that this is
just a matter of time – for instance, we are starting to hear stories of businesses bringing back activities that
they had previously off-shored to emerging economies. But any further appreciation of sterling, which has
risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of
facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports.
Let me now turn to the role for monetary policy in supporting the recovery. When the MPC first provided
explicit guidance over the future course of policy last August, the economy had shown early signs of
recovery but we believed that there were still considerable underutilised resources in the economy that
needed to be absorbed, otherwise we were likely to find inflation falling below our 2% target in the medium
term. Our worry was that the mere sign of a return to decent growth rates could prompt premature
expectations of rises in Bank Rate, dampening the recovery. So we promised not even to think about raising
Bank Rate until the unemployment rate had fallen to at least 7%, subject to the risks to price and financial
stability being contained. Unemployment is not a comprehensive measure of economic slack. It ignores:
the underutilisation of capacity inside businesses; the scope for labour force participation to rise as the
labour market strengthens; and that some employees would prefer to work longer hours. But these different
components of slack do broadly tend to move together.
Now, as I indicated earlier, employment growth has been stronger and productivity growth weaker than
anticipated last summer. That means the unemployment rate – currently 7.2% – is likely to reach that 7%
threshold earlier than expected. So, although – and contrary to some newspaper reports – our August
guidance still remains in place, we thought it helpful in February to say more on what would happen after the
threshold was reached. In particular, recognising that the date at which Bank Rate would need to rise was
drawing nearer, we thought we ought to say more not only about that, but also what would happen
thereafter.
At the current juncture, the central view on the Committee is that total slack in the economy is equivalent to
around 1-1½% of GDP, though there is necessarily a lot of uncertainty around that estimate. The slack
appears to be concentrated largely in the labour market, as survey measures indicate that businesses are
operating at close to normal capacity (Chart 7). Broadly speaking, we will be aiming to absorb that slack
over the next two to three years, while keeping inflation close to the 2% target. Of course, output can rise by
more than 1-1½% before slack is eliminated because supply generally rises over time as well as demand.
The extent and pace of any rebound in productivity will consequently be crucial in deciding how quickly slack
gets absorbed.

In our latest projections (Charts 8 and 9), conditioned on prevailing market interest rates, the central path for
inflation remains close to the target throughout, while the margin of slack is diminished, though not quite
eliminated, by the time the forecast horizon is reached. That market curve implies a first rise in Bank Rate in
the spring of 2015, though I should stress that we are likely to learn a lot between now and then about the
pace of the recovery, the amount of slack and the evolution of supply, and the impact on costs and prices.
So I would counsel against getting too hung up about the precise date at which Bank Rate first rises.
What, I think, is more useful for businesses to hang on to is our expectation that when Bank Rate does rise,
it will probably do so only gradually and to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis
average of 5% for some while – I have something like a 2-3% range in mind here. That reflects three factors.
First, the process of private and public balance sheet repair will continue to weigh on domestic demand for
some time, while the recovery in the euro area – our main export market – is likely to remain muted.
Second, global longer-term safe real interest rates fell in the years before the crisis, reflecting in particular
the unusually high saving rates in China, and this is likely to persist. Third, the spreads between risky market
interest rates and Bank Rate are unlikely to return to their excessively compressed pre-crisis levels. So even
if we start to withdraw some of the exceptional monetary stimulus in the not too distant future, you should not
expect Bank Rate to shoot straight back up to pre-crisis levels.
It is now five years since we cut Bank Rate to its historic low of 0.5% and launched our asset purchase
programme (QE). Those five years have been tough for both businesses and households. But they surely
would have been even tougher had we not taken that action. Compared with the 1990s recession, and
despite a far greater collapse in demand, fewer businesses have failed and fewer people have lost their jobs
and their homes.
Now, at last, there are clear signs that the economy is on the mend. It is still early days and the MPC will be
doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud. But when the time does come for us to
start raising Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the
road back to normality. Thank you!
