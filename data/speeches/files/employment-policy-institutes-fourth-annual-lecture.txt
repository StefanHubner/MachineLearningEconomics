It is both an honour and a challenge to deliver the fourth EPI lecture. It is an honour to follow in such
distinguished footsteps, and it is a challenge to tackle the subject of the link between monetary policy and
the labour market. Few subjects are as emotive. Wages, jobs and unemployment feature as frequently in the
popular press as they do in academic articles. The Bank of England must learn from one in order to convey
our message in the other. And we are fortunate in that labour economics is a field in which British
economists have been - and continue to be - at the forefront of research. That I can say objectively because I
am not myself a labour economist. So tonight I shall be exploring lessons from the labour market for the
Monetary Policy Committee. The Employment Policy Institute has played an important role in bringing
together those undertaking research on labour markets and those involved with policy decisions. In
particular, its Employment Audit provides a valuable commentary on current developments.

The labour market is unlike any other market. Indeed, for many people the very language of economists equilibrium unemployment, market-clearing wages - seems incompatible with the human dimension of
unemployment and deprivation. Are the 16 million unemployed people in the European Union merely an
equilibrium, on the one hand, and a statistic, on the other? But for most people the labour market is the
market where - for better or worse, in sickness or in health - they sell their time and their skills at a market
price. That price determines, in large part, their opportunities and economic welfare. Wage rates have a
much greater significance in influencing the distribution of real incomes than do the prices of almost anything
else. As a result, the labour market cannot be divorced from broader social and political considerations.

If their terminology and language are sometimes insensitive, what do economists have to offer by way of
ideas about unemployment? The prize for the most important idea and most insensitive terminology surely
goes to Milton Friedman for the concept of the natural rate of unemployment. I shall discuss shortly the
significance of this idea for monetary policy. But for a more elegant advocacy of a similar position it is
necessary to delve further back in history.

This month sees the 75th anniversary of the publication of what Milton Friedman described as John Maynard
Keynes' best book: A Tract on Monetary Reform. It is, undoubtedly, one of the most persuasive polemics
ever written on the subject of monetary policy. To coincide with publication in December 1923, Keynes gave
a lecture to the National Liberal Club in which he talked about "the triple evils of modern society". From the
notes Keynes used for that lecture - printed in his Collected Writings - we can see that Keynes regarded the
evils as, first, the "vast enrichment of individuals out of proportion to any services rendered"; second, the
"disappointment of expectations and difficulty of laying plans ahead"; and, third, "unemployment";. Fat cats,
short-termism, and the jobless society: Keynes was ahead of his time. All these, Keynes argued, were
"mainly due to instability of the standard of value". Over the past twenty years, Britain faced the same three
problems. The income distribution widened and the rewards for those with special talents, and even for some
with no apparent talent, increased significantly more than earnings for the unskilled. Both inflation and
expectations of inflation were high and unstable, making it more difficult for firms to plan for the long-term.
And the unemployment rate rose to double-digit levels.

Keynes argued that the way to prevent those triple evils from undermining society was price stability. Central
bankers should be as vigilant in countering deflation as in preventing inflation. The link between
unemployment and inflation has been a central theme in macroeconomics for the remainder of the century.

Following the publication of A Tract on Monetary Reform, Keynes received a letter from none other than the
Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. "Dear Keynes," he wrote, "I write to you in this familiar fashion
because we are both old Kings' Scholars, though not of the same election." So far, so good. Regrettably,
however, the then Deputy Governor's only comment on the book appeared to be that he was grateful to
Keynes for writing in a style which an educated man could read with pleasure, and for having the book
printed in a particularly attractive style.

This Deputy Governor has learned a great deal from Keynes’ book. I refer to it in almost every lecture I give.
In this lecture I shall discuss three aspects of the significance of the labour market for monetary policy. The
first of these concerns the link between unemployment and inflation in the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy.

The second issue is how the Monetary Policy Committee uses the available empirical information about the
UK labour market when deciding on interest rates. How do unemployment figures and earnings data enter
the MPC’s decisions?

The third issue is the way in which unemployment enters the objectives of monetary policy. With an explicit
inflation target, is it true that the MPC neither cares about unemployment nor takes it into consideration when
setting interest rates?

The Labour market and the monetary transmission mechanism

The theory of unemployment has spawned more concepts, and – without doubt – more acronyms, than
almost any other field of economics (apart, perhaps, from measures of price inflation). I shall return to the
language of unemployment later. But I want first to discuss the two concepts which are at the heart of any
discussion of monetary policy and the labour market. They are the natural rate of unemployment and the rate
of unemployment consistent with stable inflation, usually known as the NAIRU.

The concept of the natural rate of unemployment introduced by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps thirty
years ago, is the level of unemployment that - as Friedman famously described - would be "ground out by
the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations" reflecting the structural characteristics of the labour
and product markets. Friedman was the first to recognise that this natural rate of unemployment was neither
constant over time nor immune to policy influences.

The natural rate hypothesis implies a vertical long-run Phillips curve. In other words, if the monetary
authorities attempted to "peg" the level of unemployment below the natural rate, then this in time would
cause the inflation rate to rise indefinitely. The work of Friedman and Phelps soon proved highly relevant.
The futility of using monetary policy to choose between different combinations of unemployment and inflation
became only too apparent in the 1970s. Monetary shocks can – and in the early 1980s and 1990s, did –
cause unemployment to deviate from its natural rate, but only for a period. As inflation expectations catch up
with the consequences of the monetary shock, unemployment returns to the natural rate.

But the responses of unemployment and inflation expectations to monetary shocks are far from immediate.
Indeed, Friedman speculated that the full adjustment to an unexpected change in inflation might take up to "a
couple of decades". Such long lags in the dynamics of the labour market mean that there is unlikely to be a
simple relationship between deviations of unemployment from its natural rate and changes in the inflation
rate. Chart 1 shows that it did indeed take almost twenty years to bring inflation and inflation expectations
(implied by financial market returns on indexed and conventional gilts) down from double digit levels to the
current target of 2½%, accompanied by a large rise and subsequent fall in unemployment.

The idea of the NAIRU can be thought of as a conceptual response to inertia in the system which means that
the response of the economy to shocks will be protracted. In 1975 Franco Modigliani and Lucas Papademos
introduced the concept of the non-inflation rate of unemployment – the NIRU – defined as "a rate such that,
as long as unemployment is above it, inflation can be expected to decline". Note in passing that more
appropriate terminology would be the non-increasing inflation rate of unemployment (NIIRU). Modigliani and
Papademos recognised that the NIRU would be affected by macroeconomic shocks. They argued that there
was evidence to suggest that "over the last two decades the NIRU [in the US] was held down by a
favourable trend in the terms of trade between the private nonfarm sectors on the one hand and imported
goods and farm products on the other. A termination or reversal of this trend would tend to raise the NIRU, at
least temporarily".

It is ironic that two of the most prominent economists of countries synonymous with art and beauty – Italy
and Greece – (one a future Nobel prize winner and the other a future central bank governor), should have
given birth to an unattractive acronym that has spawned so many even more unappealing cousins. The first,
and most feted, off-spring – the NAIRU – was introduced by James Tobin five years later. NIRU, NIIRU,
NAIRU – tongue twisters for the Financial Times Christmas quiz, or measures of the Inflationary Trigger
Point? Take your choice. For the sake of simplicity I shall adopt the conventional term, NAIRU, to represent
the entire family.

So what is the relationship between the natural rate of unemployment and the NAIRU? The natural rate of
unemployment and the NAIRU are quite different concepts. The former describes a real equilibrium
determined by the structural characteristics of the labour and product markets – the grinding out of
Friedman’s Walrasian general equilibrium system (modified, if necessary, by non-Walrasian features of

labour markets such as imperfect competition, search behaviour and efficiency wages). It exists
independently of the inflation rate. In contrast, the latter, as well as being affected by these structural
characteristics, is also affected by the gradual adjustment of the economy to past economic shocks that
determine the path of inflation. Because it is defined as the unemployment rate at which there is no
immediate pressure for a change in the inflation rate, it is a reduced form – not a structural – variable.

This difference is reflected in the methods used to generate empirical estimates of the two concepts. The
natural rate of unemployment can be estimated only by reference to a structural model of the labour market
which has explicit microeconomic underpinnings and which can be used to identify the characteristics
determining the natural rate. Empirical estimates of the natural rate would typically be related to inflation only
in the long-run when the effects of shocks average out. In contrast, the NAIRU is estimated using a system
of time-series equations relating inflation to past and present economic shocks. The sole criterion for judging
the success of estimates of the NAIRU is their short-term correlation with inflation. Indeed, the NAIRU as
defined here – and in recent work by Estrella and Mishkin (1998) – is the level of unemployment such that
the difference between it and the current rate of unemployment is all that is necessary to describe short–run
inflationary pressure.

Although the NAIRU will tend towards the natural rate of unemployment in the long-run, there is no reason to
expect there to be a close relationship between the two measures in the short-run. The natural rate is likely
to move only relatively slowly over time in response to changes in its structural determinants. In contrast, the
NAIRU will vary both with changes in the natural rate and in response to macroeconomic shocks. So those
who argue that estimates of the NAIRU are too time-varying to be plausible are, I think, in danger of missing
the point.

The NAIRU can be used as an ex-post device to describe the level of unemployment at which inflation did (or
would have) started to increase. But the usefulness of these estimates as an ex-ante predictor of future
inflationary pressure depends critically upon the economic environment. In particular, for estimates of the
NAIRU to be a good predictor of future inflation, the natural rate would need to be relatively stable, and the
magnitude of likely shocks would need to be small. This perhaps goes some way to explaining why
estimates of the NAIRU in the recent past have appeared to contain more ex-ante information about future
inflation in the US than they have in Europe.

More fundamentally, the distinction between the natural rate and the NAIRU illustrates the difficulty of using
those concepts for the month to month implementation of monetary policy. The natural rate, although clearly
relevant to the dynamics of inflation, is not sufficient to explain changes in the inflation rate. The NAIRU,
which is defined to be a measure related to short-run inflationary pressures, requires knowledge of the
reduced form of the transmission mechanism and the history of shocks to the economy. But that knowledge
is required also for a forecast for inflation, and so the NAIRU itself provides no additional information over

that contained in the forecast. Indeed, estimates of the NAIRU could be described as a by-product of the
process of forecasting inflation.

As an example, consider the impact of the appreciation of sterling from mid 1996 until late 1997. Retail price
inflation can be thought of as a weighted average of domestic and imported inflation. The substantial real
appreciation of sterling since mid 1996 has for a while reduced the imported component of UK inflation and
so, in turn, retail price inflation, below the level that it would otherwise have reached. In essence the NAIRU
fell relative to the natural rate. That restraining effect on inflation will gradually wear-off and begin to be
reversed if sterling continues to fall. The issue of whether the domestic inflation component would fall to a
level consistent with the inflation target by the time this temporarily depressing effect wore off was central to
the monetary policy debate during the summer.

The example of sterling’s appreciation shows how a macroeconomic shock, entirely independent of the
labour market, can affect the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation. The
rise in sterling is likely to have reduced the NAIRU via two separate channels. First, in the short-run, the
relationship between domestically generated inflation – of which wage inflation is a substantial element – and
retail price inflation shifts because of lower imported inflation. Second, the temporary improvement in the
terms of trade that followed the rise in sterling in 1996 reduced the wedge between the real consumption
wage –which is of relevance to employees and which reflects a mix of both domestic and imported inflation
components – and the real product wage – which is of relevance to employers and which reflects the prices
only of domestically produced goods. That reduction in the wedge is likely to have reduced the pressure on
nominal wage growth for any given level of unemployment.

So it is quite possible to believe that the NAIRU has fallen even if the natural rate has not. But this is likely to
be temporary. As the impact of sterling’s appreciation on wages and prices wears off the NAIRU will, other
things being equal, rise towards the natural rate. But other more lasting changes may reduce the natural rate
(and hence the NAIRU). For example, a range of government policies including changes to the Jobseekers
Allowance, the New Deal and the new Working Families Tax Credit, have increased incentives to work. The
National Minimum Wage works in the opposite direction. Assessing the impact of these structural factors on
the natural rate is no easier than calculating the effect of macroeconomic shocks on the NAIRU. But it is
useful to distinguish the two concepts, not least because they can move quite differently in the short-run.

Enough of this theory, some of which may appear largely semantic. None of it is, of course, either new or
original. But understanding the language of unemployment matters. Richard Rogerson, in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives last year, posed the question "Have the language and concepts developed by
economists in their study of unemployment served their role of fostering clear communication of findings and
allowing issues to be sharply defined?" Professor Rogerson’s conclusion, you will perhaps not be surprised
to hear, was a resounding no. Neither the natural rate nor the NAIRU are terms well chosen to win friends
and influence people. After all, there is nothing natural about the natural rate.

Whatever we call them, it is crucial to recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about the location of
both the natural rate of unemployment and the NAIRU. Even in the United States, where there appears to be
no obvious trend in the natural rate, estimates of the 95% confidence interval for the NAIRU are typically
from 5% to 7.5%. In the UK where both structural reforms and macroeconomic shocks have had a larger
impact than in the US, the range of uncertainty is even greater. Perhaps the most honest answer to the
question of what is the natural rate was that given by Milton Friedman to the Wall Street Journal in January
1995, "I don’t know what the natural rate is, neither do you, and neither does anyone else."

The labour market and monetary policy in practice?

How do these concepts affect monetary policy in practice? And what role does analysis of the labour market
play in the Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions on interest rates?

Using the language of unemployment developed earlier, the MPC has to assess whether the current level of
unemployment differs significantly from the NAIRU, and, as importantly, whether it is likely to remain so in
the future. It may do that explicitly by taking a view on the level of the NAIRU, or it may do it implicitly by
producing a forecast for inflation. In practice, we focus directly on an inflation forecast.

But the need for policymakers to focus on the level of unemployment and the level of output each time they
assess the stance of monetary policy is unavoidable. Alan Greenspan has to do it. MPC members have to do
it. Knowing that the growth rate of GDP is (or is likely to be) above or below its trend rate of increase is of
little value unless one also knows where the level of output is relative to potential. This is a basic, but
fundamental, point. If, for whatever reason, the level of unemployment is below the natural rate, a rise in
unemployment is unavoidable. That may be undesirable. But any attempt to avoid it will simply result in a
longer, or more pronounced, correction at a future date. In order to hit the inflation target the MPC needs to
minimise deviations in the level of output from potential, not in the growth rate of output from its trend.

The need to focus attention on the level of economic activity is of course well understood by the academic
community. It is now standard practice in the literature on monetary policy to assume that the authorities
seek to minimise a social loss function, defined in terms of the deviation of the level of output or
unemployment from their equilibrium values, and in terms of the deviation of inflation from its desired value.
But if this is so obvious, why, in discussions of the economic conjuncture and economic policy is so much
attention placed on growth rates rather than on levels? Why are commentators and pundits so concerned
with whether economic growth is going to be above or below its trend rate, or even whether it is likely to be
above or below zero? That is not what matters for economic policy nor, more importantly, for social welfare.

An excessive focus on growth rates of output and employment, rather than on their levels, may reflect a
rather natural, but dangerous, optimism about the degree of spare capacity in the economy. After all, is not
the belief that we could always achieve lower unemployment without an increase in inflation the mark of a

kinder, gentler, altogether more civilised approach to economic policy? Or is it simply wishful thinking? As
Greg Mankiw put it:

"Wishful thinking is one reason that monetary policy has historically been excessively inflationary…To my
mind, wishful thinking is as worrisome a problem for monetary policy as time inconsistency."

Genuine concern for the unemployed means a recognition that sustainable reductions in unemployment
require a combination of monetary stability on the demand side and microeconomic reforms such as the New
Deal on the supply side. As Alan Blinder has reminded us, we need soft hearts and hard heads, not the other
way round.

Despite suggestions to the contrary, the MPC does have soft hearts and hard heads, and does not base its
assessment of the labour market – never mind its decisions on interest rates - solely on estimates of the
growth of average earnings. An assessment of the overall tightness of the labour market requires all the
available data – both quantity and prices – to be analysed. The wealth and diversity of published labour
statistics means it is rare for them all to point in the same direction. The MPC’s analysis of the labour market
is like the construction of a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of data are assessed alongside each other in order to
build up as clear a picture as possible. No single piece of data is interpreted in isolation. And no single piece
of data is, in itself, decisive.

The growth of wages and salaries is an important indicator of domestically generated inflation. But this does
not imply that there is some magical threshold defining ‘acceptable’ and ‘unacceptable’ rates of earnings
growth. In the short-run, the link between earnings growth and inflation is complicated by a whole host of
factors, including, exchange rate movements, cyclical variations in productivity and profit margins, irregular
bonus payments, and one-off adjustments to tax rates and other ‘wedge’ effects. It is true that given the UK’s
historical levels of annual productivity growth of around 2% and the inflation target of 2½%, it would be a
cause for concern to the MPC if average earnings increased by much more – or much less - than 4.5% a
year over a prolonged period without there being a corresponding change in trend productivity growth. That
is not because the Committee has a view about the appropriate level of pay awards. It is not our job to
second guess what businesses should or should not pay their employees. Nor is it because we think
earnings growth causes inflation - inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Rather it is because sustained
earnings growth much above or below these rates may indicate that the level of utilisation in the labour
market has reached a level inconsistent with the inflation target.

The June meeting of the MPC drew particular attention to the rise in headline earnings growth as measured
by the Average Earnings Index. But that should be viewed against a background of increasing concern about
the tightness of the labour market. In its meeting in April, the Monetary Policy Committee noted that "labour
market data on quantities were signalling a tighter position than the price [earnings] data". At that time, the
Labour Force Survey and claimant count measures of unemployment had both fallen below their previous

troughs recorded in the Spring of 1990, and were still declining. This position was evident across all
categories of unemployment, as can be seen from chart 2 which shows the various measures of joblessness
reported in the EPI’s Employment Audit. In addition, employment and total hours worked were rising quite
strongly; recruitment intentions were at their highest level for nine years, with the level of vacancies at
jobcentres, and the average duration of these vacancies, both well above their 1988/89 peaks; and survey
measures of recruitment difficulties were also at high levels.

The underlying rise of the Average Earnings Index had increased to 4½% by the beginning of 1997, but was
little changed by the end of the year. If I had been asked to deliver the third Annual EPI lecture, rather than
the fourth, the main question you might have expected me to grapple with was why earnings growth had not
at that point risen by more, given the 1.0 million fall in unemployment and the 1.4 million rise in LFS
employment since the end of 1992. As a Committee, we discussed at some length during the Spring of this
year why the changes in the quantity measures had not fed through to higher earnings growth. We
discussed whether the natural rate of unemployment (and NAIRU) might have declined due to an increase in
trend productivity or improvement in the functioning of the labour market. We also considered whether there
had been independent influences on the NAIRU stemming from falls in inflation expectations or the effects of
sterling’s appreciation.

It is against this background that the MPC’s decision to raise rates in June should be seen. The increase in
headline earnings growth to 4.9% in February, from an upwardly revised 4.6% the previous month, appeared
consistent with other labour market indicators. But we were fully aware of the evidence suggesting that the
rise in earnings growth had been, and for a couple of months would continue to be, affected by unusually
large bonus payments. If this was true, earnings growth might well have fallen back once the bonus effect
dropped out. Given the uncertainties in this area, the Committee concluded that it should not place too much
weight on the latest numbers. Instead, it stepped back and examined the underlying trend in the labour
market over the previous two years. We noted that private sector earnings growth had been rising throughout
this period and that reported wage settlements displayed a similar profile. Given this longer-term perspective,
the Monetary Policy Committee concluded that capacity constraints in the labour market were threatening
the attainment of the Government’s inflation target.

Of course, since then, the earnings data have been successively revised, rebased and suspended – a piece
of the jigsaw has temporarily gone missing. As you can see from chart 3, the profile of the old series showed
a steady rise in earnings growth from around 3¼% in mid-1995 to nearly 5½% or so by the Spring of this
year. In sharp contrast, the revised and rebased data (before they were suspended) followed roughly the
shape of a slightly squashed capital "N". From a trough of 3% at the end of 1995, earnings growth was
estimated to have risen to a peak of over 5¼% in February and March 1997 before falling back below 4% in
early 1998 and then bouncing back above 5% again by May.

How would the MPC’s analysis of the labour market have changed if the revised (but now suspended) data
had been available six months earlier? That question is not easy to answer. The quantity data would still
have suggested that the labour market was both tightening and, by historical standards, tight. The MPC
would therefore have had the unenviable task of trying to understand why the steady tightening in the
quantity measures had produced a zigzag path for measured earnings growth. We would also have had to
try to understand why the zigzag profile of the new Average Earnings Index was not visible in other
measures – shown in chart 4 - of nominal earnings growth, such as wage settlements and private surveys.
As I have said elsewhere, trying to reconcile the new earnings series with other labour market data is far
from easy.

The Chancellor wrote to Giles Radice, the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, on 23 October
announcing that he had asked Sir Andrew Turnbull and myself to conduct a review of the revisions to the
average earnings figures. The review, which is considering both methodological and managerial issues, is
being carried out by Martin Weale of the National Institute, supported by Peter Sedgwick of the Treasury.
Martin and Peter have made an enormous effort over the last month or so to finish the review as quickly as
possible. However, exactly when the Report will be finished and what it will conclude, are, I am afraid, still
not known. As a result, the ONS has yet to decide when to resume publication of the average earnings
series. All I can say today is watch this space.

The labour market and the objectives of monetary policy

In the final part of my talk, I want to turn to the question of what this analysis of the labour market implies for
monetary policy. One of – perhaps the – most important economic and social problems facing Europe is the
high level of unemployment – 16 million unemployed people throughout the European Union, a rate of over
10%, with young people under 25 accounting for almost a quarter of this total. That represents a major failure
of economic policy. But is it a failure of monetary policy? To go one step further, should the objectives of
monetary policy – whether enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty or in the Chancellor’s remit for the Monetary
Policy Committee – be altered to include an explicit reference to unemployment? Many think so. For
example, the new German Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, has said that, his aim was a "European
monetary policy that supported growth and employment as well as price stability". Nearer to home, the TUC
has called for the MPC to be given a wider remit to include employment as well as inflation. And several
newspaper editorials have argued for a broader remit for the MPC.

The fact that the proposition appeared in a newspaper does not of course mean that it is necessarily
compelling. As my newsagent told me the other day: "don’t believe everything you read in the newspapers –
they are all in the hands of the media".

The argument for including employment explicitly in the formal remit of the Monetary Policy Committee is
often bolstered by reference to the objectives of the Federal Reserve in the United States, which is charged
10

by statute with promoting "the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term
interest rates". At first sight, this appears to contrast with the remit of the MPC which is to: "(a) maintain price
stability and (b) subject to that to support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its
objectives for growth and employment". But what matters most is the intellectual framework underlying the
behaviour of the central bank. The Federal Reserve’s remit does not make clear if the FOMC is supposed to
try to exploit some long-term trade-off between employment and inflation. But the practice is clear. Under
Alan Greenspan’s leadership, the FOMC has firmly rejected the notion that by accepting a somewhat higher
rate of inflation it is possible to achieve a permanently higher level of employment.

It is conventional to express the implications of a vertical long-term Phillips curve in terms of the statement
that unemployment can be held below the natural rate only by accepting accelerating inflation – or, to be
more precise, an inflation rate higher than anticipated by wage bargainers. Equally, however, the statement
can be turned the other way round. If the central bank is successful in pursuing, over a number of years, a
constant rate of inflation then unemployment cannot remain above the natural rate indefinitely. Not only can
central banks not bring unemployment down below the natural rate for long, neither can they be accused of
keeping unemployment persistently above the natural rate. Monetary policy cannot influence levels of
employment in the long-run. There should be no surprise about this. A central bank can use its chosen
instrument – interest rates – to hit a nominal target – such as an inflation target, or a target for the exchange
rate or even the growth of nominal GDP – but it cannot use a nominal instrument to target some desired level
of a real variable, such as the growth rate of output or the level of unemployment.

None of the above means that monetary policy has no impact on unemployment. To the contrary, monetary
policy does affect the movements of employment and unemployment over the business cycle. And the remit
of the MPC makes clear how we should take this consideration into account – as I explained a year ago in a
lecture at the LSE. By aiming consistently and symmetrically to hit the inflation target, the MPC should
ensure that inflation is, on average over a number of years, close to the target of 2½%. Shocks of various
kinds will mean that inflation will often deviate from the target and the MPC is required to take action to bring
inflation back to the target. But it will do so gradually, if to do otherwise would have damaging consequences
for employment or output. By looking ahead and aiming to bring inflation back on track over a horizon of two
years or so, the MPC should be able to avoid undesirable volatility of employment and output. That is part of
our remit.

Conclusions

Let me briefly draw two conclusions from my analysis tonight. First, the concept of a natural rate of
unemployment, and the existence of a vertical long-run Phillips curve, are crucial to the framework of
monetary policy. They help us to focus on levels of output and employment rather than simply their growth
rates. They also mean that there may be times when, although a rise in unemployment is undesirable, it is
unavoidable. But the natural rate is of much less help in operational decisions on interest rates made month

by month. This is because the natural rate is determined by microeconomic structural factors that are not
easy to observe, and which are likely to change over time, and may not bear any close relationship to
inflationary pressures in the short-run.

More easily observable in terms of its relationship to inflation and unemployment is the concept of the
NAIRU. This differs from the natural rate when macroeconomic shocks affect the rate of inflation
corresponding to any degree of excess demand in the labour market. Since the NAIRU represents the
current reduced-form relationship between inflation and unemployment, it is possible to calculate the
prospects for inflation without any need to refer to such a variable as the NAIRU. It is a convenient shorthand
concept for purposes of exposition, but not a necessary tool for operational decisions on interest rates.

Second, the contribution of monetary policy to employment objectives is to promote economic stability in its
broadest sense. I referred at the outset to Keynes’ view that the "triple evils" of an unequal distribution of
income, instability of expectations, and unemployment, were all related to an unstable and unpredictable
monetary standard. The solution, Keynes suggested, was to set monetary policy to hit a target for prices, or
a low and stable inflation rate. He argued 75 years ago that monetary policy should be devoted to regulating
the supply of money so that "the index number of prices will never move far from a fixed point". Keynes went
on to say that,

"The Bank of England since the war has always done exactly the opposite of what the latest science
recommends. I conclude from this that their opposition comes, not from mere obstinacy or conservatism, but
from their not yet understanding the point. I am, therefore, optimistic about the future."

It took the Bank of England almost seventy years to get to that point and introduce an inflation target. The
objective of stability is best achieved by an inflation target because it stresses both what monetary policy
cannot do – reduce unemployment in the long-run – and what it can do – react to shocks in order to minimise
undesirable volatility in output and employment. To that end, the pursuit of an explicit and symmetric inflation
target is the relevant objective of monetary policy. With an inflation target, and, more recently, the new
