Triumph (and Tragedy) of Monetary Policy
Time inconsistency: resolved by society choosing preferred rate of
inflation, then delegating operational responsibility to the monetary
authority.
MPC’s monetary policy remit: achieve price stability, defined by the
Government as 12-month CPI inflation of 2%. Target is symmetric and
applies at all times.
Temporary deviations from target: recognised explicitly in remit since
2013; Bringing inflation back too rapidly could cause undesirable volatility
in output and employment.

Grand Unifying Theory of Macroprudential Policy
Primary
objective

To identify, monitor and take action to remove or reduce systemic risks with a
view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK’s financial system

Secondary
objective

And…

Support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government,
including its objectives for growth and employment.

Not required or authorised to exercise functions in a way that would in its opinion be
likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to
contribute to the growth of the UK economy in the medium or long term.

Monetary Policy vs Macroprudential Policy
Clarity of objectives: MPC’s primary objective readily measured; FPC’s
primary objective only estimated

Impact on growth: MPC limited ability to influence trend growth. FPC
policies potentially important for trend growth given permanent scarring
from crises and influence on productive finance

Time horizon: Longer horizon means discount rate more important for
FPC

Bank capital requirements balance reducing GDP-at-risk vs dampening
investment and productivity. CCyB cushions shocks in a downturn, and
matches resilience to risk environment.

FPC’s principles deliver consistency between liquidity and

Funds should apply a pricing tool, a notice period or a combination of both that reflects the liquidity of their
