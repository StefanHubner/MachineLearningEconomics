Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for your kind invitation to be here with
you tonight. Despite its name, the Bank of England is the central bank of the United
Kingdom, and as such it is essential for us to get out and about in the country at large,
explaining our actions, and listening hard to the views of businesses and the wider public
about the way we are doing our job. In the past year, members of the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee have made some 50 visits across the UK. On this trip, apart from attending this
dinner, I have held a meeting with the regional council of the CBI, discussed trading
conditions with local business people, and explained our mission to some of the Northern
Irish press.
I want to cover three main themes in my comments tonight. First, I want briefly to explain
the Bank’s general approach to monetary policy. Second, I want to give you my current
assessment of the outlook for the economy. And, third, I want to explain the Bank’s other key
role – that of maintaining stability in our financial system.
The accountancy profession is very much under the microscope at the moment, as part of the
rash of Enronitis which fills the pages of the press. I want to touch on Enron at the end of my
talk here tonight, since it raises a number of issues of relevance to us at the Bank in our
broader financial stability role.
Maintaining monetary stability
I turn first though to the Bank’s role of maintaining monetary stability. The current
institutional arrangements were put in place in May 1997, when the Chancellor established
the Monetary Policy Committee. The MPC’s target is extremely clear, and – I hope – well
known. We aim for 2½% inflation in retail prices (excluding mortgage payments) at all
times. That target is set by the Government. And it is symmetric: that is to say, we worry as
much about being below the target as we do about being above it. That makes sense because
the problems of severe deflation are just as great as the problems of severe inflation.

3

Since the inception of the MPC, RPIX inflation has been extremely stable by historical
standards, and close to target. Some commentators have suggested we have had more than
our fair share of luck in achieving this outcome. There may well be some truth in that. But
I’m not sure that we should be too surprised. Market and survey evidence shows that people
are now clear that the MPC will do what it takes to keep inflation on track. And that
expectation is factored into their own behaviour, whether it is negotiating wages, setting
prices, or deciding how much to borrow and consume. All of that goes a long way towards
ensuring that inflation is well anchored to the target.
Of course, from month to month, inflation will still vary somewhat around 2½%. In recent
months, RPIX has been a little below target, and there has even been some interest in whether
it might reach 1.5%, the point at which the Governor would have to write a formal letter to the
Chancellor explaining what was going on. The pick up of inflation to 2.6% in January has
silenced this discussion, at least for the time being. We pore over the reasons for such
developments in enormous detail at the Bank. But in the bigger scheme of things these
month-to-month movements are quite small, and are I hope likely to play very little – if any –
role in the key decisions of your businesses, or those you represent.
People often ask if our relative success at targeting inflation has come at a cost in terms of lost
output or employment. It is increasingly accepted, I think, that there is no such trade-off in
the long run. And, looking at recent data, it is hard to see a trade-off even in the short run.
Unemployment remains close to its lowest level for a quarter of a century – a trend seen in
Northern Ireland just as much as in the UK as a whole. And UK GDP has now risen for 38
consecutive quarters (albeit in the case of 2001 Q4, only just!), the longest continuous
expansion since post-war records began. Achieving low and stable inflation is the best
contribution that monetary policy can make to the wider economic goals of sustainable
growth and employment. Having an inflation target certainly does not mean that we ignore
real activity. We have discretion over how rapidly we try to bring inflation back to target
when and if it diverges from 2½%. And we regularly publish our best estimate about the
likely future path of growth up to a two year horizon. But the aim of policy is clear – we do
what is necessary to keep inflation on target.

4

As you know, there are nine of us on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, and we meet
once a month to make our interest rate decision. This is a rigorous process, and rightly so.
But, of course, agreement on process need not, and does not, imply universal agreement on
the appropriate stance of policy, as our minutes show. Indeed, an industry has grown up
geared to guessing MPC members’ personal habits, psychoanalysing our personalities and
classifying us into different species of the aviary. But it is important to recognise, I think, that
disagreements are evidence of the strength of the system, not its weakness. Economic
analysis involves a great deal of peering into the future, so it is not surprising that there should
be differences of view. And the opportunity to explore and explain these differences in a
rational and open way is an important part of getting to a better answer.
The outlook for the economy
I now want to turn briefly to the current policy debate.
The key focus of the MPC’s recent discussions has been the implications of the slowdown in
world growth, which became apparent in the US during the first half of last year, but was
exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September. World trade rose by only around 1½% in
2001, less than a quarter of the average growth in the previous three years. That of course has
had very serious implications for businesses exposed to international trade, of which I know
there are many in Northern Ireland.
Monetary policy has not been idle in the face of this challenge. Interest rates have been cut by
4¾% in the US since the start of last year, by 2% in the UK and by 1½% in the euro area.
How far monetary policy by itself would be able to insulate the world economy if the
slowdown were to persist is I think hard to say at this stage. Very significant uncertainties
remain. But recent news from the US has been encouraging. GDP growth in the fourth
quarter of last year has been revised upwards, consumer confidence has rebounded somewhat
and the main forward looking surveys of activity in the manufacturing and services sector
have been looking substantially more positive since the turn of the year. Consistent with this
tentative recovery in optimism, the Consensus survey of professional economists’ forecasts
for near-term growth in the US has been revised upwards for the first time in quite a period.

5

So far, the UK has escaped the worst of the squalls raging across the Atlantic. Though GDP
growth slowed over the course of last year, output in 2001 was still 2.4% higher than a year
earlier, close to trend growth. Underlying this relatively benign aggregate picture, there are of
course some quite marked differences: on the expenditure side, between growth in
consumption, which has surged ahead, and growth in investment, which has been strikingly
depressed; and, on the output side, between the fortunes of firms in manufacturing, which
have borne the brunt of the global slowdown, and those of firms in the more sheltered
services sector.
These differences are sometimes referred to as ‘imbalances’, and it is certainly true that we
can neither expect (nor wish) for them to persist over the long run. The shake-out in
manufacturing has been particularly severe, as you know here only too well. Manufacturing
output in Northern Ireland fell by some 4.6% in the year to last autumn, compared with a fall
of 3.5% in the UK as a whole. But not all of the sectoral differences that have emerged are
necessarily unwelcome. Indeed, for those seeking to ensure stability in the economy as a
whole, it is really just as well that consumption growth has remained robust at a time when
the net trade position of the economy has worsened so markedly. And, as recent MPC
minutes show, that has been our intention. So long as the world economy recovers quickly
enough to pick up the slack as consumption slows, it may be that we in the UK will avoid the
sharp recessions of previous cycles.
Of course, this is a big ‘if’, and I do not want to imply that I am excessively confident that this
will occur. Rapid consumption growth brings with it considerable risks, not least when it is
financed by a large build up in consumer debt. But it is the MPC’s central expectation that
we will escape a serious slowdown at current interest rates. In the last few weeks, we have
seen some tentative signs of an unwinding of some of the more severe sectoral gaps in the
economy, with the slowdown in retail sales growth since the start of the year, and an
encouraging pickup in a number of surveys of business confidence and investment intentions.
Overall, it seems to me that the risks around the outlook for UK inflation are fairly evenly
balanced. On the downside, the speed of the recovery in the world economy may be held
back by a number of factors, including the large outstanding debt position of corporate and
household sectors; investment in the UK might remain subdued; or the weakness in pricing

6

pressures we have seen over the past year or so may persist. But on the upside, the US might
bounce back more rapidly than anticipated; consumption growth might remain robust; or the
sterling exchange rate might begin to adjust downwards.
Against this background of risks, it is quite possible we may see rates at current levels for
some time until the way ahead is clearer. But, as you know, economic events have a habit of
developing quite rapidly, so even short term predictions are never easy. For our part, we will
continue to assess the case for interest rate changes on a month-by-month basis.
In carrying out our task, the MPC relies heavily on having the very best information at our
disposal, and in that we are enormously assisted by our network of regional Agencies. Each
month, our Agents drive thousands of miles, eat hundreds of rushed sandwich lunches and, on
occasion, no doubt push your goodwill to the limit as they seek out the latest news on
developments in your businesses. Nigel Falls, our local Agent, is here with me tonight, and
for those of you who have not already met him I really do encourage you to do so after the
dinner. Agents attend the monthly briefing in Threadneedle Street ahead of each policy
meeting, so information from their contacts is fed directly into the heart of the policy process.
I know I speak for all of my colleagues on the MPC when I say that we really do find this a
crucial barometer of current events, so I hope you will feel that a short while with our Agents
once or twice a year is time well spent!
Financial stability and Enron
I now turn to my final subject tonight – that of the Bank’s role in ensuring financial stability.
Responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of banks passed from the Bank of England to
the Financial Services Authority in 1997. But as the central bank we still have a key role in
overseeing the stability of the system as a whole. In this guise we meet on a monthly basis
with HM Treasury and the FSA in the so-called tripartite Standing Committee, to review the
risks facing the UK financial system and take stock of any actions which may be required to
address them. Keeping close to the FSA is particularly important. To this end, I sit on the
FSA Board, and Howard Davies is a member of the Bank’s Court.

7

Of course, as I have no need to remind you here, with the border of the euro area just a few
miles down the road, we cannot look at the UK system in isolation from the wider
international financial markets. The world economic slowdown, with the attendant rise in
credit risks, the deepening problems in Argentina spreading to its banking system, and the
events of 11 September, creating temporary liquidity strains in New York and elsewhere,
have all posed serious risks to the stability of the international financial system. So far, the
response has been encouraging. The capital position of many of the larger financial players is
stronger than in previous cycles. There seems to be a more sophisticated approach to
differentiating between sovereign risks in the emerging markets. And the hugely impressive
efforts of staff, together with the largely successful operation of contingency plans, and the
flexibility of the US monetary authorities, saw us through the worst of the aftermath to last
autumn’s attacks without a serious crisis emerging.
The latest topic of discussion in financial circles is, of course, the implications of the collapse
of Enron. The case raises a host of issues for firms and policy makers. Some of these relate
to accounting standards; some relate to the way in which the auditing profession organises
itself; and some relate to corporate governance issues more generally. There are also some
issues about the scope and operation of the financial regulation net.
There have also been questions raised about the implications of the collapse for health of the
financial system as a whole, which is very much of interest to the Bank, given our
responsibility for systemic risk. From the current perspective, these implications appear
limited, however. Enron had extensive links with banks and other financial firms, mediated
in part through the use of relatively new credit risk transfer instruments. Tracing these
exposures through to their ultimate owners is not a particularly straightforward business – an
issue that we at the Bank have been raising in a macro-prudential context for some time now,
most recently in our December Financial Stability Review. But on current information, the
residual exposures do not appear unmanageable. Indeed, the apparent dispersion of exposures
may even turn out to demonstrate the effectiveness of these markets in spreading risk.
The Bank does not have any direct locus on the accounting and corporate governance issues
raised by the case. But the way in which firms’ financial performance is overseen and
presented does have an important bearing on the disciplines applied by financial markets,

8

which are an essential component of maintaining financial stability in the wider sense. Public
confidence in financial statements and the role of auditors is critical. One set of issues relates
to the appropriateness of accounting rules governing the treatment of special purpose vehicles
and those relating to revenue recognition. This is a technical area, and one in which the rules
applied in the US and the UK are relevantly different. No doubt the appropriate professional
bodies will be looking at these questions.
Another set of issues relates to rules and practice governing the appointment of auditors, and
the extent and nature of non-audit work carried out by firms’ auditors. Best practice in listed
companies has for some time recognised the importance of rotating individual auditors. But
the relationship between a major listed company and its auditor goes well beyond the role of
the senior day-to-day audit partner. Before coming to the Bank of England, I had been
involved with companies where the audit partner had rotated; but the senior partner of the
firm, who took a close interest in the relationship, of course had not. If the profession
believes that rotation is important to maintain independence, should that rotation not relate to
the firm, with whom the relationship is, rather than any individual? There are of course good
arguments on the other side, and it will be interesting to see where the review of these and
related matters, recently announced by Patricia Hewitt, comes out.
Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a pleasure for me to come to Northern Ireland, to meet with
a number of business people during the course of this visit, and to join you this evening. Can
I take this opportunity to wish you, and the business communities you serve, all success for
the future.
