“An unconventional journey:
The Bank of England’s Asset Purchase Programme”

and
Member of the Monetary Policy Committee
BANK OF ENGLAND

Based on a presentation to contacts of the Bank’s Agency for the South-West
Stonehouse Court, Gloucestershire,
on 11 October 2010

In March 2009 the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (the MPC) embarked on
an ‘unconventional’ journey. Having cut Bank Rate to an historic all-time low of just half
of one per cent, the MPC initiated a programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance
of central bank reserves – commonly known as “Quantitative Easing” or QE.1 To date the
Bank, in line with MPC decisions, has bought £200bn of assets, equivalent to some 14% of
UK annual nominal GDP.

In this talk, I would like to briefly recap on why we started the QE programme and how
well it has worked. I then want to explain some of the details behind why it was done the
way it was and some technical details on what we plan going forward. Let me be clear
upfront that the purpose of this is to share some of our broader thinking about the asset
purchase programme, not to drop any hints about the future direction of monetary policy.

Why we did it and how well it worked
The global financial shock associated with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG in
September 2008 triggered a sharp and synchronised downturn in the world economy. In
the UK, GDP fell nearly 4% in 2009 H1 alone, and by the end of that year was some 10%
below where it would have been, if growth had continued at its previous trend. This was
one of the largest falls in output ever recorded in the UK.

At its March 2009 meeting the MPC cut Bank Rate to just 0.5%, the lowest level in the
Bank of England’s 300 year history. While that represented a significant loosening of
monetary policy, the MPC agreed that more stimulus was required to mitigate the risk of
depression and deflation.

Given that Bank Rate was close to its lower-bound, the MPC decided to increase the supply
of money in the economy directly, by embarking on a programme of asset purchases,
financed by the creation of central bank reserves (QE). This largely took the form of
purchases of UK government bonds - ‘gilts’ - but included small purchases of corporate
bonds and commercial paper undertaken in order to improve conditions in those markets. I
won’t say any more about the latter today.2 While the form of this policy was

In the central bank community, asset purchases are known as an example of an ‘unconventional’ monetary
policy.

“unconventional”, the ultimate goal was identical to any normal reduction in Bank Rate –
namely to stimulate nominal demand in the economy, and hence help the MPC achieve its
remit of targeting 2% CPI inflation. The UK was not alone in adopting unconventional
measures. Both the Federal Reserve Board in the United States, and the European Central
Bank undertook a range of alternative measures too. Although the precise nature of the
programmes differed from country to country, all three central banks saw their balance
sheets expand, funded by an increase in commercial bank reserves.3

At the time we started the asset purchases, it was far from clear how successful the policy
would be. None of those involved had ever personally experienced a financial crisis as big
as this, nor a recession so deep. And no one had direct experience of conducting a major
asset purchase programme in the UK. In the press and amongst other economic
commentators there was a lot of scepticism expressed about the likely efficacy of the
policy.

It is of course, extremely difficult to know what would have happened in the absence of the
asset purchase programme; not least because Bank Rate was at a record low and because
other, major central banks also loosened policy sharply. There might never be agreement
on a precise quantification of its effects but my own view is that the asset purchase
programme was extremely successful in meeting its immediate objectives.4 In particular I
would pick out the following points which were all consistent with the various channels
through which QE can work:


Broad money growth, although anaemic, did not fall by as much as should have been
expected given previous contractions in nominal GDP growth (Chart 1);



Analysis by some of my colleagues5 suggests that asset purchases may have lowered
long term interest rates on gilts at 5-25 years maturity by around 100 basis points
relative to what would otherwise have been the case;



Demand for risky assets increased: spreads on corporate bonds fell markedly, and
issuance of both corporate bonds and equities picked up to record rates in 2009
(Chart 2 and Table 1);



Inter-bank borrowing rates fell back sharply, most likely because significant
increases in commercial bank reserves reduced the need for banks to borrow from
each other in the inter-bank market. For example, three-month sterling LIBOR6 rates
fell from over 2% in late 2008 to under 1% during the course of 2009 (Chart 3). That
was potentially a very important supportive step as a good proportion of businesses in
the UK had floating rate loans which were linked to the LIBOR rate.

GDP stabilised by the end of 2009, and grew at close to trend rates in the first half of 2010.
The prospect of deflation, which had been a hot topic during early 2009, now seems much
less likely. Indeed, press commentary through 2010 has instead mostly been focused on the
elevated rate of CPI inflation (which reflects the temporary impact of a series of short-term
price level shocks).7

Why we did it the way we did
Although QE was an “unconventional” monetary policy operation, it was not totally
without international precedent, having been tried most notably in recent times by Japan.
The Japanese programme is generally considered to have been a mixed success at best.
Such a judgement is perhaps unfair but there were a number of lessons to be learned from
their experience and those acted as a backdrop to our own operations. In the remainder of
this speech, I want to discuss how we structured the UK’s asset purchases.

One aspect of our policy design for QE was to act decisively to prevent the risk of
deflation. In Japan, although their programme of outright purchases of government bonds
(JGBs) amounted to some 13% of nominal GDP, those purchases were conducted over a
period of 5 years (2001-2006). And they only began after deflation had already been
observed. It is possible that this dampened the impact8 and other policies were being
pursued at the same time. In the UK we conducted the purchases in similarly large size

(14% of GDP) but relatively quickly (over 10 months), to ward off the threat of deflation
rather than as a response to it.

A second aspect of the design was to target our purchases at assets held by the non-bank
sector. The proposition is that, by buying gilts from pension and insurance funds (for
example), those asset managers would have more cash in their portfolios than they desired,
and would be incentivised to use that cash to invest in other, more risky instruments such as
corporate bonds and equities. That ‘portfolio rebalancing’ channel is thought to have been
largely absent in Japan, where most of the Japanese government bonds purchased were held
by the banks, which in turn used the proceeds to directly de-leverage without obviously
increasing the demand for other assets (although the purchases may have had an impact
through other channels).

Buying assets held by non-banks was relatively straightforward in the UK. At the time,
insurance companies and pension funds were the largest category of holders of gilts in
issue. Although commercial banks act as market-makers for gilts, and were thus the
immediate conduit for the gilt purchases, they typically held only a very small amount on
their own balance sheets as part of their liquidity portfolios. Market-makers had to source
gilts in the market before selling on to the Bank. Moreover, because the banks’ own
liquidity holdings were generally very short-dated, we were able to target our purchases by
restricting them to be longer-dated: initially we only bought gilts over 5 years maturity.9

We were also conscious of the pressures on pension funds and their need to match longdated liabilities by buying index-linked and longer-dated nominal gilts. Real yields and
ultra-long nominal yields were already being driven to low levels by that demand. Hence,
we restricted the Bank’s purchases to nominal gilts only and initially capped the maturity at
25 years. The latter restriction was later relaxed as the purchase programme expanded.

In order to deliver the high-level policy objective of the MPC to inject extra money into the
economy, there were a number of operational objectives for Bank staff. First we wanted to
make sure that we were actually able to buy the targeted quantity. There were market
participants who told us that this would not be possible as the asset managers would not be
able to move away from their benchmark holdings (the initial target being £75bn). Once

the programme was announced, the Bank took steps to proactively discuss our operations
with market participants, to allay that initial scepticism. In the weeks that followed the
announcement in March 2009, we called in our contacts at the Gilt-edged Market Makers
and many of the larger asset managers, to explain the operations and to encourage them to
participate. The market collectively responded very positively, and the total value of offers
exceeded the targeted purchases in every auction undertaken.

A second operational objective was to ensure that purchases were at a fair market price.
We had to consider this against the backdrop of a heavy UK Government issuance
programme: we were alert to the risk that market participants might buy direct from the
Government’s Debt Management Office (DMO) and attempt to sell the same gilts to the
Bank at a higher price. The first mitigant was that the MPC set a targeted rate of purchases
initially three times faster than the DMO were issuing. In addition we incorporated several
features into the design of the operations:

i) We designed the operations as competitive (reverse) auctions that would deliver a
clearing price close to the market.
ii) We offered to buy from a bundle of 8-10 individual gilts in each operation not just a
single stock at a time. The selection of which gilts we then bought depended on the
prices offered. In that way, the purchases were less vulnerable to a ‘squeeze’ in any
one particular gilt.
iii) We eliminated from the operations any gilts which we knew the DMO were about
to issue or had issued in the previous week.

Maintaining the programme
I don’t want to imply that implementing and maintaining our programme of asset purchases
was straightforward operationally. Far from it. For example, the gilt market became
somewhat more dislocated as the Bank accumulated a large percentage of some of the
particular gilts in issue. To alleviate stress in the market, in August 2009 we started to lend
out, via the DMO, a proportion of the gilts the Bank had bought, in exchange for others that
had readier availability.10 The market responded rapidly to that development and, towards
the end of the £200bn programme, some contacts were telling us that gilt market liquidity

It was important that the gilts were not lent against cash, as that would have undone some of the intended
impact of the initial asset purchases.

had actually improved relative to March 2009.

One small point to clear up in relation to maintaining the programme is whether we should
be re-investing the interest receipts earned on the gilts. In the United States, the Federal
Open Market Committee recently decided that, to maintain the effectiveness of their asset
purchases they needed to re-invest the proceeds from maturing assets and interest receipts.
That reflects the fact that in large part they purchased (pass-through) mortgage-backed
securities where, in addition to receiving coupon payments, a proportion of the underlying
assets are constantly maturing or being pre-paid. Absent a re-investment programme, and
making assumptions about pre-payment rates, the stock of assets in the US programme
might have declined at a rate of around 17 ½ % pa.
In the UK purchase programme we bought nearly all gilts11, with at least 3 years to
maturity. The earliest gilt redemption won’t occur until 201312. We are receiving dividend
payments and those have currently cumulated to a value around 5% of the total stock of
purchases.13 These receipts were anticipated, are currently held in the Fund and will
contribute to repaying the original funding of the programme. A good argument can be
made that, to keep the monetary stimulus of asset purchases constant, this cash should be
re-invested in more gilts. We have taken the view that such fine-tuning is an unnecessary
complication at this stage. If the MPC want to undertake further purchases, it would be
straightforward to simply buy more gilts financed by issuing commercial bank reserves.

Eventual Exit Strategy
At this time, it is not clear whether the next step with the asset purchase programme is most
likely to be to sell the assets back or to buy more. The Bank is prepared for either but it
might be particularly helpful to set out in advance a few thoughts on the eventual exit
strategy.

11

The 3 month commercial paper purchased had nearly all matured by the end of the programme, and had
already been largely replaced by additional gilt purchases.
12
An earlier version of this speech, subsequently corrected, said the earliest gilt redemption would not occur
until the second half of 2012.
13
The cumulated dividends are not the profits on the portfolio, even before funding costs. Depending on such
factors as the yield curves at the date of issue and purchase, and the maturity of the gilts; the dividends and
market prices of the gilts are connected. See the DMO website for more information on changes in gilt prices:

After purchasing £200bn of assets in just under a year, the MPC paused its programme of
asset purchases in February 2010. The bulk of the medium-term impact from the asset
purchases should come from the stock of purchases not the flow. There will be
approximately £200bn extra money stimulus in the system, until the MPC decides to
withdraw it (or to increase it).

When the time does come to unwind the purchases, the MPC will face a number of difficult
decisions. First, it will have to decide at what point monetary policy should be tightened.
That decision will, as with any decision to expand the purchases further, be judged on a
month-by-month basis, taking into consideration developments in the economy, and the
outlook for our mandated target, CPI inflation. As the Governor said in June14, when the
MPC does want to tighten policy, it is most likely to raise interest rates first. Gilt sales
would be started later and conducted in an orderly programme over a period of time. That
would leave Bank Rate as the active or “marginal” instrument of monetary policy.

Second, the MPC will have to decide how fast to sell the gilts. Again, that would depend
on the outlook for inflation at the time, so we cannot commit now to any particular scale or
pace. But it is not in the interests of the UK economy to generate unnecessary volatility in
the gilt market. We will therefore be working closely with the DMO15 so as to plan any
extra sales operations that would be needed, with the intention of creating minimum
disruption to the market consistent with meeting the MPC’s desired exit path.

A portfolio of £200bn of gilt purchases has a market value which constantly varies as
market prices change. Currently there is a large ‘mark-to-market’ positive accounting
position, given the increase in gilt prices since the programme ended. But for the public
sector as a whole such fluctuations wash out: the (gilt) assets held by the Bank are the
liabilities of the Government and fluctuations in the value of one exactly offset the other in
terms of the public sector’s notional balance sheet. Nevertheless, once all the assets have
been sold, the Asset Purchase Facility may end up with a cash deficit and I want to make a
few points about that possible outcome.

The DMO’s objectives include: “to conduct its market operations, liaising as necessary with regulatory and
other bodies, with a view to maintaining orderly and efficient markets and promoting a liquid market for
gilts.” See page 31, ‘Debt and Reserves Management Report, 2010-11’, HMSO, March 2010.

In conducting the buying operations, it was in part an intended policy objective that we
would push up gilt prices and hence lower long-term interest rates. When we sell the gilts
back to the market, we will be tightening policy by pushing up on interest rates and hence
necessarily making gilts cheaper. The net effect will depend on the path of interest rates
relative to those expected at the time of each buying operation but, given the policy
objective, the result of the sales programme could easily be a cash deficit. But I want to
emphasise that such an outcome would not mean that the public finances have been made
worse off. The ongoing dynamic effects of the programme will have been to make it
cheaper for the Government to issue its debt in the interim. More importantly, over the
lifetime of the programme, it would have delivered great benefits to the public purse by
stimulating the economy and avoiding deflation: the increase in taxes received as a result
of higher nominal GDP should be an order of magnitude larger than any financial deficit on
the purchases themselves. To genuinely assess the impact on the taxpayer, one would have
to take these and other factors into account. The counterfactual story will never be known
precisely but the scale of the boost to the economy means that the all-round financial
benefits for the public finances should far outweigh any cash deficit that might be left at the
end of the programme.

The gilt sales programme will not be the only technical issue surrounding an exit from
unconventional policies. The Bank is also likely to re-introduce its reserves averaging
framework for commercial bank reserves, for example. That will give the bank the ability
to evaluate and then drain out any excess liquidity in the system. Unlike the US, we do not
need to develop new techniques to drain cash. The Bank can do that, for example, by
issuing one-week Bank of England bills as it did in 2008/09.

Conclusions
In this speech, I have commented on why the asset purchases were undertaken and how
well they worked. I have described some of the complicating factors in designing,
implementing and maintaining the operations. Finally I have covered some of the issues
we will face when we eventually come to sell the assets – noting that it is possible that we
yet might purchase more. The unconventional journey is not over yet!
