MONETARY POLICY AND THE MARKETS CONFERENCE

MONEY AND CREDIT: BANKING AND THE MACROECONOMY

Each month the MPC sets a policy rate, Bank Rate, that will prevail until our next policy
meeting. But no one – here today, in the market, or on the Committee – thinks that setting the
overnight money market rate for the coming 30 days can be enough to steer demand conditions
and maintain stable inflation. Rather, policy works on the basis of expectations of the path of the
Bank Rate in the future, and of how our policy settings will vary according to economic
conditions: the so­called ‘reaction function’.

Perceptions of the reaction function therefore matter a lot and a great deal of effort goes into
being transparent about the three inputs: the Committee’s objective; the MPC’s views on the
shocks to demand and supply affecting the economy; and our views on how the economy works
and how our policy settings affect it. This conference is focused on one important element of
this: the role of financial markets in the setting and transmission of monetary policy. That is
covered in the Bank’s publications on how the economy works, including the Committee’s 1999
paper on the Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), and books describing the models used
in forecasting.1 But those high­level descriptions miss out an awful lot about how the real and
financial parts of the economy connect. Financial variables are limited to the short­term interest
rate, the exchange rate, and equities. Nothing on the role of long­maturity interest rates, or on
credit spreads and risk premia – which misses out a whole universe of financial asset prices.
Very little on credit more generally. Next to nothing on money. And nothing at all on the role of
bank intermediation.

These gaps were perhaps underlined by a degree of confusion amongst commentators about the
way in which Money and Credit featured somewhat more prominently in the Committee’s
discussions during the backend of 2006 and into this year (Chart 1). With both having been
strong for a while, some asked whether this marked some kind of change in the reaction function,
implying a greater stress on nominal variables.

Given the near identity of deposits and bank lending, Money and Credit are often used almost
inseparably, even interchangeably, with wider measures of non­bank credit looked at only when
assessing the health of corporate and household sector balance sheets. But in some

3
circumstances one can do better to approach things the other way round, starting with general
credit conditions, examining the interactions of non­bank and bank lending, and then broad
money as a (partial) counterpart to M4L. My remarks today will follow that structure, which
will provide a framework for some observations about the current tightening in credit conditions,
as well as about the preceding expansion.

Credit

Credit is, of course, vital to any economy, enabling households and firms to make choices about
whether to bring forward or defer spending from income. There are conditions in which it would
play no active role, passively reflecting cyclical fluctuations in output, employment and inflation.
In a world of more or less complete transparency between borrowers and lenders, very low
transactions costs, and very low risk aversion, access to credit would not be rationed; and ex ante
yields on financial assets, including loans and bonds, would not embody risk premia. So if
households and firms wanted to bring forward spending in the face of shocks to the economy,
they would be able to do so restricted only by their need to remain solvent.

But nobody believes that that is a description of the real world in which households and
companies manage their affairs. Both are, to a greater or lesser degree, rationed in their access to
credit, given that borrowers know a great deal more about their conditions and prospects than do
risk­averse lenders, and that lenders face obstacles in ensuring that borrowers honour their
contracts.2 The availability, price and terms of credit– whether unsecured or secured – will be
sensitive to a range of factors, including assessments of the idiosyncratic risks of a particular
borrower, and the risks common across borrowers. Variations in these factors give rise to the
possibility of a credit cycle.

A borrower’s ability to pledge collateral can help to overcome the problems of ‘asymmetric
information’ and enforceability, by evidencing its net worth and giving it a continuing stake in its
contract with the lender. This can give rise to the so­called ‘financial accelerator’ channel of the
Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), in which monetary policy works partly by affecting
lending terms through its effect on asset values and so the net worth of borrowers.3

4
But credit conditions also depend on the access to credit of the lenders themselves. There is an
important distinction here between intermediation across bank balance sheets and via the capital
markets, although as I shall describe it turns out to be blurred.

Total credit: capital markets and securitisation

For the moment, I shall put that distinction to one side in order to focus on total credit. A series
of environmental changes over the past decade or so have affected the quantity and price of
credit generally. Greater macroeconomic stability, and perceptions that it will persist more or
less uninterrupted, probably increased the supply of credit; and by reducing risk premia, may
have increased demand too (Diagram A)

Other developments are more likely to have worked purely through credit supply. The most
obvious is the growth of instruments such as credit derivatives and securitisation, associated with
an increased role for rating agencies in monitoring credit risk. This was in effect a shock to
technology, making portfolios transferable. By offering the prospect of better meeting desired
risk profiles and by separating origination from investment, it has brought more non­bank
financial institutions, and so more capital resources, into the credit markets, increasing the supply
of credit (Diagram B).

This seems to have been borne out in the significant shift in actual credit quantities and prices up
to the middle of this year.

In the United Kingdom, non­bank lenders have accounted for a greater share of credit extension
to both the household and corporate sectors (Charts 2­4).

A lot of that has been securitised (Chart 5). For the household sector, spreads on securitised
portfolios of both secured and unsecured credit fell between 2003 and 2005 (Chart 6). That will
have contributed to the fall in effective rates on the underlying mortgages and personal loans
(Chart 7).

The same broad picture holds for the corporate sector (Chart 8). An illustrative decomposition
suggests that, especially for sub­investment grade borrowers, the compression of spreads could

5
not be explained solely by reduced compensation for default risk, with the excess possibly
reflecting lower liquidity premia (Chart 9).4

These falls in spreads were material relative to the changes in the MPC’s Bank Rate and to the
risk­free yield curve. For example, in the latest ‘policy cycle’, we increased Bank Rate by 125bp
over 11 months from August 2006. During that period, effective rates on new mortgages rose by
closer to 50bp. In other words, from around 2003, monetary policy needed to take account of a
progressive loosening of credit conditions.

The tables have now turned. Spreads have risen; the issuance of securitised portfolios of
household loans has collapsed; corporate bond issuance has fallen (Charts 10­11). It is pretty
clear that, for the time being, there has been an adverse shift in the supply of credit from the non­
banking sector. In part, that seems to be due to investors becoming less confident that they can
base decisions about exposures to complex credit portfolios on rating agency ratings; this is akin
to lenders deciding that their monitoring of risk was less good than they thought. In part, it is
due to various types of non­bank investor in credit finding themselves facing actual or incipient
liquidity pressures. Both as cause and effect, liquidity in the capital markets is impaired. This is
apparent in the opening up of a so­called ‘negative basis’ between the spreads on corporate bond
and on equivalent credit­default swaps, which unbundle the transfer of credit risk from the
provision of funds and so are less affected by liquidity hoarding (Chart 12).

A twin­engine financial system?
At various times over the past decade or so, it had been argued5 that the macroeconomy as a
whole should be more resilient to shocks to a financial system with ‘twin engines’ – combining
capital markets with banking system intermediation of savings and credit. The argument is that
when the capital markets are impaired, banking can take more of the burden, and vice versa. I
have a good deal of sympathy for this view – but not for all circumstances. It rather overstates
the independence of capital markets and banking, as recent developments graphically
demonstrate.

First, whether through financing the purchase of credit assets by leveraged funds or warehousing
portfolios prior to sale or providing ‘liquidity lines’ to conduits and other investment vehicles,
the banking system puts its capital and liquidity behind the distribution of credit risk to the wider

6
asset­manager universe. As the official sector stressed over recent years, it is important to be
clear about the circumstances in which risk can flow back to the banking system. 6

Second, the ‘twin engines’ view draws too absolute a line between banks and non­bank financial
intermediaries. Alongside other asset managers, banks have been material investors in
securitised credit. In some respects, it may be more useful to distinguish between intermediaries
on the basis of whether they undertake some combination of maturity transformation, leveraging
their balance sheets, and mark­to­market valuations. Banks are not alone in having these
characteristics, and so there can be common shocks to bank and non­bank investors. In a recent
series of papers,7 Hyun Shin has argued that balance sheet management of this kind amplifies the
credit cycle. That sounds like the ‘financial accelerator’ model, except that Shin’s position is
that the outcomes can exceed those warranted by fundamentals. His argument is that in the
upswing of a business cycle, the rise in asset values increases the accounting net worth of banks
and other intermediaries, enabling them to leverage up their balance sheets. This expands credit;
and increases the liquidity in capital markets, reducing liquidity premia embodied in asset prices;
and so on. And when the music stops, the process can be reversed as falls in asset values,
leverage and liquidity feed on each other. (For Shin, the villain is mark­to­market accounting,
although I would not want its virtues in reducing forbearance to be overlooked.)

Thirdly, the ‘twin engines’ view may place insufficient weight on banks having remained the
principal originators of credit, given that small firms and households cannot issue bonds directly
into the capital markets. It has been argued that the growth of markets for securitising loan
portfolios made banks less relevant to overall credit conditions, and so to the business cycle,
because a bank’s ability to originate credit becomes less intimately bound up with its own
financial strength.8 But if, as currently, the capital markets’ appetite for securitised credit
diminishes, a larger proportion of loans will after all remain on the balance sheets of banks.

All this brings back into focus the potential macroeconomic relevance of bank lending.

Bank lending

The economic literature on the ‘bank lending’ channel of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism
explores the conditions under which a tightening of monetary policy causes the terms on bank
lending to tighten over and above the increase in risk­free short­term real rates. The literature

7
has typically assumed (i) that a monetary policy tightening is effected by the central bank
withdrawing reserves from the system (or slowing the pace of reserves injection); (ii) that banks
are required to hold a proportion of transactions deposits in reserves, so that reduced reserves
provision entails slower deposit growth; and (iii) that they do not have unrestricted access to
liabilities that are not subject to reserves requirements, and so cannot fill the gap left by slower
deposit growth and must, instead, slow loan growth, which they do by tightening credit
conditions.9 The first two steps seem archaic. We effect monetary policy changes by
controlling the price not the quantity of central bank money in the system; and, in the UK, banks
choose their own reserves targets rather than having them determined by a balance sheet ratio of
some kind.

But the third plank in these models – restricted access to non­deposit liabilities, whether
capital­like or not – plainly is still relevant today. In a world of asymmetric information, banks
do not have unrestricted access to resources, and we do not believe that a bank’s lending
behaviour is invariant to its capital gearing or to the composition of its liabilities. 10 We do,
therefore, face questions about the extent to which a shock to banks’ liquidity or capital
resources can bring about a shift in credit conditions with macroeconomic effects that, other
things being equal, monetary policy should seek to offset in order to maintain aggregate demand
in line with aggregate supply.

Over the past 15 years or so, when banks have seemed anything but restricted, easier access to
liquidity or capital may have brought about a progressive relaxation of bank lending conditions.
That this featured in commentary on monetary policy rather less than the recent manifest
tightening may say no more than that sharp contractions attract more attention than gradual
expansions. In a similar vein, on the whole, research does better at identifying these ‘credit
channel’ mechanisms in the context of particular stressed episodes than in longer­run averages. 11

Be that as it may, it is beyond doubt that there has recently been an adverse shock to bank
balance sheets – involving capital, liquidity, and a potent ‘asymmetric’ information mechanism
affecting a wide range of banks. I will pick out four elements in the story, involving liquidity,
counterparty­credit risk and capital.

First, near closure of the capital markets for leveraged loans, conduit and SIV commercial paper,
and RMBS has left banks whose business model is ‘originate and distribute’ unexpectedly

8
holding on to loans and, in addition, facing the prospect of having to take assets back on to their
balance sheets. The consequent reintermediation is a hit to both capital ratios and liquidity, as
the banks have bigger books to fund. For these reasons alone, big picture, banks responded
from August onwards by tightening loan terms and hoarding liquidity.

But the story does not end there. The second element is that access to resources (uninsured
deposits) from outside the banking sector has become more restricted since the summer. While
the new risk­transfer instruments have plainly dispersed risks, lack of ex ante disclosure left
market participants highly uncertain about the scale and distribution of losses across the banking
sector itself. On top of that, open­ended investment vehicles that have (or may have) themselves
invested in structured­finance paper have felt compelled to preserve liquidity, to guard against
redemption risk. And one significant source of demand for bank hybrid­capital instruments over
the past half­decade or so, the SIVs, has been turned off due to their own funding problems.
Taken together, the upshot for the banking system has been a shortening in the maturity of
wholesale deposits, and an intermittent tightening of access to hybrid capital instruments (Chart
13).

Coming on top of an involuntary increase in risk­weighted assets and reduced access to term
liquidity, the third component of the shock, apparent since late autumn, has been some actual
impairment of capital resources. Large banks especially have progressively written down the
values of structured­finance assets, reflecting deterioration in the underlying position of the US
household sector and in the values of a wide range of leveraged instruments. But the adjustment
is drawn out, partly due to uncertainty about appropriate mark­to­market valuations given the
impaired liquidity in ABS markets. To avoid this process amplifying the credit cycle,12 some
replenishment of common equity may be needed, and has already begun.

The fourth element in the story, underway since August, has been distributional. Banks
relatively reliant on wholesale funding have bid up for funds. But doing so has been taken as an
adverse signal, prompting further rationing of wholesale money market lending at term
maturities and potentially deterring the strong from entering the market; this is what is known as
a ‘Lemons’ problem13. In the United Kingdom, since August, mortgage approvals and secured
lending have declined by more at the medium­sized mortgage banks and specialist lenders than
at the largest UK banks, partly due to Northern Rock (Charts 14­15). This was symmetric. Their
mortgage portfolios grew faster over the previous years. All told, this looks like a manifestation

9
of the Kashyap and Stein finding, in various non­UK settings, that lending is more cyclically
variable at banks that start off with weaker balance sheets;14 or, as I would prefer to put it, with
concentrated income streams and/or funding sources.

Won’t the macroeconomic effect of this be dampened by the bigger and more diversified banks
picking up the slack? It is important to distinguish the longer term from the near term.

The longer­term impact will depend on whether the structure of the industry shifts. The
securitisation boom seems to have altered the terms of trade in UK banking for a while. By
reducing reliance on retail deposits, it reduced barriers to entry. Lenders’ margins fell (Chart
16), and credit conditions in the UK mortgage market eased. Conversely, the painful reminder
that undiversified funding and income sources may leave a bank unusually vulnerable will
probably bring about another shock to the structure of the market. The persistent tightening in
mortgage credit that that would bring was a factor in the MPC’s November projections.

In the near term, the extent to which the big or more diversified banks fill the gap will depend on
the extent to which they too preserve capital and liquidity in the face of the harsh environment I
have described.

Money, or bank intermediation

So far I have focused entirely on credit. Where does this leave money (or Money), the starting
point for much traditional monetary analysis?

Well, much that I have said about banks – their capacity, in the short run, to lever up their
balance sheets and expand credit at will; their role in providing liquidity insurance to investment
vehicles and corporates – turns precisely on their liabilities being money. And for this reason,
banks are after all decisively different from other intermediaries.

As transactions balances and so the means of exchange in our payments system, the moneyness
of bank deposits lies at the core of credit intermediation. Subject only but crucially to confidence
in their soundness, banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customer’s current
account, which can be paid away to wherever the borrower wants by the bank ‘writing a cheque
on itself’. That is, banks extend credit by creating money. This ‘money creation’ process is

10
constrained: by their need to manage the liquidity risk – from the withdrawal of deposits and the
draw­down of back­up lines – to which it exposes them. 15 Adequate capital and liquidity,
including for stressed circumstances, are the essential ingredients for maintaining confidence. 16

If that excursion into the realm of financial stability appears to have drifted away from the
immediate issue of Money, it is because the health of bank balance sheets is relevant to both the
demand for money and its supply, even if this is apparent only occasionally.

Charles Goodhart has already, and very usefully, stressed the importance of recovering the
notion of shocks to the supply of broad money. 17

In the main, however, in terms of the

underlying drivers, we are talking here of shifts in the supply of broad money caused by shocks
to the supply of bank lending: banks create money by extending credit (Diagram C). And as
discussed earlier, key drivers in terms of bank balance sheet growth include the variables that
underpin bankers’ confidence in borrowers; and, conversely, confidence in banks themselves. It
should come as no surprise that the ‘credit channel’ macroeconomic literature converged with
bankers in focusing on the tangible collateral available from borrowers, and on their own capital
and liquidity (which includes the ex ante and ex post terms on which they have access to central
bank reserves).

Some important things can be said about this account of shifts in the supply of broad money.

First, in contrast to the textbook account of shocks to the Money supply via the proverbial
helicopter drop of base money (pound notes), firms and households are not caught in a bind
where, in aggregate, they are forced to hold the increased supply of broad money, even if it
exceeds demand. Following a shock to the supply of credit, in which some people or companies
become less credit constrained, it will be open to others to reduce their existing borrowing as the
extra money circulates around the economy via the purchase of goods, services and financial
assets.

Second, and more important, the shocks to credit supply are, in themselves, real not nominal
shocks. And like other real shocks, causing changes in the balance of Aggregate Demand and
Aggregate Supply, there is a nominal effect only if monetary policy does not respond via
alterations to the path of short­term interest rates to keep the economy on a stable path and in line
with the inflation target.

11

Absent an appropriate policy response, the easing in monetary conditions would in time feed into
inflation through an expansion of nominal spending. In the first instance, the expansion of
‘liquidity’ represented by faster money growth may sometimes work through asset prices. That
is because with imperfect substitution between different kinds of financial assets, relative risk
premia may be altered, which in turn may affect borrowing conditions in capital markets.18

With an appropriate policy response, what should we expect to see in bank balance sheets, in
broad money growth, following a credit­supply shock? It might be that the path for broad money
should be unaltered in the medium term. In other words, a persistent acceleration (or
deceleration) of M4 would be indicative of a nominal shock, jeopardising achievement of the
inflation target. The world is not so simple, however. The underlying drivers of the change in
the supply of bank lending, and so in broad money, may also bring about shifts in the demand for
money, validating a different level for real money balances – perhaps most obviously, if
investment and so the economy’s productive capacity were affected.

For some underlying shocks, it is probably better to think about the effects on banking
intermediation rather than simply on bank lending. Faced with a change in their costs and
opportunities, bankers might sometimes be able to adjust the terms on either their assets or their
liabilities (or both). Currently, banks have incurred an adverse shock to their wholesale funding
(Chart 17). The evidence so far suggests that, as well as tightening terms for borrowers, they are
improving rates offered on retail deposits.

Where does that leave us on Money? It is clear enough from the long­run relationship between
money growth and inflation that prolonged shifts in money growth can be an amber light
(Chart 18). And possible liquidity effects mean that, through risk premia, shifts in the quantity
of money may feed back into financial asset markets and so into broader credit conditions. But
there are no ‘easy wins’ when it comes to analysing Money demand and supply. 19

Money and credit in the current conjuncture

Those challenges are certainly apparent right now. Judging from a combination of market
intelligence, surveys and prices, there is no doubt that credit conditions for both households and
firms have tightened materially. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey, published for the

12
first time in September, recorded a clear tightening in availability of credit to corporates over the
previous quarter. A month later, a mini­survey unsurprisingly revealed tighter conditions for
households too.20 Spreads on corporate and household credit are already higher across the
board; and for risky borrowers, financing costs have risen notwithstanding the fall in risk­free
yields.

Since August, the MPC has stressed, however, that it will not be sufficient in these circumstances
to look solely at the price of credit, as there could be increased quantity rationing. The standard
view is that households and small firms are more likely to be adversely affected in such
circumstances than large firms, which typically have greater access to capital markets. But as
this disturbance affected the wholesale loan markets, we will need to monitor conditions for
corporate bond and loan issuance. Indeed, we will need to look at total credit, and carefully
across different sectors to track the impact of the tightening. But timely and rich data are
available on just bank lending. And interpreting them is not straightforward given the nature of
the shock to the system. If reintermediation is significant, banks will be taking back on to their
balance sheets conduit and investment vehicle paper or just holding onto loans for longer than
usual before they can be sold onto the capital markets. It cannot be ruled out that, for a while,
the M4L growth rate may deceive as to the underlying pace of credit expansion in the economy.

That is important because, in a nutshell, the turmoil in financial markets is not just a ‘City’ event.
How potent it will be macroeconomically will depend on how long current conditions persist,
and the feedback loop between the financial economy and the real economy.

As to its persistence, necessary conditions for an alleviation of the current strains in credit
markets are probably at least twofold. First, that the US housing and household debt markets
stabilise. Second, that banks and other financial intermediaries recognise impairments to asset
values, so that uncertainties about counterparty credit risks begin to reduce.

On the financial­real economy interaction, we must try to avoid a vicious circle in which tighter
liquidity conditions, lower asset values, impaired capital resources, reduced credit supply, and
slower aggregate demand feed back on each other. A variety of policy responses are possible.
The announcement yesterday by central banks of co­ordinated action via term auctions to
alleviate pressure in financing markets is directed at that. Second, regulatory authorities around
the world are monitoring banks’ liquidity and capital positions, including in the context of Basel

13
II. And, thirdly, monetary policy also can in principle play a role, through what is effectively a
‘financial accelerator’ working through bank balance sheets, where that is consistent with
maintaining stable inflation in the medium term.

In the UK, the starting point has been robust domestic demand; the leveraged­buyout sector
aside, generally healthy corporate balance sheets; somewhat more vulnerable household balance
sheets;21 and potentially stretched commercial and residential property prices.

At the Committee’s November meeting, I explored the case for an ‘insurance cut’ addressed to
the downside risks from tightening credit conditions. The case for such a cut was strengthened
by Bank Rate, at 5¾%, standing at a level that was most probably mildly restrictive. But that
had to be weighed against the upward pressures on inflation stemming largely from the rise in
energy and other commodity prices. Our November projections seemed to me likely to validate
the expectation already embodied in the money market curve that Bank Rate would over time be
lowered, representing some offset to the tightening in liquidity and credit premia. That being so,
on balance, I concluded that an immediate cut was not necessary; and that ‘no change’ would
give the Committee a valuable opportunity to explain in the Inflation Report the implications of
both the credit and commodity shocks, underlining that the Committee remains focused on
anchoring inflation expectations and so achieving the inflation target over the medium term.

Looking ahead, I noted the importance of distinguishing between, on the one hand, the passing
through into the macroeconomy of the shocks that had already occurred to credit conditions and
to commodity prices; and, on the other hand, the possibility of new shocks on either or both
fronts.

That was my starting point for our December meeting, the minutes of which will be published
next week.

Summary and conclusions

Let me try to pull together some of my central themes.

14
I have stressed that we should take care to avoid talking about money when we mean credit. In a
similar spirit, we should be clear when we mean total credit and when bank lending, but without
assuming the two are divorced.

I have also stressed the need for attention to the underlying drivers of credit conditions
throughout the economic cycle. In today’s financial system, we may well need richer data on
credit quantities and flows outside the banking sector, perhaps along the lines of the US Flow of
Funds statistics. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey is also designed to give us better
qualitative information to put alongside the quantity and price data. Even so, as with asset
prices more generally, we will sometimes find it hard to distinguish between changes in credit
conditions warranted by fundamentals and those that are not. Failure to recognise fundamentally
warranted and sustainable shifts would deplete welfare. But it is distinctly uncomfortable for the
world’s central banks to rely entirely on mopping up after a bubble bursts: one imbalance can
lead to another.22 The central banking community does not yet have a satisfactory way through
this dilemma.

And Money? It occupies one end of the liquidity spectrum, and so changes in the quantity of
money might potentially affect risk premia, and so credit conditions more generally. Gauging
that is a formidable challenge. As an input to policy, there is just no alternative to getting one’s
hands dirty in analysing the monetary data.

With an institutional rather than functional

definition of broad money, special care is needed not to be misled by shifts in the demand for
money from the plethora of non­bank financial institutions. This is important if we are to use
money as an indicator of nominal trends alongside survey and financial­market­based measures
of inflation expectations.

That brings me back to where I began: with our policy reaction function. Occasionally the
markets will be surprised by our policy decisions. But we should do all we can to avoid
confusion about how we think about the economy and about monetary policy strategy. In the
spring, my own view of the signals from broad money had not altered materially. So today I
have tried to explain how I think about money, credit and the connections between them. That
has provided a framework for some observations on the current conjuncture, underlining the
need for careful attention to conditions in the banking system. Central banks should be, and need
to be, well placed to undertake that analysis, which has rarely been more important than now.

needs to be supplemented with a mechanism that somehow impedes checks and balances from
preventing the overshooting of fundamentals.

In a Modigliani­Miller world of perfect capital markets, a bank’s overall cost of funds is independent
of its capital and funding structure. As a result the level of bank capital and the balance of wholesale
and retail funding are not relevant to bank lending decisions and so do not affect the monetary
transmission mechanism.

Akerlof, G. A. (1970), ‘The market for ‘lemons’: quality uncertainty and the market mechanism’,
Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 84, No. 3, pp. 488­500. A market for ‘lemons’ issue arises when
informational deficiencies give rise to uncertainty about the true quality of a product. In such
circumstances, buyers choose to pay only average prices for goods that carry the risk of sellers
overstating their true quality. As a result, sellers of good products, having little incentive to participate
in such markets, are driven out by those sellers of poor quality products. The most common example of
the problem is the market for used new cars. Rationing in the interbank markets is discussed by

rationing’, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Economics Working Papers.

There is an echo here of a channel stressed by Brunner & Melter, but with the impulse coming from
the central bank’s short­term interest rate rather than the quantity of reserves, and the transmission into
risk premia and so other asset prices coming via the expected path of the policy rate and broad money
rather than via narrow money.
19
Perhaps nothing illustrates this as cleanly as the advent of credit derivatives. Derivatives of any kind
unbundle funding (and so liquidity risk) from the underlying risk to which an agent is seeking exposure
via a particular contract. So a credit derivative unbundles credit risk from funding. This further
complicates interpretation of the bank lending data (M4L). Imagine that, due to their customer
networks and screening capability, banks originate all credit, but that they use credit­default swaps to
shed a great portion of the credit risk via CDS to non­bank financial institutions. In the limit, this
would be a world in which M4L correctly measured (bank) lending and M4 was one useful measure of
‘liquidity’. But it would also be a world in which shocks to credit conditions from capital and risk
appetite worked largely through non­bank lenders, and in which shocks to liquidity worked largely
through depositor confidence in the banking system. In the real world, this story underlines the need to
look at total credit, and to analyse the monetary data with finesse.
