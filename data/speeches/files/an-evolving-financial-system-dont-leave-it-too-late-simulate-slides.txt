Conference on non-bank financial institutions and financial stability

I am grateful to David Baumslag, Pavel Chichkanov, Sinem Hacioglu, David Mallaburn, Laura Silvestri, Henry Tanner, Jagdish Tripathy, Nick Vause and Michael Yoganayagam for their assistance with
preparing this speech.

Ten years ago, a financial crisis sideswiped households and
businesses.

Back then, the financial system was fragile.
A non-bank system dominated by shadow banks …

Back then, the financial system was fragile.
Shadow banks didn’t contain problems, they spread them ...

Back then, the financial system was fragile.
Derivative markets spread problems too. They created an opaque web of connections.
Losses could spread through the network.

Back then, the financial system was fragile.
And the banking system didn’t have enough of its own money on the line to absorb
the resulting losses.
Losses vs. capital for major UK banks(1)

The result: taxpayer bail‐outs and a credit
crunch for households and businesses.

The banking system is now stronger.
Banks can absorb crisis losses with their own capital.
Losses vs. capital for major UK banks(1)

The result: a banking system that can serve
households and businesses even in testing
times.

Derivative markets are safer.
Webs of connections have been stripped back. And participants must put up security.

default swaps(1)

Posting of collateral (margin) means
that if one party goes bust, the other
isn’t left with a loss
This is similar to using a house as
security on a mortgage

New collateral must be posted every
day as markets move and the value of
derivatives change

And the system is now more diverse.
Shadow banks have shrunk and been reformed …

A more diverse system can be a safer system.

But it doesn’t guarantee financial stability …

A financial system that can serve
households and businesses in bad
times as well as good
… so we must be vigilant.

And vigilant we are. To firesale risks especially.
Firesale risk: The risk that non-banks are forced into selling assets quickly, driving prices
down and volatility up …

Sudden cash calls, for example when:

Derivative exposures
change
Investors redeem their
money at short notice

Lower prices
Volatile
markets
Higher
borrowing costs
Restricted
credit supply

… and harming households and businesses

Our approach to monitoring the risk:
Don’t wait, simulate.

Not: what has gone wrong before?

Instead: given how non-banks have changed, how
could they harm the economy in the future?

Simulation 1: Cash calls on derivative positions.

How big might be the calls non-banks face for margin to square off derivative
positions after markets move?

Do they have the cash or liquid assets to meet those calls?

Or might they be forced into firesales?

Summary
The financial system is stronger, simpler and safer than ten years ago.

Safer non-banks have taken the place of dangerous shadow banks.
This diversity can be a source of strength, but we have to be vigilant about firesale
risks.
These risks need monitoring. Not by asking whether they have appeared, but by
asking whether they could.
Don’t wait. Simulate.
