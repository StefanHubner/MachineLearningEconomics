Chart 1 – Dispersion in US money market rates

Reproduced from Duffie and Krishnamurthy (2016).
The dispersion index (shown in blue) is the weighted mean absolute deviation of the cross-sectional distribution of selected money
market rates. The adjusted index (shown in red) is adjusted by subtracting the spread between an unsecured overnight benchmark rate
and a secured overnight benchmark rate. See Duffie and Krishnamurthy (2016) for full and important details on data and calculation.

• An index of rate dispersion in US money markets shows an increase
following the introduction of the Supplementary Leverage Ratio

‘Net percentage balance’ is calculated as the difference between the balance of lenders reporting that, on a scale of 1-5, the
market was functioning very poorly (1) to very well (5).The net percentage balances are scaled to lie between ±100: more
extreme responses (1 and 5) attract a weight of 100%, less extreme responses (2 and 4) attract a weight of 50% and central
responses (3) attract a weight of zero.

• The net balance of survey respondents who think secured markets
are functioning well has declined in recent years

• Comparing the leverage ratios and risk-weighted capital ratios of banks
who failed during the financial crisis and banks who survived shows that
the leverage ratio was a better predictor of failure.

Level of deposit rates in 2013 Q4
(a) Effective household deposit rate on new business, unless otherwise stated, and change between 2013 Q4 and the three months
to May 2016 as a percentage of the change in the corresponding maturity of swap rate.
(b) Includes interest rates for overnight deposits, and deposits with a maturity of less than one year, between one and two years
and greater than two years.
(c) Data are for the three months to June 2016.
(d) Outstanding interest rates for deposits with a maturity of less than three months, between three months and one year, between
one and two years and greater than two years.
(e) Published rates for new sight deposits, and on two and three-year cash bonds.
(f) Percentage of pass-through is that implied by bivariate regression on the data for other European countries shown in this chart.

• Pass through of risk free rates to retail deposit rates tends to be lower when
interest rates are lower
