Section 1: Introduction
1

Commercial banks play a pivotal role in the economy. They facilitate payments

and the smooth transfer of goods and services, and they match savers who may lack
detailed knowledge of borrowers and who (generally) want to be able to withdraw
their money at short notice, with borrowers who often wish to repay their loans over a
longer term horizon. This ‘maturity transformation’ performed by banks is essential
to allow capital to be invested in a productive way to support economic growth. But
by offering such maturity transformation, banks are inherently exposed to liquidity
risk – the risk that a bank is unable to meet its commitments should depositors attempt
to withdraw their funds ahead of the bank’s capacity to repay them.
2

As many bankers through the ages have found to their cost, the key objective for

the management of liquidity risk is the retention of confidence. A bank may be wellcapitalised and profitable with a sound loan book, but if depositors lose confidence in
the bank’s ability to provide their funds as and when they request them, the
crystallisation of liquidity risk can bring down an otherwise viable institution in short
order. Once underway, a liquidity crisis can be very hard to stop. Adverse dynamics
may feed back on themselves as the limited offer of immediate, full repayment awaits
those first to the exit. Moreover, liquidity risk can be triggered through the realisation
of other risks, such as the disclosure of large and unexpected trading losses, or the
discovery of fraudulent activity within the bank. But it is just as likely to develop
independently through the simple combination of an inherently vulnerable funding
position and a sudden (and not necessarily rational) turn in market sentiment.
3

These considerations illustrate why it is of crucial importance to build strong

defences against this risk, particularly as the macro-economic and financial market
developments of the past few years have in my view led to an increase in many banks’
overall vulnerability to liquidity risk. And whilst this changing environment has led
to distinct improvements in banks’ efficiency and management of other risks, liquidity
risk management and supervision have not always kept pace. Recent events have
clearly demonstrated that the current defences have proved wanting, with banks
insufficiently prepared for a period of severe liquidity strain. The experience of the
past few months already suggests a number of key lessons for liquidity risk

2

management and supervision which I will cover later. But I would first like to review
the impact of market developments in recent years for liquidity risk management.
Section II: Changing environment and business models
4

How then has the financial environment changed in the past few years, and why

has this led to a greater vulnerability to liquidity risk? The decade leading up to July
2007 has been described as a period of great stability: around the world, economic
conditions were dominated by low inflation, low nominal yields, and lower volatility
of the economic cycle. The benign macro background was associated with a fall in
financial market volatility. And advances in technology spurred a wave of financial
innovation and the development of new products offering improvements in the
tailoring and matching of risks to investors’ risk appetite. This combination of factors
encouraged investors to seek out riskier investments in search of higher returns – the
“search for yield”.
5

One feature of this “search for yield” was the rapid expansion of structured

financial instruments; for example, where individual loans are packaged into tradable
securities, such as residential or commercial mortgage-backed securities
(RMBS/CMBS), or where the risk of a pool of loans is packaged into complex
securities offering different levels of exposure to the potential losses in the pool (a
collateralised debt obligation – CDO). Moreover, new products emerged which also
supported the transfer, hedging and dispersion of risks, such as credit derivatives.
And the use of these instruments strengthened the inter-relationships between
financial market participants across the globe: greater integration of markets went
hand in hand with the acceleration of financial innovation and rapid growth of market
activity.
6

These developments helped stimulate important changes in banks’ business

models. Constraints on growth were eased as funding sources widened. Many banks
took advantage of new sources of wholesale funding available from securitisation the packaging of loans into instruments which could be sold on in financial markets.
In many cases, assets were routinely transferred into off-balance sheet vehicles which
funded themselves through asset-backed commercial paper, with the sponsoring bank

3

providing a back-up liquidity line. By applying this “originate and distribute” model,
banks tapped a new source of funding on a large scale. More traditional and stable
sources of funding, such as retail deposits, declined in importance (Chart 1). In
addition, many banks saw opportunities to generate new sources of revenue and fee
income by developing and deepening their activities in international capital markets.
7

Innovation has provided banks with greater opportunities to hedge and diversify

risks. For example, a regionally-based bank in country A can easily lower its
geographical concentration, for example by selling credit risk to other investors who
had not previously been able to access such exposures, and/or by purchasing exposure
to credit risk elsewhere. The resulting dispersal of risk allows banks to diversify their
risk profile as well as their sources of revenue. Providing that the gain from
diversification outweighs the increased cost of credit assessment, as banks take on
exposure to entities where they have no banking relationship, and that risks are priced
fully and appropriately, such innovation should improve market efficiency and lower
the cost of intermediation and of capital.
8

These changes in the financial environment, however, resulted in banks increasing

their exposure to liquidity risk. Banks originated large volumes of long-term loans in
the expectation that they could be quickly and readily sold on, but leaving them with
additional funding risks if they could not. Contingent liquidity lines to securitisation
conduits and special purpose vehicles rose rapidly with little expectation that they
would be drawn. Exposures to higher yielding complex structured products rose, with
market participants failing to recognise sufficiently that the high yields offered by
such products were in part compensation for higher liquidity and market risk and that
prospective risk-adjusted returns were much lower than might first appear from their
short historic track record. Moreover, in buoyant market conditions, the
compensation for liquidity risk itself was bid down to negligible levels by early 2007
(Chart 2). By that stage, many market participants recognised that compensation for
risk-taking was too low, but judged that the business risks of exiting lines outweighed
the financial risks of continuing to write new business.2 Firms became over-confident
in their ability to hedge or exit positions if conditions changed, failing to recognise

2

See Bank of England Financial Stability Reports July 2006 and April 2007.

4

that many participants would be attempting to do the same and that market liquidity
would then evaporate. Indeed, given a change in sentiment, the increased integration
of financial markets transmits risks just as much as it disperses them.
9

Banks’ funding thus became increasingly vulnerable to a sudden shift in financial

market conditions. As covered extensively elsewhere,3 the crystallisation of this risk
in August 2007 led to a sharp decline in liquidity across a wide range of markets (as
shown in Chart 3). Funding pressures intensified as asset managers lowered demand
for asset-backed securities and complex products more broadly, to lower risks and to
guard against pressures from their investors for early redemption. And as banks
attempted to fund contingent claims, liquidity in wholesale term markets dried up adding to the strain. A number of institutions across the globe, such as Northern
Rock, IKB and Bear Stearns have succumbed to the pressure, necessitating public
sector intervention to support financial stability.
Section III: Defences against liquidity risks
10 Banks have a range of defences to a sudden decline in the availability of
wholesale funds. Recent developments have highlighted a number of limitations in
these defences in addressing the recent system-wide liquidity shock.
11 One potential counter-measure to liquidity pressures is to transform illiquid assets
into cash. So in the event of increased funding pressures, a number of banks had
planned to use securitisation techniques more intensively to liquefy assets such as
mortgages. Such a counter-measure may well succeed if a single firm faces a
liquidity problem on its own. But of course this approach fails completely when the
source of the change in market conditions is a lowering of global demand for
securitised products and a widespread closure of term lending markets.
12 Another approach is to bid for higher retail deposits. That is likely to take time as
many individual retail savers react only slowly to changes in relative interest rates and
as banks offer higher rates on term deposits to limit their movement. More
importantly, this approach can only succeed by offering rates above those of
3

competitors, thereby eroding margins. And in an environment of general liquidity
strain, competitors are likely to follow suit to protect their market share. So the
impact on each bank in the medium term is likely to be limited to a share in any rise in
aggregate retail savings.
13 Faced with restrictions on raising liquidity, a bank must respond to a funding
shortfall by acting on the asset side of its balance sheet to lower its financing need: in
other words, by slowing or even reducing its lending to households and corporate
customers. This policy will ease funding pressures and boost liquidity, but it has two
major drawbacks. The first is that it takes time to take effect. Many lending decisions
are agreed weeks or months in advance and cannot be readily reversed. So the
approach will not stem a very fast drainage of liquidity. Moreover, as one bank
tightens lending conditions to restrict balance sheet growth, other banks facing similar
pressure will react to limit any additional diversion of funding pressure onto their own
balance sheets. The second is that a retrenchment in lending can have significant
implications for the wider economy, as fewer funds are available to companies and
households to support long-term investment and consumption. We are seeing some
signs of that beginning to occur as highlighted in the most recent Bank of England
Credit Conditions Survey.
14 These defences suffer from a common shortcoming. While they may work well
when one bank is facing funding pressure on its own, when liquidity pressures are
widespread every bank will attempt to use them at the same time. The actions of one
bank will work to negate those of a competitor in these circumstances as gains and
losses of market share will net out. That implies an increase in the economy-wide
costs of adjustment, posing increased risks to financial stability during the adjustment
process.
15 There is, however, one last line of defence left. A bank holding a buffer of
reliable high quality liquid assets, such as Treasury bills or other government
securities, can draw on them immediately and directly in the event of a sudden
withdrawal of market liquidity or an unexpected increase in its funding requirement.
Of course, safe, liquid assets offer lower returns than other types of assets, so there is
an opportunity cost in maintaining such a liquidity cushion on the balance sheet. But

6

such assets nevertheless provide the most readily available and reliable provision
against a crystallisation of liquidity risk.
16 Unfortunately, banks’ reserves of reliable liquid assets have proved insufficient to
meet the recent funding shock. With hindsight, incentives to raise the efficiency of
maturity transformation have lowered this safety valve in the system too far.
17 I would like to examine in a little more detail the UK experience in this respect.
In the mid- nineteenth century, UK banks held on average sixty percent of liquid
assets as a proportion of total deposits, an extremely high ratio explained by the
frequency of liquidity crises around that time. Shortly after the 1866 Overend and
Gurney crisis, the Bank of England accepted a role as lender of last resort, leading
banks to relax their extremely conservative (and inefficient) approach to liquidity.
The average liquidity ratio dropped to around thirty percent of total deposits. The first
agreement on liquidity between the Bank of England and private banks occurred in
1947, and involved a requirement to hold a minimum liquid assets ratio of thirty-two
percent (lowered to twenty-eight percent sixteen years later). The regime prevailed
until 1971, when the Competition and Credit Controls Act (CCC) introduced a
minimum reserve ratio of twelve and a half percent. The CCC had two objectives:
first it was intended to strengthen control over monetary policy, by creating a solid
money base to underpin it; second, it aimed to unify restrictions on banks to
strengthen competition in the industry. The minimum reserve ratio was designed with
this aim in mind, and this perhaps took priority over any desire to impose prudential
liquidity reserves.
18 While CCC undoubtedly liberalised the UK banking sector and thus supported
improvements in competition and efficiency, it led to a fall in very high quality
sterling liquid asset holdings of UK banks, as shown in Chart 4. After twice lowering
the minimum requirement, the Bank of England finally replaced the reserve ratio
regime with the cash ratio deposit regime in 1981, which did not directly require a
minimum level of liquid assets. The Sterling Stock Liquidity Regime (SLR) in 1996
focused on holding sufficient liquidity to meet a particular severe cash flow funding
stress. It is calibrated to ensure that a bank has enough highly liquid assets to meet its
outflows for the first week of a liquidity crisis without recourse to the market for

7

renewed wholesale funding, in order to allow the authorities time to explore options
for an orderly resolution. It was designed as one component of a wider crisis
management regime, and not as a means for a bank to manage its precautionary buffer
for addressing liquidity strain on a going concern basis4.
19 Chart 4 shows how actual liquid reserves fell in line with minimum requirement
levels until 1981, and continued to decline afterwards, albeit more slowly. Clearly,
over this same period, banks also diversified their liquid asset holdings to include
other currencies, and started using repo markets extensively. So the chart may
exaggerate the decline somewhat. Nonetheless, the overall historical pattern has
clearly been one of a marked secular decline in cushions of high quality liquid assets.
Similar trends also prevailed in countries other than the UK, such as the US, Canada
and Sweden.5 And focusing on the past decade, whilst holdings of very high quality
liquid assets have remained relatively stable, they have not increased to match banks’
rising vulnerability to liquidity risk described above.
Section IV: Lessons
20 The recent turmoil has highlighted clear deficiencies in banks’ liquidity risk
management. And it has also demonstrated that these deficiencies pose serious risks to
financial stability and thus to the economy more broadly.
21 To address this risk in the near term, central banks globally have provided
additional liquidity to the banking system and emergency operations have been
conducted to support Northern Rock and Bear Stearns. Additional liquidity has been
provided at longer-term maturities to address the problem of funding an unexpected
overhang of illiquid assets. The Bank’s recently launched Special Liquidity Scheme
is enabling UK banks to liquefy a proportion of their outstanding stock of illiquid
assets by swapping them for high quality liquid government securities, while ensuring
that credit risks remain very clearly with the banks. That should ease current funding
pressures.

22 But in the medium term, it is clear that action is needed to strengthen the financial
system’s defences to liquidity risk to limit the likelihood of any recurrence of the
recent problems. Central banks globally are reviewing the lessons of the episode for
their market operations, for example, to ensure that the usefulness of facilities is not
undermined by perceptions of stigma that may be attached to a bank that uses them.
But it is clear that primary responsibility for bolstering the defences lies with the
banks themselves and that supervisory regimes for liquidity risk need reinforcing to
support that process.
23 I would like to highlight four emerging lessons from the current crisis that should
help prevent future problems. First, we need to understand better the various sources
of liquidity risk, particularly under stressed conditions. Second, banks need to
develop more effective contingency funding plans. Third, banks should support
improved market functioning and stricter market discipline through better disclosure.
And finally, supervision should ensure that banks’ liquidity risk management is
undertaken to a more robust standard, in order to internalise some of the costs of a
bank failure on the wider financial system. I shall cover these briefly in turn.
24 Banks and public authorities alike need to develop a more in-depth and more
complete understanding of the various forms in which liquidity risk can arise. That
requires both a careful analysis of the various potential sources of liquidity risk, and
of how such risks may crystallise under stressed market conditions. As outlined
earlier, in today’s financial environment, it is not just the simple maturity
transformation between deposits and loans that generates liquidity risk for banks. To
this must be added contingent risks, such as the potential activation of liquidity lines
to off-balance sheet vehicles, or the drawing of committed facilities extended to
corporate customers. Contingent risks may also arise, in a variety of forms, from
complex trading instruments, as detailed well by the Institute for International Finance
(IIF) last year.6 Yet more sources of potential funding pressure have emerged from
greater activity in capital markets, such as the pipeline risk that arises from being
unable to offload leveraged loans and warehouses of loans awaiting securitisation
when unfavourable market conditions prevail. And banks are also subject to the risk

of exposures previously passed on to third parties flowing back to them, for example
when sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities are ‘put back’ to the originator
should they be found to breach certain credit criteria. Finally, banks are also exposed
to the risks of a decline in asset market liquidity and falls in market prices through the
potential for higher collateral or margin requirements. These may substantially raise
the level of funding a bank requires on a day-to-day basis.
25 As emphasised in a recent report by the Senior Supervisors Group,7 banks need to
develop a comprehensive approach to the management of liquidity risk to ensure that
it is in line with the bank’s overall risk appetite. One strong recommendation in the
report is that financial organisations develop and apply a systematic policy of internal
charging for liquidity risk. In particular, banks need to ensure that risk decisions
made by front office traders price appropriately the liquidity risk generated by new
products and business lines, rather than treating it as a ‘free good’ or overhead to be
managed centrally by the treasury function. Furthermore, banks and supervisors
should analyse in far greater depth how the wide range of liquidity risks may
crystallise, separately or conjointly, in a stressed market environment. Rigorous stress
testing should span individual, group-wide and market-wide scenarios. There is
considerable scope for much better consideration of likely system-wide interactions,
including the potential impact of ‘crowded trades’ being unwound, the dynamics of
liquidity hoarding, and the risks of signalling weakness and thus losing market
confidence and funding lines. Stress scenarios should test properly for the outright
closure of funding markets, and explore the possibility of several markets being shut
concurrently. Finally, testing should consider longer horizons, to cater for the
possibility that a liquidity crisis could persist for some time. These are just some of
the areas which could be considered in more detail – clearly banks, supervisors and
central banks all have much to learn with regards to the design of appropriately
demanding and comprehensive stress scenarios.
26 Recent events have also highlighted the need to devise considerably tougher
contingency plans. Closer integration with stress tests will help firms develop more
reliable and robust responses to future episodes of strain. Experience has highlighted
7

Turbulence” March 2008.

10

the need to improve resilience to a sharp decline in market liquidity and to
demonstrate that firms can survive the closure of one or more funding markets by
ensuring that finance can be readily raised from a variety of sources. Consideration
should clearly be given to boosting holdings of very high quality liquid assets that can
provide reliable reserves under all conditions. And it is important that plans are
legally robust and that they are regularly tested.
27 Another lesson from the recent episode is that disclosure practices in relation to
liquidity risk management objectives, controls and metrics vary significantly. In some
cases banks go as far as providing information on stress tests and contingency funding
plans; in others there is a relative paucity of information. That hampers market
functioning: in times of heightened uncertainty a lack of information can lead to
defensive reactions by market counterparties that provision of additional information
could prevent. There are some risks from greater disclosure. For example, a bank
revealing a weak funding position could precipitate an adverse reaction, although that
should of course lead to stronger risk management as a precaution against that risk.
There are also measurement challenges. It is difficult to present a simple,
representative summary measure of liquidity risks run by a given bank – any single
definition of such a complex array of risks will necessarily be approximate. But that
does not seem a sufficient reason not to disclose any measure – indeed there may be
some parallels with market risk where a single metric such as a firm’s overall
value-at-risk is not viewed as encapsulating all dimensions of such risk. Nonetheless,
the degree of disclosure on market risks which banks are now providing under Pillar 3
of the Basel II Accord marks a definite improvement in this area. While liquidity risk
metrics remain complex and challenging, I believe that there is scope over time to
achieve some degree of enhanced, consistent disclosure across institutions.
28 The final lesson is the need for stronger oversight of banks’ liquidity risk
management practices. The authorities’ role is to preserve financial stability by
lowering the probability and impact of bank failures that could threaten the
functioning of the financial system more broadly through contagion, spillover and
damage to financial networks. There is no incentive for private banks to bear this cost
spontaneously, as their responsibility is to their shareholders rather than to users of the
financial system more broadly. The objective of prudential supervision is to correct
11

this misalignment between private incentives and public policy goals, by forcing
banks to deliver higher standards of liquidity risk management and to build stronger
defences than they would naturally provide of their own volition.
29 That leaves open the formidably difficult question of the level of resilience to
liquidity stress that the authorities should seek from individual banks. An answer to
this question requires a balance to be struck between the risks to financial stability if
resilience is set too low, and the risks of inefficiency of financial intermediation if
buffers are set too high. Moreover, in addressing this question the authorities also
need to take into account that some actions taken today to limit the likelihood and
costs of financial instability if risks do crystallise may lead agents to underinsure
again future risks. They may thus raise the probability and amplitude of future
problems.
30 Resolving these issues raises major challenges for the global regulatory
community given the strong increase in financial market integration and the
substantial growth in internationally active banks. Action is underway
internationally8 as well as domestically9 to improve and strengthen the management
and supervision of liquidity risk and to promote greater consistency of approach. The
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is working on producing revised Sound
Practices for the management and supervision of liquidity risk. These will be released
for consultation in the early summer. The Committee of European Bank Supervisors
is undertaking work in parallel. The aim is to strengthen the platform for the
management and oversight of liquidity risk. Among other areas for improvement,
supervisors are driving higher standards for stress testing and subjecting contingency
funding plans to more rigorous cross-examination before they are validated.
V Conclusion
31 To conclude, developments in financial markets have increased the importance
and complexity of liquidity risk management over the past decade. That, in turn,

increased the vulnerability of banks to a system-wide liquidity shock. Preparations
for such a shock proved inadequate and insufficient. But the recent experience
already provides us with important lessons both for banks and for public authorities
and points to a clear need for action by both.
