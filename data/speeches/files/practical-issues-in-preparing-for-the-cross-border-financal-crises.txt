PRACTICAL ISSUES IN PREPARING FOR CROSS-BORDER FINANCIAL CRISES
Introduction
My subject this evening is the challenge that globalisation poses for handling and resolving
financial crises.
If that seems a typically gloomy subject for a meeting of central banks, regulators and finance
ministries, I would like to start by emphasising two points. First, I do not believe that globalisation
is a source of instability; indeed in financial as in other markets, the opening up of international
competition has been a huge force for good; by spreading and diversifying risk, it has in many ways
made financial markets more efficient and stable. However, the fact is that governments,
regulators and central banks remain largely national and our machinery for cooperation has not kept
pace with the internationalisation of markets.
Second, I have not chosen the subject because I believe a crisis is imminent. Indeed, in the UK and
elsewhere economic and financial conditions currently are mostly benign and are forecast to remain
so. Of course concerns about global imbalances and the search for yield in financial markets remain
but our central projections like those of the IMF and most other international forecasters show the
‘Great Stability’ of the last 10 years continuing at least in the near term. But remote events do
happen – and by their nature we cannot always see them coming. Researchers at the World Bank
have recorded 13 borderline or full-blown financial crises since the late 1970s, involving at least
one Financial Stability Forum (FSF) member country.1 And there are well known incidents not on
the list: including the 1987 crash, the less developed countries’ debt crisis and LTCM’s near
collapse.
So we are fortunate in having a time of relative calm to work out together how we should react
when a problem does arise. And we have in the FSF a body that was established “to co-ordinate the
efforts of …various bodies in order to promote international financial stability, improve the
functioning of markets, and reduce systemic risk”2. In its first 7 years, much of the FSF’s focus has
been on the identification and assessment of risks in a rapidly changing financial system; it has

played a valuable role in building a common understanding among authorities and among market
participants of what the risks are and how they can be reduced. However, that level of progress has
been less apparent on putting in place arrangements for handling and resolving cross-border crises.
During that period a number of countries, including the UK, have improved their processes for
handling financial crises – including for crises sparked by business continuity events. And there
have been a number of exercises and co-ordination initiatives in different regional groups (for
example amongst the Nordic countries, Dutch and Belgian authorities, and more widely across the
EU). But there has been less progress on the wider international front. Overall, I do not know
anyone who believes that we have established either the common approach to crises or the practical
machinery which would enable us to handle a complex cross-border failure with confidence.
I would like to make some suggestions tonight on how we might take matters forward.
When and how should the State intervene to prevent or manage a financial crisis?
Of course the underlying questions are very difficult even for one country. Financial markets are
often volatile and they can only work well if investors and firms expect to live or die by their own
decisions and do not come to rely on a safety net to mitigate their losses. To avoid that ‘moral
hazard’, authorities have tended to be reluctant to spell out in what circumstances and what ways
they would be willing to help support a market or a participant, beyond making clear that it would
only be in exceptional circumstances and where it was essential in the wider systemic interest. But
the difficulty in spelling out underlying reasons must not become an excuse for lack of analysis and
preparation. In order to make cross-border crisis management work, we may have to consider
sacrificing some mystery – even if only amongst ourselves – for greater effectiveness.
The most recent cases of official emergency liquidity support to UK banks occurred in the early
1990s, when the Bank lent to a few small banks in order to prevent wider loss of confidence in the
banking system. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Treasury, FSA and Bank
which sets out our current roles in maintaining financial stability makes clear that decisions on
support operations now rest with the Chancellor, acting in the light of advice from both the Bank
and the FSA.

Following the early 1990s experiences, Eddie – now Lord George – discussed various options for
intervention.3 He argued that, in deciding whether to provide support, the authorities should:
explore every option for a commercial solution before committing public funds; structure any
support such that losses would fall first to shareholders and any benefits fall first to the authorities;
not, in normal circumstances, lend to a firm known at the time to be insolvent; and, look for a clear
exit from provision of the lending.
These guidelines go more to the question ‘how’ rather than the question ‘when’ the authorities
should intervene, and they were drawn up before the globalisation of banking and capital markets
had got fully underway. So I do not put them forward as the complete answer; rather I think we
should be discussing whether there are some common understandings which could inform and
shape cross-border cooperation.
International complexity
Of course reaching a common view will be difficult. But it seems to me a necessary step towards
meeting the challenges of handling financial instability in the new world of open international
capital markets and giant complex financial institutions.
Many of the challenges have been discussed in the international community. In particular: the
potential difficulty in amassing a complete picture of the health of firms and capital markets in
crisis from different authorities; the potential complexity of large firm structures, where entities
within a firm may be subject to different legal arrangements, preference rules and rules concerning
ownership interests and creditor arrangements; and the possible technical difficulties in winding
down an entity that is engaged in complex trading strategies. There are also of course issues around
how liquidity and capital can be moved around a group: whether collateral, funding or capital can
be moved quickly across borders to where it needs to be.
Further, some of the commonly preferred methods for resolving a financial crisis, before moving to
winding down methods, may be less easy to deploy than they were even a few years ago. I think
many of us would share Eddie George’s view that we should look first for a private sector solution
before committing public money to a rescue operation. When LTCM got into serious difficulties in
1998, and there was a risk that its liquidation could further destabilise markets, the New York
Federal Reserve was able to facilitate discussions that resulted in a cooperative market solution.

But would this kind of approach still be possible today? Certainly private sector solutions looked
easier when lending was the predominant source of funds, banking systems were arranged
predominantly along national lines, and it was possible to get the key counterparties round a single
table. Will firms that have actively engaged in methods to lay off risk when a problem occurs –
through, for example, credit derivatives and collateralisation – be as ready to contribute to solutions
predicated on the give and take of long-term relationships? And will the increasing complexity and
size of large complex financial institutions deter previously willing possible participants?
Since the FSF’s creation, there has been further consolidation of international banking groups and
globalisation of markets. Our vulnerabilities are more concentrated: although the firms and capital
markets in which they are concentrated are probably more resilient, we have bigger and potentially
more complex points of failure. This concentration has brought efficiencies, and has been
supported by enhanced oversight of global firms and the capital markets they operate in. But the
price we pay is more complicated (and therefore potentially more costly) crisis resolution.
A practical way forward
So how can we make more progress? I have spoken about drawing up a shared framework or set of
principles but I am only too aware how easily that could become a drafting exercise in which
difficult issues are evaded rather than dealt with.
Clearly initiatives such as this workshop are a useful way to bring relevant policymakers together –
and I am encouraged by the shared commitment to make progress that you have shown by being
here today.
My suggestion is that probably the best way of making further progress on a genuine and useful
common approach is to work together on practical examples; to consider some of the operational
problems that we would face if particular sorts of crises arose. And thus establish a shared fact base
and understanding of what we might expect from each other in a crisis, and how we should go about
handling it.
This idea of informal groups of relevant authorities is not new. In a sense, it is borrowed from the
supervisory world, where colleges of regulators have existed for some time, with the aim of
devising ways of pooling knowledge and developing common approaches – to supervise firms
efficiently and to reduce the supervisory burden for them.

6
The groups to discuss crisis management issues would need to bring together supervisors and
central banks. Both are likely to have day to day information which is relevant in a crisis, and both
will also have control of tools which can be used to handle the problem. At the same time, the
number of participants would probably need to be smaller than in a regulatory college if these group
are to be effective. To remain focused, the core group might perhaps need to be limited to
authorities from two or three countries each, rather than wider groups.
And selectivity, flexibility and pragmatism would be absolutely key. I am not advocating, for
example, that we form a group for every firm that includes all authorities in every jurisdiction
where that firm has a presence. Instead, that we use a risk-based approach to concentrate on those
authorities with a mutual interest, identify the specific firms and capital markets that that mutual
interest might cover, and bring together those relevant authorities to discuss those firms and the
capital markets they interact in. Indeed, some countries’ authorities have already met bilaterally or
in small groups to discuss crisis management topics of particular mutual interest.
There are a number of practical aspects of crisis management that these interest groups could
enhance. First, co-ordination in a crisis. This, alongside information-sharing, is the area that has
received most generic attention at the cross-border level. Our challenge is to embed processes that
will be relevant for crises into our everyday interactions: co-ordination is likely to be much easier
amongst colleagues who are already familiar with each other and with each other’s views and
approach, than with someone who is simply a name on a contact list. This is one positive feature of
discussing these issues, just as some of the value of MoUs lies in the process of negotiation and the
relationships that fosters.
Second: information-sharing in a crisis. Interest groups would be a good forum to discuss in
advance what information it might be appropriate to share on specific firms, and to ensure that it
would in practice be readily available. And in doing so, we will better understand the information
and therefore be able to assess it more quickly and more confidently in-crisis.
Third: in-crisis systemic impact assessment. A key first step in deciding how to handle a crisis is in
understanding the likely cost of not intervening in it – the likely systemic impact of it. The impact
of a particular problem or failure of a particular firm will of course depend on the characteristics of
that specific problem – and importantly on the resilience of the financial system, and the
interlinkages amongst different elements of it at the time. However, there are common channels
through which shocks propagate. And some of those channels will be more relevant for particular
firms than others. The important aspect of developing this work is in providing a common

7
vocabulary in which policymakers can discuss the possible impact of a problem. This may also
help to provide a framework for deciding whether to intervene in a crisis, as well as helping to
understand who may be interested in intervening.
And fourth: the types of measures we have available in a crisis. I outlined earlier a number of
challenges in resolving a crisis involving a large complex financial institution, and the obstacles we
may face in addressing them. The Contact Group 2002 report on legal underpinnings4 provided
more detail on the extent to which different legal regimes created vulnerabilities in managing crises.
Through discussion of hypothetical problems for real firms we may get closer to understanding
more concretely what these obstacles will look like in practice and therefore what we might want to
put in place to mitigate them. Put another way, it is potentially a way to develop practical solutions,
or at least a practical understanding of the specific issues we might face, within the parameters of
our current legal and fiscal set up.
What we learn from firm-focussed interest groups should also put us in a better position to tackle
some of the thorny issues we face. One which particularly exercises me is ensuring that we should
always have the option of closing down a large firm in an orderly way, even if we need to use
emergency liquidity assistance as a bridging loan to do so (rather than as a step towards keeping the
firm open).
Looking further ahead, it is clear that these interest groups should not remain inward-looking. In
order for any preparations for crisis to be relevant, authorities will need to ensure that they are
informed by firms’ plans and views – for example on their likely own actions in crisis, where they
see their vulnerabilities in managing a problem, what they expect the authorities to do, and where
arrangements could be improved. So the ongoing dialogue that the relevant authorities have with
firms may well inform, and be informed by, the work of interest groups.
What role could the FSF play in promoting these kinds of bilateral or small multilateral discussions
and exercises on practical topics regarding specific firms and markets? As we all know, it is not the
role of the FSF to manage cross-border crises. But my view is that the FSF does have a role in this
area. To me it seems the ideal group to draw out the common messages and lessons that may
emerge from these interest group discussions, and to establish a common framework for handling
crises which will be of use both to its members and more widely.
