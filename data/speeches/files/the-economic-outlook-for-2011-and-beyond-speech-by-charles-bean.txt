The Economic Outlook for 2011 and Beyond

Speech by Charles Bean
Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy
Bank of England

At the Market News International Annual Seminar, London
13 December 2010

Good morning! Christmas is the traditional time for looking back over the events of the past year
and contemplating what the new year might bring. Today I shall follow that tradition by taking
stock of economic developments over the past year and looking at the challenges ahead.

Many of the recent activity indicators have been somewhat comforting. Global growth has
recovered strongly on the back of a strong rebound in the emerging economies, with the IMF
projecting expansion of close to 5% this year and more than 4% next year. Here in the United
Kingdom, we have also seen a nascent recovery; output in the third quarter was, according to the
latest ONS estimates, some 2.8% higher than a year earlier. That is marginally stronger than our
projection for the most-likely path of four-quarter growth made a year earlier in our August 2009
Inflation Report.

Around half of the growth over the past year was, however, down to the contribution of
stockbuilding, as businesses reduced the rate of inventory decumulation and, in some cases,
started to rebuild stocks. That can only provide a temporary boost to aggregate demand growth.
And the contribution of public spending to growth is also set to fall as the Government’s planned
fiscal consolidation gets underway. So economic prospects depend crucially on private final
domestic demand and net exports picking up the baton; fortunately there have been signs that
handover might be starting to take place in the latest quarterly data.

Private final domestic demand fell sharply in the recession. Consumer spending decreased by
more than 4% over the five quarters from 2008Q2, as the prospect of reduced real incomes led
households to cut their borrowing and build up precautionary savings balances. During this
period, the household savings rate rose by almost six percentage points. Since then, we have seen
a modest recovery in consumer spending, and measures such as the CBI Distributive Trades
Survey suggest that recovery is likely to have continued into the final quarter of this year.

The prospects for household spending through next year and beyond depend crucially on
households’ expectations of their future incomes, as well as their balance sheet positions.
Consumer confidence measures have generally weakened through this year, possibly reflecting
concerns about the prospective fiscal consolidation. An open question is how far the impact of
that consolidation has already been taken on board by households in their spending decisions, and
how much adjustment is yet to come. The annual survey of households’ financial positions

2

carried out for the Bank by NMG Consulting 1 included some special questions on this topic and
found that, while the majority of households expected to be affected in some way, less than half
had so far responded by spending less, working longer hours or looking for a new job. That
suggests there may be further adjustment to come.

Investment fell even more sharply than private consumption during the recession – down almost
20% – as the higher cost and reduced availability of finance, coupled with sharply heightened
uncertainty about economic prospects, led businesses to cancel or postpone investment projects.
While the outlook remains highly uncertain, the improvement in both financial markets and in the
real economy since mid-2009 is likely to have contributed to the modest recovery seen in
businesses’ capital spending over the past year. And though continued tight credit conditions may
restrain the investment spending of small and medium-sized enterprises, the bulk of capital
expenditure is carried out by large businesses. They appear to be less credit-constrained and also
have better access to the capital markets. Moreover, despite the downturn, the corporate financial
position appears to be relatively healthy. So the availability of finance is unlikely to be a major
brake. Rather investment spending is likely to be restrained by the juxtaposition of muted product
demand and an overhang of spare capacity.

For almost as long as I have been a member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, we have
pointed to the need for a re-balancing of the composition of demand at some juncture, away from
domestic demand and towards net exports. Accompanying that re-balancing would be a reorientation of the structure of activity away from businesses that predominantly meet domestic
needs towards those producing internationally tradable goods and services. The substantial
depreciation of sterling – down around a quarter since August 2007 – should facilitate that rebalancing by making it more profitable to produce for export or to compete against imports. For
example, relative unit labour costs in the United Kingdom are now more than 25% lower than
before the crisis.

The contribution of net exports to the recovery had – at least until the very latest GDP release –
been somewhat disappointing. Net exports reduced growth by a total of 0.7 percentage points
over the past four quarters, as import growth outstripped that of exports. As world output,
weighted according to countries’ importance to UK trade, grew somewhat faster over that period
than UK activity, the weakness in the UK’s net export performance cannot be attributed to a more
rapid recovery here. Some of the weakness can perhaps be ascribed to strong import growth

Nielsen, Silvia Pezzini, Kate Reinold and Richard Williams, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Winter 2010.

associated with the working out of the stock cycle, as inventories are relatively import intensive.
But closer investigation suggests that the weakness has been especially concentrated in exports of
financial services, no doubt in part reflecting the impact of the banking crisis. Foreigners’
demand for UK financial services may plausibly continue to be somewhat lower than before the
crisis, so this weakness may persist.

In contrast, there are signs that the depreciation in sterling is having the expected effect on the
market share of goods exporters. That is also reflected in the robust growth in manufacturing
output and in business surveys which report buoyant export orders. So far, there is less sign that
the lower level of sterling is leading to the substitution of imports by domestically produced
goods and services. But it is likely that the producers of internationally tradable goods and
services take time to respond to the improved opportunities associated with a lower real exchange
rate, especially if investment in foreign distribution networks or the repatriation of off-shored
activities is required. So, other things equal, it seems reasonable to expect the impact of the lower
level of sterling on net exports to continue to build through next year.

The prospects for net exports obviously depend not only on the response to the past depreciation
of sterling, but also on demand in the UK’s main export markets. While global growth has been
strong over the past year, much of that has been in emerging economies that presently account for
a relatively small proportion of UK exports.

Growth has been patchier in the developed economies. In the United States, following a series of
soft indicators through the late summer and early autumn, the US Federal Reserve announced
additional purchases of US treasuries. And the Obama administration is seeking to inject a
further fiscal stimulus, incorporating not only the widely expected extension of the Bush
administration tax cuts, but also a temporary cut in payroll taxes. The extension of the Federal
Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programme has proved controversial, with some US critics
asserting that it is inflationary and policymakers in some of the emerging economies claiming that
it is both an attempt to engineer a beggar-my-neighbour devaluation and that it will boost capital
inflows and foster asset-price bubbles.

These criticisms seem to me mostly off the mark. Central banks undertake asset purchases
financed by the issuance of central bank money in order to boost nominal spending. They do that
by depressing a range of longer-term real yields and raising asset prices. The earlier phases of
quantitative easing both here and in the United States indeed appear to have lowered longer-term
4

nominal and real yields below where they would otherwise have been 2. This time around, the
transmission channel has been rather different, as after falling on the anticipation of further asset
purchases, longer-term US yields rose. But the policy should only prove inflationary in the
medium to long run if it results in excessive nominal spending growth, which hardly appears
likely at the current juncture. Only if the Federal Reserve fails to tighten policy promptly as the
recovery takes hold is excessive inflation likely to be a problem.

The criticisms from outside seem to me almost as misplaced. While quantitative easing is likely
to be associated with exchange rate depreciation, it also boosts domestic spending. Demand in
other countries therefore rises as a result of the increased demand in the United States, as well as
falling as a result of the appreciation of their currencies. These are just the normal mechanisms
that operate when official interest rates are cut in one country. It is then an empirical matter
which is the dominant channel. Quantitative easing is consequently very different in character
from sterilised exchange rate intervention, which merely redistributes global demand.

There is, though, more substance to the concern that stimulatory monetary policies in the
developed economies have encouraged a search for yield and capital inflows into the emerging
economies. So there is some justification for the imposition of temporary restraints on those
inflows. But where such asset price pressures are building, they seem more likely to be related to
overly loose monetary and financial policies in those countries and their unwillingness to allow
exchange rates to bear more of the strain.

It is the euro area, however, that is of particular importance to the United Kingdom. In aggregate,
the euro area looks to be undergoing a steady recovery, not dissimilar to ours. Output in the third
quarter was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, roughly in line with the euro area’s historical average
growth rate. But that masks markedly divergent performance and prospects within the euro area.
Germany is growing rapidly, led in part by an expansion in exports to the booming Asian
economies. The countries of the periphery are, however, struggling in the face of significant
fiscal and structural challenges. While the countries of the euro-area periphery are each
confronted by specific challenges, they all need to restore their competitiveness without the
option of devaluation. Instead, in the absence of effective structural reform, they face the
2

Analysis of the earlier phases of quantitative easing both here and in the United States suggest that purchases of the
order of 12-14% of GDP have lowered longer-term government and corporate bond yields by around 70-100 basis
points relative to where they would otherwise have been. See Michael Joyce, Ana Lasaosa, Ibrahim Stevens and
Matthew Tong, “The Financial Market Impact of Quantitative Easing,” Bank of England Working Paper No.393,
2010, and Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack, “Large-scale Asset Purchases by the
Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report No.441, 2010.

prospect of sustained low growth in order to drive down wages and prices. That itself makes the
task of stabilising public debt harder.

Support to Greece and Ireland from the IMF and rest of the European Union has given those
countries a breathing space in which to undertake the necessary adjustments. Financial support
for other countries may or may not prove necessary – only time will tell. But the important thing
for us is whether an intensification of the difficulties in the euro-area periphery could also derail
the recovery here.

Sharp fiscal consolidation and very slow growth in the periphery countries would, of course, have
some adverse impact on the demand for our exports. But the more significant links are potentially
through the financial system. Fortunately, UK banks have done much to improve their resilience
over the past couple of years and, even under a very adverse scenario, they should be able to
absorb the likely losses on their direct exposures to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain without
too much difficulty. There is, though, the possibility of further indirect effects arising through the
interconnectedness and cross-border operations of European banks which could amplify the
impact. So some adverse effect on the funding costs of UK banks and the supply of credit
remains a possibility.

Harder to gauge is the potential effect on household and, especially, business confidence. In the
aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, this was arguably the most significant transmission
channel to the real economy. An intensification of the sovereign debt problems in the euro area
could therefore administer a blow to the recovery here. But given the very high degree of
uncertainty, there is little that the MPC can do to deal with this risk ahead of crystallisation.

While UK output growth has come in much in line with our expectations, the same cannot be said
of our primary objective, inflation. Back in August of last year, our central projection was for
CPI inflation to be around 1.5% now. But inflation has been markedly stronger than that – 3.2%
on the latest reading. Why has inflation been so much higher, especially given that our
expectations for growth have largely been fulfilled? There are three factors that account for this 3.

First, energy and non-oil commodity prices are substantially higher than in the summer of 2009.
By convention, we base our forecasts for these variables on futures prices, which were relatively
flat at that time. The buoyancy of commodity prices since then reflects the rebound in global

activity, and especially the strength in the emerging economies. In addition, temporary supply
factors have boosted the prices of some agricultural commodities. At present there appears to be
a margin of spare capacity in the oil market, so that may permit global growth to remain strong
without putting further upward pressure on energy prices immediately. But a low elasticity of
supply of other commodities means that their prices, relative to those of finished goods and
services, may continue to drift upwards. That would constitute an additional headwind for the
United Kingdom.

A second factor behind the unexpectedly high inflation appears to have been greater than
expected pass-through into final prices from the depreciation of sterling after August 2007.
Evidence from the United Kingdom and other countries during the Great Moderation suggested
that pass-through had fallen, perhaps because inflation expectations were better anchored. We
expected something similar on this occasion too. In the event, the strength of UK goods inflation,
relative to that in the other G7 economies, suggests that the pass-through of the depreciation was
in fact rather greater, and similar to that before the Great Moderation.

The third potential ingredient behind higher inflation is a more moderate drag from the margin of
spare capacity in the economy. Pay growth has been subdued during the recession, and that has
helped to ensure that unemployment has risen far less than many commentators feared. Rather
the puzzle is on the pricing side, as prices have been higher relative to costs than expected.

That could indicate that the margin of spare capacity is not as large as the collapse in activity
might suggest. On current estimates, output is presently about 10% below a continuation of its
pre-crisis trend. But historical experience indicates that the output losses – relative to the precrisis trend – after banking crises tend to be highly persistent. That suggests that such crises are
associated with an impairment of supply capacity too. Business surveys are consistent with this,
implying that the margin of spare capacity in firms is now relatively limited – in fact not much
larger than after the bursting of the dotcom bubble. But against that, it is difficult to find any
direct evidence of supply impairment. For instance, liquidations have been running at less than
1% (compared to 3% in the 1990s recession). One resolution of the puzzle may be that producers
have mothballed capacity, which could, at a cost, be brought into use if demand conditions
warranted.

The MPC’s view is that the current elevated level of inflation is likely to persist in the near term –
indeed our central expectation for inflation is somewhat higher than that of outside commentators.
7

Ultimately, however, this period of elevated inflation should prove temporary. The standard rate
of VAT is set to rise again at the beginning of next year, but once that drops out of the annual
comparison a year later, so the inflation rate is likely to fall back sharply. The impact on prices of
sterling’s past depreciation should be starting to wane. And the relatively moderate expansion
that we expect over the next year or two should ensure that there is some, albeit uncertain, brake
on inflation from spare capacity. We have seen muted underlying inflation pressures in both the
euro area and the United States, reflecting the spare capacity in those economies, and there is no
reason to believe that the United Kingdom will behave differently once the temporary influences
subside.

But there are risks to this scenario. They are twofold. First, that strong global growth continues
to generate upward pressure on the prices of commodities and tradable goods more generally.
And, second, that the period of elevated inflation causes medium-term inflation expectations to
drift up, leading to higher rates of increase of both wages and prices. Measures of near-term
household inflations have moved up in line with the MPC’s own assessment of near-term
inflation, but the rise in longer-term measures has been considerably more muted. And measures
derived from inflation swaps suggest that the expectations of financial market participants five
years ahead have remained stable. But given the unexpected strength of inflation in recent
months, this risk has probably increased of late. So we shall be watching these indicators, and
their impact on wages and prices, like proverbial hawks.

What are the implications of all this for monetary policy? The recovery has so far turned out to
be broadly in line with that expected a year ago, but the outlook for growth remains highly
uncertain. Though inflation has been running well above target and is likely to continue to do so
for a while yet, beyond the end of next year it should fall back to near the Committee’s 2% target.
In the light of that outlook, I believe we have made appropriate use of the “constrained discretion”
granted to us in the Chancellor’s remit, looking through the temporarily elevated inflation to the
medium term in order to avoid unnecessary volatility in output. Tightening policy sharply in
order to deal with the currently elevated level of inflation would simply have put a brake on the
recovery unnecessarily and would have made inflation more likely than not to fall below the
target in the medium term.

If all goes to plan, however, and private final demand continues to pick up the baton as the fiscal
consolidation proceeds, then the margin of spare capacity will shrink and it will at some juncture

8

become appropriate to begin withdrawing the current extraordinary degree of monetary stimulus.
And, when that point comes, the MPC will aim to do so in a timely, but measured, fashion.

As 2010 draws to a close, the good news, then, is that the recovery, here and more widely, has
remained on track, following the sharpest downturn in activity since the Great Depression. Such
an outcome was by no means guaranteed twelve months ago; for that we must be grateful. But
there remain significant challenges for the year ahead. In many developed countries, the aftereffects of the financial crisis still linger, in the form of banks that are still overly reliant on official
support, fragile household and business confidence, and bloated public sector deficits and debt.
Moreover, the rapid recovery in emerging markets has reawakened global inflationary pressures.
And here in the United Kingdom, inflation has been running above the MPC’s 2% target for an
uncomfortably long time.

It may be some while yet before normality is restored. Thank you.
