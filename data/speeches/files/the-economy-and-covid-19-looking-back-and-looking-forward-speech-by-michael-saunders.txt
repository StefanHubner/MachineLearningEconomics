In this speech, I want to look back over some of the economic developments during this year, and to look
forward to the prospects for the next year or two.

Looking back, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the measures designed to tackle it, have had dramatic effects on
economic activity in recent months. As Covid-19 spread early this year, increased social distancing, higher
uncertainty and the lockdown caused activity to weaken very sharply in March and April. Since then, as the
lockdown has eased, the rebound in activity appears to have been a bit faster than the scenario in the
May MPR. Even so, GDP fell by about 22% over Q1 and Q2 combined, the biggest two quarter decline on
record.1

By contrast, the LFS data suggest that employment and unemployment have been relatively stable over that
period. The jobless rate remained close to a record low in Q2, while the share of the adult population in work
apparently remains around a record high. In an even bigger contrast, broad money growth (M4) has been
exceptionally strong, rising from below 5% YoY in February to 12.4% YoY in July – the highest since 1990.2
This mix is very different to prior recessions, which generally saw money, jobs and GDP weaken together.

In this speech, I want to make four main points:

1

There is always some uncertainty about GDP measurement, and recent data may well be revised over time. But, with marked
weakness in business surveys and timely indicators of economic activity, there is no reason to doubt the key point that activity has fallen
very sharply over the last two quarters.
2
M4 is defined as the holdings by the private sector excluding monetary financial institutions (MFIs) of notes and coin, sterling deposits
including CDs, as well as commercial paper, bonds, FRNs and other instruments up to five years original maturity issued by UK MFIs.
Sterling deposits account for the vast bulk of this. Data refer to M4 excluding deposits held by non-bank financial intermediate
companies since 1998, overall M4 before 1998. The recent growth rates are similar for overall M4.



The economy’s faster-than-expected rebound in the last few months has reflected a benign window
in which large fiscal support has coincided with the relaxation of lockdown measures and low
infection rates. This window may now be closing.



Unemployment is likely to rise significantly in coming quarters as the furlough scheme winds down
and workforce participation recovers.



The strength in money growth is an indication of the exceptional level of fiscal and monetary policy
support in recent months. It is unlikely to translate into excess spending given the economic impact
from Covid-19.



Looking forward, I suspect that risks lie on the side of a slower recovery over the next year or two
and a longer period of excess supply than the forecast in the August MPR. If these risks develop,
then some further monetary loosening may be needed in order to support the economy and prevent
a persistent undershoot of the 2% inflation target.

***
Let’s start with the economy’s recent performance. The available evidence suggests that GDP fell a bit
less than expected in April as the full effects of the lockdown came through, and has recovered faster than
the May scenario since then.

I would be cautious about extrapolating much from this apparent outperformance. The uncertainty around
the May MPR scenario was particularly high, given the limited information available at that stage on the
extent of the decline in activity during the lockdown. In the May MPR, the MPC did not publish the usual fan
charts around our GDP profile, because we judged there was no reliable way to estimate the uncertainty
around the central path. The preliminary Q2 GDP data were well within my personal estimate of the margins
of error around our published scenario. In addition, some areas of consumption were less constrained than
expected during the lockdown, with a marked shift to online sales and some substitution among particular
areas of spending (eg a shift from eating in restaurants to takeaways). And the lockdown eased earlier than
anticipated, advancing some of the expected consumer rebound.
I also suspect that government support measures – for example the JRS, increased benefits, tax payment
deferrals, mortgage holidays and so forth – turned out to be more powerful than expected in supporting
household incomes and spending. This partly reflects a greater-than-expected impact from measures
announced before the May MPR, and partly reflects measures (including extra spending) announced after
the May MPR was finalised.3

The OBR’s estimate of the scale of the fiscal support measures in 20/21 introduced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has risen
from £123.2bn on 14 May (just after the May MPR was published) to £192.3bn on 14 July. This includes measures in the July Summer
Economic Update, some of which had already taken effect before that Update.

The OBR estimates that extraordinary fiscal support measures announced so far in response to the Covid
crisis total about £192bn in the current fiscal year, equal to roughly 9% of annual GDP. These measures are
heavily front-loaded in their impact. More than half (£108bn) was concentrated in the April-June quarter,
equal to 19% of last year’s average quarterly GDP.4 Fiscal support has been smaller in the third quarter, and
diminishes during the quarter. Even so, it is still worth about £54bn for Q3 as a whole, (equal to 10% of last
year’s quarterly GDP), including significant deferrals of tax payments for people subject to self-assessment.

So far, that fiscal support has, to a considerable extent, shielded aggregate household incomes from the
decline in activity. For example, official figures suggest that the direct effect of government support measures
added roughly 20% to the average incomes of working households in May.5 To be sure, there is
considerable variation among households, and some have felt a sizeable squeeze in incomes. Nevertheless,
the August MPR projects that, in aggregate, household real post-tax labour income in Q2 and Q3 will be
significantly up from a year ago and actually will be stronger than in the January MPR forecast, before Covid
effects became significant.6 Within that, wage and salary income probably will be weaker than in the January
MPR forecast (despite the furlough scheme), but there is a modest offset from lower inflation and a large
offsetting boost from increases in welfare payments, temporary tax cuts and tax deferrals.

The OBR provide estimates for the timing of some fiscal measures. Others are the author’s estimates. The timing reflects the effects
on the fiscal deficit. The timing of the effects of these measures on economic activity may differ. These figures only include the impacts
of government lending schemes in so far as they affect the fiscal deficit. If one allows for the full cashflow effects of these lending
schemes, the figure for total support in 2020/21 would be higher, especially in the last few months. The figures are expressed as a
percentage of 2019 average quarterly GDP. The figures will be higher compared to the actual lower level of GDP this year.

See HMT (2020). The total impact of government support schemes on household incomes, including indirect effects of measures
supporting company cashflow and increased spending on goods and services, probably has been greater.
6
This is defined as wage and salary income, plus government transfers to households, less direct tax payments, and deflated by the
consumer spending deflator. Household disposable income – which is slightly broader in coverage – is more volatile, but is also
expected to be a little stronger in Q3 than the January MPR forecast.

In all, the economy in June, July and August has benefited from a relatively benign confluence of factors:
fiscal support has remained very high, the easing of lockdown has allowed more spending including pent up
demand, while the lagged effects of lockdown have kept infection rates low and reassured consumers.

However, even that very limited sweet spot may now be fading. Covid-19 infection rates in the UK and
elsewhere in Europe have been rising for several weeks. In turn, timely indicators suggest that consumer
confidence has levelled off. Moreover, the government’s current plans imply that net fiscal support measures
will fall to an average of £15bn per quarter (2-3% of GDP) in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. There are some new
stimulus measures scheduled to come through, such as the job retention bonus. However, the large support
from the JRS and SEISS will end, and tax payments deferred from Q2 and Q3 will be due. As a result, the
MPC’s forecast in the August MPR implies that, from the Q3 level, household real post-tax labour income will
fall over the next year and will stay below the Q3 level throughout the next three years.
Given this, I do not interpret the economy’s recovery in the last few months as a strong signal that further
upside surprises lie ahead. I shall discuss some risks to the outlook more fully later.

Let me turn to the jobs data.

The resilience of the LFS employment and unemployment data does not mean the recession has left the
labour market unscathed. There are more uncertainties than usual over the accuracy of the LFS data given
reduced sample sizes. But I doubt that the stability in unemployment is just due to mismeasurement. Other
LFS indicators show that the amount of paid work has weakened markedly since the start of the year.


The total level of hours worked in the economy fell by 18% QoQ in Q2 (and fell by 19% YoY),
roughly in proportion to the drop in Q2 GDP.7



The share of those in employment who report they are temporarily away from paid work soared to
25% in April and May, compared to normal levels of around 7%, and remained high, at around 23%,
in late June.



There has been a sharp rise in the number of people working fewer hours than usual, with the
overwhelming share of these citing Covid-19 as the key factor.

These measures all signal very significant weakness in the labour market. The stability of the official data on
jobs and unemployment are outliers in the general picture of severe weakness.

The key factor, again, is official support measures. The JRS has greatly limited the pressure on firms to cut
jobs. HMRC data suggest that on average 8 million jobs (27% of all employee jobs) were furloughed under
7

In the LFS, people are usually interviewed over five successive periods. First-time non-respondents are assumed to have the same
labour market status, including hours worked, as in their prior interview. Excluding this group, total hours worked fell by 28% YoY in Q2.
On both measures, the decline in hours is fairly close – given uncertainties – to what one would expect given the drop in GDP.

the JRS in Q2. The SEISS has reduced the need for self-employed workers who were unable to work as
usual to seek other forms of work, and 2.6 million self-employed workers (55% of self-employed workers,
and 8% of total employment) made claims under this scheme by end-July. Moreover, the business support
measures (eg loan schemes, tax payment deferrals) probably have also helped firms to limit job cuts.
Had these schemes not been available, it is highly likely in my view that the collapse in hours worked in Q2
would have been reflected in a sharp drop in employment.

In addition, the lockdown probably meant that more people were classed as inactive in labour market terms,
either because they were not actively looking for work or were not available to start work.8 Many jobs cannot
be done from home and some people may have been reluctant to leave home, perhaps because of health
concerns, child care responsibilities, or reluctance to use public transport. There are signs of such effects in
the LFS data. For example, there has been a sharp rise in the number of people who are classed as inactive
but say they would like to work, as well as a marked drop in workforce participation among the over 65s (who
might be most reluctant to seek work during the pandemic). There also was a very large flow of people from
unemployment to inactivity in the second quarter.

Similar factors capped unemployment in Q2 across other European economies. Many other countries had
job support schemes, of varying sizes. And countries had varying degrees of lockdown (which affected
participation). Looking across countries, the relation between the QoQ changes in GDP and unemployment
rates in Q2 looks counter-intuitively positive. Some countries with large declines in GDP (eg Ireland, France,
Spain and the UK) saw little or no rise in unemployment. Conversely, some countries (eg Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Sweden) experienced large rises in unemployment despite relatively small declines in activity.
The overall euro area jobless rate was roughly stable in Q2 (like the UK), despite a 12% drop in GDP.

In the LFS, people are counted as unemployed if they are out of work, have looked for work in the last four weeks, and are available to
start work in the next two weeks, in line with the international definition of unemployment specified by the ILO.

Forecast. The change in the unemployment rate is between June 2020 and March 2020. Sources: Eurostat, European Commission,
OECD, ONS and Bank of England.

A panel regression across European countries (see Appendix) suggests that, for a given pace of GDP
growth, unemployment tended to rise by less (or fall) in Q2 in countries with more extensive official job
support schemes (ie the furlough effect), or more stringent lockdowns (which affects participation). Allowing
for effects of job support schemes and lockdowns, the usual negative relationship between GDP growth and
unemployment re-emerges. In this context, the lack of any significant rise in UK unemployment in Q2 is not
so surprising, with the upward pressure on unemployment from the marked drop in Q2 GDP offset by the
relatively large scale of the UK official job support schemes and relatively long period of stringent lockdown.

Looking ahead, the dampening effects on unemployment in the UK from furlough and participation are likely
to diminish in coming months. With the lockdown having eased, participation is likely to recover, because
more people should be able to look for work and be available to start work, especially if schools are open as
planned. The furlough scheme will be wound down by end-October, although firms will be eligible to receive
a £1000 bonus for every furloughed employee who remains in employment until end-January.9

The share of private sector employees who are furloughed has already fallen from 30% in May to about 11%
in mid-August (according to the ONS BICS data). So far, it appears that most of those moving off furlough
have returned to work with the same firm. But it is likely that firms experiencing stronger demand will be
relatively quick to bring staff back from furlough, and that a higher share of those still furloughed are in firms

The JRS was closed to new entrants from mid-July, while employers have had to bear an increasing share of the costs of furloughed
staff since early August.

that are not currently trading or face weaker activity. This implies that, of those still on furlough, a relatively
high share may become unemployed.

As a result, unless activity and hours worked quickly recover the lost ground, unemployment is likely to rise
markedly. The news in this respect is worrying. Job vacancies are down by 55% YoY and business surveys
show marked weakness in firms’ hiring intentions. There has been a wave of redundancy announcements
over the last few months. In turn, unemployment fears are becoming more widespread, with a marked rise in
the share of people that expect unemployment to rise sharply in the year ahead.

In the August MPR, the MPC’s central forecast was that the LFS jobless rate will nearly double by yearend,
rising from 3.9% of the workforce in Q2 to 7.5% in Q4. The scale of the projected rise in unemployment
(about 3½ pp) is similar to that seen in 2008-11, but it occurs much faster. Indeed, it would be, by some
distance, the sharpest rise in unemployment for at least 50 years.10 While there are uncertainties around that
forecast, my view is that the picture of a sharp rise in unemployment is – sadly – highly plausible.

What do the money data tell us?

The surge in broad money growth is widespread, with strong gains across all the main sectors. The growth of
M4 held by private non-financial companies has picked up especially sharply, reaching 25% YoY in July
(highest since 1986) and with an annualised gain of 45% in the last three months. Broad money held by

period.

non-bank financial companies rose strongly in March but its growth has cooled a little since then. Household
M4 growth has picked up less dramatically but, at 7.7% YoY, it is the highest since 2008.

For an individual household, you could explain a rise in their M4 holdings as a side effect of higher savings.
The household saving ratio has indeed risen sharply, partly reflecting the restrictions on spending during the
lockdown and partly reflecting higher uncertainty and increased caution. But while this story of higher savings
lifting M4 growth might hold at an individual level, it is not the whole story at an aggregate level. The
spending of one household affects other people’s incomes. A marked rise in household savings tends to
result in weaker economic growth (the paradox of thrift), and this is usually reflected in lower broad money
growth (as in 1990/92 and 2008/09).

Using the standard counterparts, broad money growth is usually mainly driven by the growth of private sector
credit. At times, swings in non-deposit liabilities, or external counterparts, play a role. Public sector
transactions also can be important, especially during periods of QE.

One key difference with those previous downturns is that private credit growth has held up this year, hence
supporting broad money growth. In those previous downturns, the drop in activity was demand-driven, as
households and businesses retrenched in response to monetary tightening and over-extended balance
sheets. This was reflected in marked weakness in credit and hence also in broad money. By contrast, the
recent downturn was in part triggered by mandatory restrictions on activity. Households borrowed less, but
firms sought to borrow more to fill the gap as profits weakened, so that overall demand for credit held up.
And, thanks to the marked rise in their capital ratios during the last decade, banks have been much better
placed than previously to meet that demand for credit.

But the key factor that has allowed money growth to accelerate while the economy has shrunk has been the
extraordinary scale of monetary and fiscal stimulus during this year. As noted earlier, household incomes
have been supported by a sharp rise in government transfers, wage subsidies, and deferred tax payments.
There has been an extra cashflow benefit from deferrals of mortgage payments.11 Official lending schemes
have helped to maintain credit supply, especially for companies.12 Company cashflows have also been
supported by tax deferrals. As a result, despite lower profits, the share of companies that report they have
enough cash reserves to cover at least six months of operations is a little higher now than a few months ago.
All this has been backed up by the BoE’s asset purchase programme, which (to the extent that bonds have
been bought from the non-bank private sector) acts directly to boost broad money growth.13 With the
combination of the rising fiscal deficit and sizeable asset purchases, public sector transactions mechanically
explain most of the strength in broad money in the last couple of quarters.14

A monetarist perspective might imply that this surge in broad money growth signals the prospect of a strong
recovery in activity and possible overheating over the next couple of years. In such a view, households and
businesses aim to hold an equilibrium level of money and a substantial excess of money, if sustained, would
prompt extra spending (this could occur directly or via asset price inflation and wealth effects).

11

Finance UK report that from the number of mortgage payment holidays granted by lenders reached 1.9 million in June, 17% of the
number of outstanding mortgages. Another indication is that the average monthly level of regular repayments of mortgage debt in AprilJuly was 13% below the Q1 average.
12
In all, the BBLS, CBIL, CLBIL and CCFF schemes have provided companies with roughly £70bn of funding since mid-March.
13
These transactions are reflected most directly in a rise in deposits held by non-bank financial companies.

The public sector contribution to M4 is defined as the public sector net cash requirement less net sales of government debt to the nonbank private sector.

There is some evidence that changes in broad money affect spending.15 And the economy’s prospects are
certainly much better than if such large policy support had not been forthcoming. But I wouldn’t get too
carried away by this prospect of money-fuelled inflation pressures. In particular, I suspect that under current
conditions, households and companies will want to hold relatively high levels of liquid assets (especially
deposits), both in the nearterm and further ahead. In other words, the crisis has lifted the demand for money
– the amount of deposits that households and businesses would like to hold – as well as the rise in the
supply of money described above.16
This ‘dash for cash’ escalated rapidly during March, as evidence of rising Covid infection rates accumulated
and activity began to weaken markedly. Bank lending to non-financial companies, and M4 held by these
companies, both showed record monthly growth in March. In financial markets, strains rapidly became acute,
as the increased volatility of asset prices forced some leveraged investors to sell and prompted a widespread
dash into bank deposits.17

Financial market strains have eased considerably since then. But demand for money probably remains
relatively high. With the very low level of gilt yields and term premia, financial investors may be willing to hold
relatively high levels of deposits as a low-risk alternative to gilts.18 More widely, households and non-financial
businesses are likely to want to hold higher levels of liquidity as a buffer against the very high levels of
uncertainty over incomes, profits and the future availability of credit. Previous experience suggests that firms
with higher liquidity levels are better able to weather economic storms – with greater resilience in investment,
and stronger trends in market share and profitability – than firms with lower liquidity levels.19 Of course, some
firms may be able to borrow instead, using their capital stock as collateral. However, credit availability in
general tends to worsen in downturns. And firms with a higher level of intangible capital (eg branding, R&D,
well-trained teams, specialised IT) may find that it is harder to use that capital as collateral, increasing their
incentives to hold larger buffer stocks of deposits.20

Before this pandemic, many households and businesses had quite limited financial buffers. The median level
held in bank deposits among UK households early this year was just £5,000.21 Roughly one third of
households have less than £1,000 in the bank (equal to less than two weeks of median disposable
income).22 For the UK non-financial business sector, aggregate top-down data suggest that the level of
sterling deposits before the pandemic was equal to roughly six weeks of turnover. The data show some

See Haskel and Westlake (2018). There is evidence that firms with high levels of intangible capital hold higher liquidity in order to
compensate for reduced scope to use their capital as collateral for borrowing. See Falato, Kadyrzhanova and Sim (2013) and Hosono,
Miyakawa, and Takizawa (2017). In addition, housing collateral is an important source of collateral for many firms, see Bahaj, Foulis and
Pinter (2020). Uncertainty over future house prices may therefore add to uncertainty over the future availability of credit, increasing
incentives to hold more liquidity.

sectoral variation, with relatively high figures for professional services, education and human health, and
relatively low figures in retailing and wholesaling (1-2 weeks), manufacturing (3-4 weeks), as well as
transport and storage (also 3-4 weeks). These averages are inflated by a few very cash-rich companies.
Across a sample of 70,000 non-financial companies for the latest available financial year (which in most
cases is 2018-19), roughly one third of companies have liquid assets equal to less than one week of
turnover.23 Slightly more than half of firms have liquidity equal to less than four weeks’ turnover (the median
is 3½ weeks of turnover). The median is even lower in some sectors, at just below 2 weeks’ turnover in retail
and wholesaling, as well as transport and storage. The median is around 3 weeks in manufacturing, as well
as accommodation and food services.

It is notable that the sectors which suffered the biggest declines in activity this year generally held relatively
low levels of liquidity before the pandemic. For example, in sectors where GDP in April-May fell by more than
25% YoY (eg accommodation and food services, manufacturing, retailing), the level of sterling deposits
before the pandemic was equal to only about four weeks of turnover (and the median among companies was
just 3 weeks).

Those levels of liquidity might have seemed adequate for the pre-Covid world; it is questionable whether they
are enough for the conditions that we now face. Consumer and business surveys highlight the mood of
caution. The net balance of consumers who intend to save more in the year ahead has reached a record
23

Liquidity is defined here as cash on hand and in the bank, along with any holdings of short-term investments (eg gilts and tradable
securities). National accounts data suggest that bank deposits account for more than 90% of this liquidity measure in aggregate. So
while this measure of liquidity is not quite the same as M4, there is a very substantial overlap.

high in recent months, according to the GfK/EC survey. The Deloitte CFO survey suggests that CFOs judge
uncertainty to be very high and expect further substantial declines in corporate revenues, cashflow and cash
holdings in the year ahead.
It appears to me that companies – particularly in the worst-affected sectors – have taken the chance to
stockpile cash as a buffer against future uncertainties. For example, sectors which saw relatively large
declines in GDP (and previously held relatively low cash levels) have seen relatively high deposit growth in
the last few months, reflecting high take up of official support schemes (including lending facilities) in these
sectors. For example, the growth of sterling deposits is now running at about 30% YoY on average in sectors
which saw GDP fall by at least 25% YoY in April-May. Within that, the YoY growth of deposits exceeds 35%
for the manufacturing sector, accommodation and food services, and also transport and storage. It is over
50% for retailers. Conversely, the upturn in deposit growth has been less marked in sectors which
experienced relatively small declines in activity (and which had lower take up of official support schemes).

With the rapid growth in deposits over recent months, aggregate corporate liquidity is probably up from about
six weeks’ turnover previously to between seven and eight weeks’ now. Assuming the growth in deposits is
evenly spread, the median level of liquidity among firms is probably up from about 3½ weeks of the normal
level of turnover to about 4½ weeks now. Given the advantages of holding high liquidity at present, that rise
does not look excessive in my view.

I suspect that many firms and households will want to hold higher liquidity for some time. Of course, if all of
the current uncertainties fade, then households and companies might feel willing to spend the funds
accumulated in the last couple of quarters. But that is really just another way of stating the obvious point that,
absent Covid-19, the current policy stance would probably produce strong growth. It is less likely to apply to
the situation we face at present.

***

So across these three issues (the recent rebound in activity, resilience of employment and strength of money
growth), the common factor is that the very large scale of monetary and – especially – fiscal policy support
has so far helped to cushion the effects of the severe drop in activity caused by the pandemic and lockdown.
Without that fiscal and monetary support, the recent rebound would probably have been weaker,
unemployment considerably higher and money growth markedly lower. Prospects for the economy would be
worse. In setting monetary policy, the MPC takes fiscal policy as given. But, as a monetary policymaker, it is
reasonable to note that, taken as a whole, fiscal policy has helped to reduce the burden on monetary policy
to support the economy and return inflation to target.

Looking Forward: Risks to the Outlook

Looking ahead, the outlook for the economy will depend in large part on dynamics of the pandemic, the
extent of progress in vaccines and other treatments, and the reaction of households, businesses and
governments to those developments. In the August MPR, the MPC assumed that improvements in vaccines
and treatments would allow the direct impact of Covid-19 on economic activity to gradually decline during
next year and fade by the end of next year. Conditioned on that, and assuming that the UK moves smoothly
to a CETA-like trade deal with the EU at the end of this year, the central forecast in the MPR was that the
economy will gradually recover such that excess capacity emerges in about two years, lifting inflation a little
above target three years ahead. The MPC judged that risks were skewed to the downside.

The uncertainties in the outlook are unusually high at present. The fan charts published in the August MPR
represent the MPC’s collective view and it is not unusual for there to be a range of views among individual
MPC members. My own view is that, relative to the August MPR forecasts, risks are on the side of a slower
recovery over the next year or two.

First, without being overly precise, a range of scenarios for Covid-19 are conceivable. In particular, it is
possible that, both in the UK and globally, we will be living with Covid for much if not all of the three year
forecast period. The evidence so far is that as lockdowns ease and economic activity recovers, infection
rates tend to rise again. The US has experienced this, it is now occurring in much of Europe, and there are
signs of rising infection rates in the UK. It is possible that there will not be effective vaccines in the next year
or two, or that vaccines will only provide short-lived immunity.
A lingering or persistent Covid scenario might not produce a renewed national lockdown. But it could well
result in a long period of rolling local lockdowns of varying sizes, some geographic, some sectoral, or on
certain demographics. Local lockdowns are unlikely to produce anything like the dramatic decline in GDP
seen in Q2. However, the resultant health uncertainties probably would also imply continued economic

14

uncertainty. In particular, unlike the national lockdown, local lockdowns have not so far been cushioned by
large additional fiscal support. There is no local version of the furlough scheme, Bounce Back Loans, or tax
deferrals. Households and companies will bear the economic costs of local lockdowns to a much greater
extent than for the national lockdown. The desire to self-insure against lockdown risk would probably create
widespread caution and a desire for higher savings among households and businesses.

A persistent Covid scenario also would probably imply greater structural changes in the economy that could
keep uncertainty high.24 For example, the airline and restaurant sectors might shrink markedly. Working from
home might remain the norm in some jobs, either for the whole week or part of it. This would cut demand for
office space and limit spending in city centres. It might imply downward pressure on pay and job security in
some sectors, by widening the available pool of labour for a job to include those who (perhaps for
geographic or personal reasons) cannot work at a specific location every day. Such structural changes might
create some winners, but would create a considerable number of losers.

Uncertainty over which scenario – an effective vaccine or persistent Covid – is more likely also will probably
weigh on spending. For some firms, investment projects that are profitable in the event of a successful
vaccine might be unprofitable if Covid persists.25 Firms won’t know which outlook to plan for.
The second issue is Brexit. Considerable uncertainties remain about the nature of the UK’s future trade
relations with the EU, the timing with which they will take effect, and whether the adjustment will be smooth
or disruptive. The DMP survey suggests that roughly half of firms expect that the UK will have a no-deal exit
from the current trading arrangements at yearend or next year. Relative to the MPR forecast, risks probably
lie on the side of a thinner trade deal, a less-smooth transition, or more persistent Brexit-related uncertainty.
More generally, global trade policy uncertainty remains high.

As seen in the last few years, conditions of persistent uncertainty create strong incentives for companies and
households to defer major spending decisions and to focus instead on greater balance sheet resilience.26

The third issue is that the neutral interest rate may have fallen further, such that the current level of monetary
conditions is providing less stimulus than intended. Back in 2018, the MPC estimated that the neutral rate in
coming years would be around 2¼% in nominal terms.27 Since then, rate expectations appear to have fallen
further from already low levels, as illustrated by the fact that the forward curve peaks at only about 1½%.
This decline in forward rates partly predates the Covid outbreak. It may reflect a further decline in the neutral
rate, caused by the same factors – such as demographics and low productivity growth – that helped reduce
the neutral rate in earlier years. And even if and when the direct effects of Covid eventually fade, the
25

For example, in a persistent Covid scenario, it might be worthwhile for firms to invest in more labour-saving technology and simpler
supply chains to reduce risks stemming from lockdowns. But such investment might not be worthwhile in a scenario where Covid
ceases to affect activity. Conversely, an airline might expand its fleet in the event that Covid ceases to affect activity, but not in a
persistent Covid scenario.

experience of having had such large economic swings may well lead to a preference for more robust balance
sheets and higher savings than in the pre-Covid period. Such psychological scarring could lead to some
persistent rise in risk aversion, and would thereby also weigh on the neutral rate.28

Some considerations in monetary policy

Let me finish with some comments on the appropriate setting of monetary policy at present.

In setting monetary policy, the MPC cannot prevent the significant structural adjustments to the economy and
individual sectors that may result from Covid-19. Monetary policy can help underpin the economy through
that period of adjustment by supporting demand and reducing risks of a persistent rise in spare capacity that
would leave inflation below target.

As discussed, my hunch is that risks lie on the side of weaker growth and a longer period of excess supply
than forecast in the August MPR, and hence of a more persistent inflation undershoot. Moreover, a downside
scenario would be very costly. It would imply greater longterm scarring on potential growth through
hysteresis effects. And, with relatively limited monetary policy space, it would be harder to return inflation to
target from below than from above. Risk management considerations imply we should lean strongly against
downside risks at present.29 The Committee noted at the August meeting that it would continue to monitor
the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit. I consider it
quite likely that additional monetary easing will be appropriate in order to achieve a sustained return of
inflation to the 2% target.

Of course, if the economy recovers strongly, then it is possible that less monetary policy support will be
needed over time. In this case, the MPC has ample scope and time to tighten before significant inflation
pressures emerge. But there is no automatic time limit on our willingness to maintain a loose monetary policy
stance. In particular, as the Committee noted in August, we do not intend to tighten monetary policy until
there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving
the 2% inflation target sustainably.

Appendix – A Panel Model of European Unemployment

We estimate a panel regression of 15 European countries in order to decompose the changes in the
unemployment rate into three channels:30


Demand – captured by quarterly GDP growth, which controls for the usual negative relationship between
unemployment and output (the so-called Okun’s law);



Furlough – captured by the participation in job retention schemes (JRS).31 Temporary state support for
firms’ labour costs allows them to retain staff for a time, acting as a buffer against the sharp drop in
output and labour demand; and



Labour market participation – proxied by the Oxford University’s Stringency Index, which records the
strictness of lockdown policies that primarily restrict people’s behaviour. To meet the ILO definition of
unemployed, an individual must have been actively seeking work in the past four weeks and be available
to start work in the next two weeks. Hence, policies which limit (eg because of restrictions on movement)
and/or disincentivise (eg because of school closures) work search will temporarily cap unemployment.

The results are shown in Table 1. Equation (1) shows the expected, negative relationship between
unemployment and GDP. Equations (2) and (3) suggest that stringency and furlough have each, individually,
been negatively correlated with unemployment, once controlled for demand. Equation (4) brings all the
channels together. As we might expect, it shows that the rise in the unemployment rate (given the fall in
output) has been capped by the use of furlough schemes, but also, mechanically, by the restrictions on
people’s behaviour. Given the expected evolution of GDP and the fading effects of government policy, the
model suggests that the UK unemployment rate will start to pick up from 2020Q3.
