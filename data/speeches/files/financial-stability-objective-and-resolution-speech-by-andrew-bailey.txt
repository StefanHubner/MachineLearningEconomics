Thank you for inviting me to speak at Pro-Manchester. It is a pleasure to be here.

Today, I will talk about the financial crisis that is now in its fourth year, and particularly about the new regime
of financial regulation that is being put in place.

There is, I am afraid, nothing new about financial crises. On one count there have been sixty different crises
since the early seventeenth century, and the first record of a bank panic dates back to at least Rome in
AD331. A common theme of the antecedents of financial crises is that they begin with a wave of optimism
and borrowing among consumers, companies, investors and governments.

One of the best modern descriptions of this sequence can be found in a book by the economists Carmen
Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. They summarise the sequence as one where: “excessive debt accumulation,
whether it be by the government, banks, corporations, or consumers, often poses greater systemic risks than
it seems during a boom. Most of these booms end badly”.2

Reinhart and Rogoff’s book goes under the

title “This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly”. Their response to the cry of this time is
different is to assert that “it almost never is.”

Why, then, is it so hard to understand the true picture of financial crises? I think that the issue here lies
clearly in the characteristics of banks. One of the conclusions of work on the history of financial crises is that
they have worse outcomes when they involve banks. As an example, if you remember the stock market
crash of 1987, which seemed very bad at the time, it did not threaten the banking system, and its effects
were contained. It was not a major financial crisis in its own right.

The reasons for this difference when banks are involved have to do with the nature of banks. At the heart of
banking is a technical term called maturity transformation, or more simply, banks borrow at a shorter term
and lend at a longer term in respect of the duration of their deposits and loans. This is the essence of
banking. Banks transform savings that may be required by their owners at short notice into longer-term
loans. This is a benefit to the economy and society because it allows longer-term borrowing by companies
and by all of us to buy houses. But it makes banks inherently illiquid. If all depositors decided to ask for their
money back at the same time the bank would struggle to pay-out and survive. This is because the bank will
generally find it difficult to realise its assets in time. Northern Rock represented the most extreme case of
this, the bank run, starting with wholesale creditors and then on to a full-scale retail creditor run. And it
follows from this assessment that banks depend upon maintaining the confidence of their depositors that
they will over time be able to meet claims on them. A very important part of maintaining confidence in banks
is that the value of their assets – the loans they make, to simplify – has not fallen below their sustainable
value in the accounts of the bank. In order to prevent this happening, banks maintain buffers of their own
funds – capital – which can be used to maintain the claims of depositors.

Here then we have the two fundamental elements of the safety and soundness of banks, liquidity and capital.
Banks are often said to fail either because they are insolvent (lack of capital) or because they are illiquid
(lack of funds to meet the claims of depositors to be repaid). My own experience of dealing with banks that
get into trouble suggests that the reality is somewhat different – it isn’t a case of either one or the other. On
the whole, banks lose deposits for a reason – depositors worry that there is something going on that they do
not like. The film “It’s a Wonderful Life” illustrates this point well. Rumours spread fast, depositors queue to
get their money out while the bank still has funds available. In the film of course James Stewart came to the
rescue, and he did that by convincing the queuing depositors that they should have faith in his bank.

Loss of deposits is a symptom of a wider problem – in other words, typically a bank becomes illiquid because
its depositors fear a problem which is more often than not to do with the expected future solvency of the
bank. I want to put the emphasis here on the word “expected”. Very few banks fail because they are
insolvent today. They don’t get that far. Typically, they fail because of a rising probability that they are
expected to be insolvent at some point(s) in the future. This is important because regulating banks has to be
forward looking, and in my view has not been adequately so in the past.

It also means that a problem in a bank can spread to create a problem in the wider financial system, so
called systemic risk. Maintaining the stability of the financial system – financial stability – is therefore at the
heart of the efforts of the authorities to prevent problems in banks spreading out of control. The financial
crisis of the last three and a half years has illustrated starkly what can happen when financial stability is not
maintained. So, establishing and maintaining financial stability should be high up everyone’s agenda, and
we should embed financial stability as the objective of public policy towards regulating the financial system.

You can reasonably ask, why is this difficult to achieve? Financial stability is difficult to define quantitatively
and precisely. Some people say that you know it when you have it, but it might be better to say that you
know when you don’t have it.

What is being done to tackle the issue? A month ago, the Government issued a consultation paper which
seeks to define the financial stability objective that will be given to the new Financial Policy Committee of the
Bank of England under its plans. The objective is defined at the high level as protecting and enhancing the
stability of the financial system of the UK. More precisely, the Bank’s objective “relates primary to the
identification of, monitoring of, and taking of action to remove or reduce” risk to the stability of the UK
financial system as a whole or to a significant part of the system, “with a view to protecting and enhancing
the resilience of the UK financial system”. But the paper goes on to include in the objective the statement
that: this does not require or authorise the Bank “to exercise its function in a way that would in its opinion be
likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of
the UK economy in the medium or long term”. Here then we have the recognition of the need to have regard
to the impact of financial regulation on the long-run growth of the economy. To back this up, the

Government intends to include in the legislation a power for it to provide the Bank with guidance in the form
of a remit which would provide greater clarity on the overall approach the Bank should take to pursue its
objective. That remit is likely to be more a matter of words than a single number like the inflation target, but it
is the right approach to seek to set this out as explicitly as possible.

There are at least three things that need to accompany such an approach, none of which by the way is
unusual to this area of public policy. The first is transparency, namely the clarity of explanation of the
objective and how it is pursued. Transparency is an important part of the monetary policy framework – the
same approach can be used for financial stability.

The second necessary tool is accountability to Parliament. Again, this is a well-established feature of
monetary policy and is already well embedded for financial stability.

A third necessary element of financial stability policy is to have an approach which recognises the
importance of the spirit as well as the letter of the law. I believe lawyers call this a purposive approach to
interpreting legislation and regulations – in other words interpreting meaning in the context of regulations
rather than a literal interpretation. This is necessary because history shows us that the financial services
industry can be addicted to arbitraging regulations – exploiting the rules to suit short term purposes rather
than longer-term stability.

I want to finish by saying something about a further important feature of financial stability. For me, the most
unacceptable aspect of the financial crisis is that large banks have required the support of so much public
money. This is often called the Too-Big-To-Fail problem, or better the “Too-Important-To-Fail-thereforepublic-money-has-to-be-used” problem . Why are large banks in this position? The root of this issue is
common to the key features of banks, namely their dependence on the confidence of depositors, the role of
banks providing each of us with the facility to manage our money – our savings, and in our everyday lives in
terms of payments – and the externality caused by the failure of one bank spreading a loss of confidence to
other banks.

The failure of any company should be dealt with, wherever possible, using the standard insolvency or
bankruptcy laws of the country. These provide a well-established and predictable framework for dealing with
company insolvency. But, the insolvency laws do not operate quickly – resolving a company can take time.
For a standard company, this will not matter in the sense that there is an externality in terms of loss of
confidence in other like companies. But this is not true for banks. If ordinary depositors get locked into an
insolvency process, there can be both hardship and unacceptable loss and the real risk of spillover to other
banks. And yet, when a bank fails, decisive action is required to solve the underlying problem. This was the
problem with Northern Rock – the only action that could be taken promptly was to use public money, initially
in the form of a guarantee by the Government.

For the last three years, we have had a special resolution regime for banks in the UK, initially in the form of
emergency legislation, and for the last two years in the form of permanent powers given to the Bank of
England. The resolution powers give us the right to speed up the insolvency process, subject to a series of
legal safeguards which limit what we can do to affect people’s property rights in their money. The central
aim of resolution is to enact a solution which ensures that depositors have access to their money and the
supply of credit to the economy does not suffer an unacceptable disruption. Resolutions are possibly the
most stressful thing you can do as a central banker. Fortunately, we don’t do them very often. The aim is to
get the failing bank to a weekend and give ourselves that time to effect the resolution. There is one question
that has to be answered by 8am on Monday morning – when the depositor asks: “Is my money safe”, you
have to be able to say yes, no hesitation or qualification.

The reason I have described this is that, while we have a resolution regime, and we are ahead of many other
countries in this respect, it is a regime for small and medium-sized banks. We are working very hard to solve
the too important to fail problem for big banks. But, until we do so, we haven’t solved the big problem that
we have seen in the last four years, the dependence on public money. A healthy industry is one in which
within an industry that is fundamentally sound, companies can fail, and new companies can enter to replace
them without an unacceptable cost to society. That will be the objective of the new Prudential Regulation
Authority. From a resolution perspective, we need a regime in which failure is orderly, and the cost of failure
is borne by the capital holders and, if necessary creditors of the failed bank. This is a big issue on which a
lot of work is currently underway.

Very important changes are under way in financial regulation. These put the stability of the financial system
at the heart of the objective of regulation. Financial stability is a necessary condition to allow the pursuit of
other good objectives of public policy – avoiding mis-selling, competition in the provision of financial services
etc, things that are rightly not done by the Bank of England but are important to society. Financial stability is
not a superior objective to these other goals, but it is in my view a necessary condition to achieve them.
And, in reforming regulation we should have in mind that a healthy and competing industry is one that does
not rely on the support of public money, either explicitly or implicitly.

Thank you.
