A year ago I described the period since the early 1990s as a non-inflationary consistently
expansionary – or “nice” – decade; a period in which growth was above trend,
unemployment fell steadily, and inflation remained low and stable. The ups and downs
of the economy were much smaller in the nice decade than in any previous historical
period. Will this stability last?
To answer that question it is necessary to understand the causes of our new-found
stability and, in particular, the link between growth and inflation. In the long run there is
no trade-off between the two. Monetary policy determines inflation and the supply
capacity of the economy determines the rate of growth. In the short run, however, it is
reasonable to suppose that when the economy is running at above-normal levels of
capacity utilisation there is upward pressure on inflation, and the opposite to hold when
the economy is running below capacity. Such, at least, is the conventional wisdom. But
over the nice decade inflation was much less sensitive to movements in output and
employment than in the earlier inflation-prone 1970s and 1980s. Inflation barely moved
despite substantial falls in unemployment. Indeed if you were to plot inflation against
unemployment on a chart – described by economists as the Phillips’ curve – you would
see not a downward-sloping line of the conventional wisdom but a completely flat line.
Over the nice decade, the unemployment rate fell from nearly 9% to below 3% on the
claimant count measure. Yet over the same period, inflation was broadly constant and
never deviated from its target rate by more than 1 percentage point. Not only was there
no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, there was no short-run tradeoff either. As a result, both inflation and unemployment were lower than the Monetary
Policy Committee had expected. And the inflation figures released this morning, with
CPI inflation at only 1.1%, show that inflation has remained low – below the 2% target –
despite a tight labour market. The position was very different in the 1980s.
Unemployment then fell by a similar amount, from around 11% in 1985 to just over 5%
in 1990. But inflation rose from 5 to 9.5%.
How should we interpret this reduced sensitivity of inflation to changes in
unemployment? Does it mean that the economy can grow faster than before without

2

leading to a pickup of inflation? Or is there a risk that the apparent insensitivity of
inflation to movements in the economy is only temporary, and might lead to mistakes in
monetary policy if low inflation were taken for granted? To answer those questions, I
want to consider three possible explanations for why inflation has not so far risen despite
substantial falls in unemployment and spare capacity.
First, reforms enacted over the past twenty-five years have made the labour market more
flexible and lowered the rate of unemployment consistent with stable growth in money
wages. Incentives to work have increased – through initiatives like the New Deal and the
Working Tax Credit. Benefits paid to the unemployed have fallen relative to earnings.
And the share of wage settlements covered by collective bargaining has fallen sharply.
Those reforms, and a steady growth in total money spending, ensured that unemployment
fell in almost every quarter since 1992 while wage inflation remained broadly stable.
Moreover, changes in unemployment have resulted in smaller movements in the rate of
wage increases than in the past. It is possible that migrant labour may be easing the
bottlenecks and skill shortages in what is undoubtedly a tight labour market. Reports
from our business contacts around the country, collected by our Agents, suggest that
migrant labour is indeed relieving some of those shortages, more so in recent months
with recruitment from the new members of the European Union. Migrant workers are
employed in fish processing here in the South-West, and even in the production of
Cornish pasties, as they are in an increasingly wide range of industries in manufacturing,
construction and services. That may be suppressing signs of underlying wage pressure
that would otherwise have become evident by now.
Second, an increase in the pace of productivity improvement may have made it possible
for output to grow more rapidly without adding to inflationary pressure. On the face of it,
however, there is little evidence for this hypothesis. Productivity in the private sector –
measured as output per hour worked – has grown at an annual rate of around 2 ½ % since
1995, around the average rate in the period 1980-1995. In the United States, private
sector productivity growth increased from 1 ½ % in the earlier period to almost 3% after
1995. It is striking that productivity growth in the private sector was higher in Britain

3

than in the United States for most of the past quarter of a century, although our level of
productivity remains inferior. Only in the past few years has American productivity
accelerated. No such change is yet visible in the official data for the United Kingdom. It
is possible that the effect of productivity improvements, especially the temporary boost to
profits, was obscured by the impact of the rise in sterling since 1996 and by global
competition which have lowered prices and compressed margins. So it is too soon to
dismiss the possibility of an acceleration in productivity similar to that experienced in the
United States. Indeed, productivity growth has increased to more than 4% over the past
year. Revisions to the official data and the volatility of measured productivity –
reflecting the business cycle – make it extremely difficult to infer changes to long-term
growth rates. The absence of any compelling evidence for a rise in underlying
productivity growth suggests that this is an unlikely explanation for consistently low
inflation over the past decade.
Third, the new monetary policy framework – a symmetric inflation target and the
transfer of interest rate decisions to an independent Bank of England – has helped to
anchor inflation expectations to the target. It is less likely now that a shock to inflation
would lead to a further and persistent deviation of inflation from target. There is a belief
that inflation will soon return to target. As a result, a surprise movement in inflation is
expected to be temporary and so less likely to lead employers and employees to adjust
their desired prices and wages. And there is convincing evidence that changes to
inflation are much less persistent under the new monetary policy arrangements.
So there you have it: three possible explanations for the recent low and stable level of
inflation despite falling unemployment and rapid output growth. But this is no time for
complacency or hubris. Part of the improved short-run trade-off between growth and
inflation may reflect temporary factors. Inflation may have been close to target because
of one-off explanations, such as increased competition that temporarily depressed retail
prices relative to costs, or larger flows of migrant workers that have temporarily held
down wage inflation. And even if inflation expectations are well anchored to the target
they will remain so only if interest rates continue to be set to keep inflation close to the

4

target. The 1980s provided a stark example of a rapid acceleration of prices with few
early warning signs. From 1983 onwards, RPIX inflation was stable – relative to recent
experience at that time – with most of the outturns in the 3.5% to 5.5% range until mid1989, and wage inflation was high but not on any clear upward path. Within a year, and
despite a 6 percentage point increase in interest rates between 1988 and 1989, RPIX
inflation reached 9% and wage inflation exceeded 10%. Inflation expectations, as
measured by surveys, began to rise as soon as inflation itself took off.
What does this analysis mean for the future path of interest rates? For some time the
Monetary Policy Committee has been expecting a rebalancing of the economy as
domestic demand, especially consumer spending, slowed in order to make room for faster
growth in public spending, net exports and investment. Revisions to the official statistics
suggest that consumer spending has slowed to a more sustainable rate over the past two
years from its heady pace during the previous five years. Investment has now picked up,
growing by over 7% over the past year. And this has been against the background of the
fastest growth of the world economy for almost thirty years. The British economy is
facing strong pressure of demand on supply capacity, on the one hand, and low inflation,
below the 2% target, on the other. Whether that combination can or will continue is, as I
argued earlier, not easy to know.
Since our August Inflation Report, the rise in oil prices, now at their highest level in real
terms for twenty years, has moderated somewhat the outlook for the world economy.
And there have been two developments at home, with conflicting implications for
inflation. First, there are some signs that the economy is experiencing a softer patch after
rapid growth in the first half of the year, even if the official production data are not
entirely easy to square with business surveys. Second, sterling has fallen significantly, by
some 4% on its effective rate against all other currencies, from its previous high level,
and there is continuing rapid expansion of total money spending, broad money and credit.
Looking ahead the MPC will have to balance the impact on inflation of this evidence of
weaker activity against the fall in sterling and other signs of cost pressures. The

5

implications for interest rates will depend on developments in the economy which the
MPC will monitor carefully both in the official figures and through our regular visits to
this and other parts of the United Kingdom. So, if you are interested in the future path of
interest rates, don't read my lips, read the economic data!
What is clear, however, is that the combination of low and stable inflation and
continuously falling unemployment must come to an end at some point, and may already
have done so. Starting, as we do now, with little if any spare capacity, it is unlikely that
we can expect unemployment to fall indefinitely. From time to time shocks will hit our
economy, as we have seen with oil prices and world trade, and so there will be
fluctuations in growth and unemployment, as well as in inflation. Unemployment can be
maintained at lower rates than in the past, even though there will inevitably be times
when it will rise because no monetary policy can hope to prevent all fluctuations of
demand, output, and hence employment. The nice decade we might expect to be
followed by the not-so-bad decade.1
Moving from a nice to a not-so-bad decade would still represent a significant
improvement in our economic fortunes compared with the period of high inflation. We
must be conscious of the dangers of hubris. After all, starting from the Garden of Eden
there can be only a fall from grace.
ENDS

For those looking for a suitable acronym let me suggest that the degree of stability to which we can
reasonably aspire, in comparison with the nice decade, will be not of the same order but also desirable, or
not-so-bad.
