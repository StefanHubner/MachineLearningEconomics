It is fantastic to be here at Glanford Park Stadium, home of Scunthorpe United Football Club. I remember as
a boy learning about how Liverpool legends Kevin Keegan and Ray Clemence started their careers here.
Cricketing legend Sir Ian Botham started (and ended) his professional football career here too. A couple of
weeks ago, my home town Guiseley entertained Scunthorpe in a pre-season friendly. Scunthorpe won 2–0.

Off the football pitch, it has not been all wins for Scunthorpe recently. Problems at the British Steel plant in
the town have put at risk the jobs of 5,000 workers and a further 20,000 in its supply chain.1 Hopefully, a
new buyer can be found and jobs in the town and beyond can be assured. This is the latest chapter in what
has been a long and sometimes painful story for the UK steel industry recently. It has been a recurrent
theme of my visits around the UK, including in Redcar and Port Talbot.
The loss of signature industries can leave lasting social and economic scars – jobs lost, families disrupted,
communities decimated. It is a pattern we see repeated across many industries in many advanced
economies. It has been a key cause of the disaffection and disconnection felt by many and a potent
polarising force in our politics, policies and societies. This polarisation is also a potent force shaping the
fortunes of our economies, as I will go on to discuss.
The travails of the steel industry lead me neatly to the issue I want to discuss today – jobs and pay. In the
UK recently, this has been a good news/bad news story. The good news has been the new jobs created –
the best jobs recovery in the UK since at least the Second World War. The bad news has been the subdued
performance of pay over much of that period – the weakest pay performance the UK has experienced since
at least the Boer War.

I will first discuss recent developments in jobs and pay, before providing an account of them centred on
movements up and down the jobs ladder. I will then turn to recent developments in the world and UK
economies and their potential implications for monetary policy.
The Jobs Boom
The past few years have been a jobs bonanza in the UK. Since 2012, 3.4 million net new jobs have been
created. Table 1 compares job creation across previous periods of UK economic recovery. No economic
recovery since the Second World War has seen as many new jobs created. This leaves the UK employment
rate at its highest (61.5%) and the unemployment rate at its lowest (3.8%) in half a century (Charts 1 and 2).

This jobs bonanza has had a broad geographic base. Since 2012, unemployment has fallen by at least 4
percentage points in all corners of the UK (Chart 3). Unemployment here in Scunthorpe has also fallen
significantly from its peak of over 11% during the financial crisis but, at around 7 ½%, remains well above the
national average.

A high quantity of new jobs is no guarantee of quality. Yet recent job creation has also been encouraging on
that front. Of the jobs created since 2012, over 2.7 million or around 80% have been full-time. Around half
(over 1.7 million) have been taken by women. Employment rates among the youngest (aged 16-24) and
oldest (aged 55+) have both risen strongly, by around four to five percentage points, respectively.
The jobs bonanza has been fairly broadly-based across the occupational spectrum too (Chart 4). Unusually,
all of the main categories of occupation have seen a rise in employment rates since 2012. As elsewhere,
this boost has been largest at the higher-skill (such as managers and directors) and lower-skill (such as
elementary occupations) ends of the occupational spectrum, with the mid-skilled benefitting least.2

Despite a slowing economy, this large and evenly-distributed jobs bonanza has continued apace. The stock
of available job vacancies – a measure of aggregate demand for workers – currently stands at around
830,000, close to its all-time high. After seven years of continuously creating jobs, and continuously falling
unemployment, the UK labour market remains in rude health.
It also appears to be tight. One way of gauging that comes from comparing the stock of vacancies (V) in the
economy (aggregate labour demand) with the stock of people seeking work (U, aggregate spare labour
supply). Chart 5 plots two measures of the V/U ratio in the UK.3 They are at their highest since the 1960s.
Both ratios also well in excess of 100%, suggesting demand for labour exceeds available supply.

3

The broader measure is the vacancy-effective searcher ratio, where effective searchers are a weighted average of the employed,
unemployed and non-participants. The weights on the employed and non-participants are their job finding probabilities relative to the
job finding probability of the unemployed. The unemployed therefore have a weight of one.

Other evidence confirms that picture. The UK unemployment rate (3.8%) is below the Bank’s estimate of its
long-run equilibrium rate (or NAIRU) of 4 ¼%. In business surveys, a majority of companies point to acute
skills shortages across a range of professions and industries. When I asked on a recent visit to Northern
Ireland about businesses’ top three concerns, the answer was revealing: skills, skills and skills.
Surveys of workers tell a similar tale. Households’ outlook for their financial situation is currently in line with
historical averages and well above troughs in previous economic downturns (Chart 6). It is easy to be blasé
and to forget just how big a societal shift this represents. Job insecurity was the scourge of the latter part of
the 20th century. During the 21st, and in particular over recent years, that scourge appears finally and
thankfully to have lifted.

The Pay Bust
A tight labour market is usually a recipe for rising pay. Yet until recently, there was little sign of pay picking
up closer to rates seen before the crisis. Chart 7 plots inflation-adjusted pay in the UK over the past
70 years. For the first 60 of those years, real pay growth grew steadily at over 2 ¼% on average each year.
Over the past 10 years, real pay growth has averaged minus 0.4% – a “lost decade” for the average worker.
Despite some recovery recently, that leaves the inflation-adjusted pay of the average UK worker still over 5%
lower today than it was just prior to the crisis. You have to go back to the 19th century to find a similar period
of stasis in UK living standards. The UK’s jobs bonanza has been accompanied by a pay disaster.

These falls in real pay have been widely spread geographically. Chart 8 compares average real wage rises
across UK regions in the ten years either side of the global financial crisis. In the ten years prior to the crisis,
all regions experienced annual rises in real pay, averaging between 1.3% (Wales) and 2.2% (London).
These pay rises were roughly in line with pre-crisis economic growth rates.

Over the past decade, average growth rates of real pay in every UK region have fallen into negative territory
and well below average GDP growth rates in the economy over the same period (1.3%). The worst-affected
regions have been the East Midlands and London. Scunthorpe has been towards the lower end of this pack,
with real pay falling by, on average, 0.8% per year over the past decade.
The distribution of real pay rises across the wage distribution tells a nuanced story (Chart 9). In the decade
prior to the crisis, real pay growth was fairly evenly distributed. The one exception was the top two wage
deciles, where real pay growth averaged 2 ¼% – 0.5 percentage points higher than in the lower deciles.
The global financial crisis (2008-11) saw a sharp and significant amplification of these pre-crisis trends. The
distribution of real pay rises fell below zero for all income groups. But while for the top two income deciles
real pay shrank by only 2%, for the bottom two deciles it fell by 4%. This widened pre-existing wage
inequalities. For the poor, this really was a Great Recession.

Notes: Data based on real weekly pay (using CPI as the deflator).

During the subsequent period of jobs recovery (2011-17), these distributional patterns went into reverse.
Lower deciles of the wage distribution experienced real pay rises. For the bottom three deciles, these
averaged around 1 ¼% per year. They came, at least in part, courtesy of the National Minimum and,
subsequently, the National Living Wage. By contrast, real pay among the upper pay deciles continued to fall
over this period. Wage inequalities began to shrink.
Until, that is, 2018 when real pay of the bottom two wage deciles fell by a further 2%, partly reflecting the
effects of sterling’s depreciation after the referendum which pushed up consumer prices faster than wages.
The upper wage deciles appear largely to have been insulated from these pressures, with real pay rising by
around 1% among the top two wage deciles.
Comparing the past 10 years as a whole, real pay today is lower at every point along the wage distribution
and, with the exception of the bottom decile, by broadly similar amounts of around 5% (Chart 10). These
real pay falls have been felt by both men and women, by the young, middle-aged and young, and by the low,
medium and high-skilled. The lost decade of pay was an equal-opportunity disaster.
Alongside this period of stasis in real pay have been some important on-going shifts in the nature of work.
There has been strong growth in Alternative Working Arrangements (AWA), such as self-employment,
zero-hours contracts and agency work (Chart 11).4 The number of self-employed, zero-hour contract and
agency workers in the workplace has increased by 1.1 million, 0.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively, over

lines may reflect increased awareness and reporting.

These structural shifts in the workplace are often called the “gig economy”. Their common denominator is
greater working time flexibility in the jobs contract. For some, this increased flexibility has been welcome. In

10

10

surveys, around 30% of workers says they have benefitted from this flexibility, particularly female workers
(re-)entering the workforce and older workers tapering into retirement.5
For others, though, these shifts in working arrangements have been a cause for concern. In surveys, around
half to two-thirds of workers say they would prefer either to be working more hours or to have greater
certainty around their hours.6 For them, AWA are not welcome flexibility but unwelcome insecurity. The
TUC estimate that as many as 1 in 9 workers may be in work which is insecure in income terms.7
This income insecurity has been a key and recurrent theme in my recent discussions with charities, faith and
community groups across the UK. For some, these income insecurities have been worsened by the
introduction of Universal Credit. This has added time lags in payments to claimants, caused rising concerns
about benefits sanctioning and has heightened uncertainties about eligibility for work criteria.8
Recent research by the Resolution Foundation has found that pay volatility in fact affects a significant
number of UK workers, not just those on low pay or the gig economy.9 Over 90% of those who remained
with the same employer during 2016-17 experienced at least one month when their take-home pay varied by
more than 5%. This pay volatility is more prevalent for those on lower earnings and among the young.
Income volatility appears to have significant welfare costs for workers. A recent study found the average
worker would be willing to sacrifice a fifth of their wage to avoid a variable work schedule set by their
employer.10 In practice, gig workers tend to be paid less not more. Pay of self-employed and zero-hours
contract workers lies significantly below employed and permanent contract counterparts (Chart 12). This is a
malign coincidence of lower and less certain income.

These changes in the nature of work are likely to have contributed to the recent weakness of pay. The
creation of larger numbers of, on average, lower paid jobs will have had a direct, dampening effect on pay.
And income insecurity and the lack of unionisation among gig workers may also have lowered their pay
bargaining power.
Summing up, then, a jobs boom has reduced the scourge of job insecurity that troubled workers in the past.
But in its place has emerged a different scourge – static or lower pay and rising income insecurity. Job
insecurity at the end of the 20th century has given way to income insecurity at the start of the 21st. This
insecurity is an important part of the explanation for recent patterns in jobs and pay.
The Jobs Ladder
The framework most often used by macro-economists to explain pay and jobs is the Phillips curve – the
negative relationship between pay growth and the stock of unemployment.11 Despite reports of its demise,
there is still reasonably clear empirical evidence of a Phillips curve in labour market data, once allowance is
made for a possible downwards shift in the NAIRU and/or slope of the Phillips curve.12
An alternative, complementary, lens on the labour market comes from looking at flows of workers between
jobs, rather than stocks of unemployed. There is a large literature studying the process by which people
search for work and are matched into jobs.13 There is empirical evidence that job-to-job flows – the velocity
of circulation in the labour market – can play a significant role in explaining wage growth.14
When studying labour market flows, a “jobs ladder” pattern of behaviour has often been found. In a growing
economy, workers move between jobs by climbing a ladder of opportunities based on job characteristics
such as relative rates of pay and firm productivity. The tighter the jobs market, the harder it is for companies
to fill vacancies, the greater their incentive to offer workers higher-paid positions and the stronger the
incentives among workers to move into these positions.15,16
More productive firms are better able to offer higher rates of pay. This means more productive firms are also
the ones most likely to expand, as they bid-away workers with higher pay offers. Less productive firms, by
contrast, are unable to pay-up and are more likely lose workers and shrink. As workers climb the pay and
productivity ladder, we would thus expect to see simultaneously higher levels of job moves, and higher rates
of pay and productivity growth.17

The reverse is true during a slowdown. Then, rates of hiring fall and rates of job transition slow. Workers
are either forced off the jobs ladder entirely (“unemployment”) or, in coordination with employers, the labour
market outcome results in them moving to a lower rung of the pay and productivity ladder
(“under-employment”). Lower-productivity firms expand while higher-productivity firms shrink. The result is
slower rates of job move and lower rates of pay and productivity growth.
One of the attractions of this approach is that it explains the velocity of circulation in the labour market, pay
and productivity growth as a single, simultaneous process as workers traverse the jobs ladder. We do not
need to rely on unexplained shocks to productivity to explain pay. Rather, it is behaviour by companies and
workers which generates simultaneous movements in pay and productivity.
So how useful is this framework when characterising recent behaviour in the UK labour market? At a high
level, this story fits the UK facts. Chart 13 plots job-to-job flows in the UK over recent decades. It displays a
pro-cyclical pattern, with job moves picking up during a recovery and falling during a recession. From their
low point in 2010, job-to-job flows in the UK have picked up as the labour market has tightened.

Hiring and quit rates among companies are also pro-cyclical, as we would expect. More than that, the
degree of pro-cyclicality in hiring is strongest, and in firing is weakest, among the medium and large firms.
To the extent size is a proxy for productivity, this is also as we would expect.18 During expansions, more
productive firms hire more, and lose fewer, of their workers than less productive firms (Charts 14a and 14b).
Other patterns in the data less obviously fit the facts, however. Despite jobs flows picking up, pay growth
has until reasonably recently remained slow and low. Meanwhile, productivity growth has remained

stubbornly subdued despite a seven-year jobs recovery. So has the jobs ladder broken? Have its rungs
been removed? To understand these developments, it is useful to break the decade down into phases.

(a) Descending the Jobs Ladder
The global financial crisis generated a sharp fall in output. Given that fall, the subsequent rise in
unemployment was more modest than expected. Between 2008 Q1 and 2009 Q2, UK output fell by around
6 ¼%, while unemployment rose by just over 2 ½ percentage points. By comparison, in the early 1990s
recession output fell by around 2% peak-to-trough, while the unemployment rate increased by over
2.5 percentage points.

Put differently, in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, unemployment rose by less than was
expected by most mainstream forecasters, including the Bank. Chart 15 shows Bank forecasts for
unemployment in early-2009 and early-2010. Having expected unemployment to peak at over 10.5%, the
eventual peak of 8.5% was reached in late-2011.
More recently, the “Okun’s Law” relationship appears to have steepened as weak productivity growth since
the crisis has seen unemployment fall sharply since 2012 despite more modest GDP growth (Chart 16).

Notes: Chart shows calendar year GDP growth plotted against annual percentage point change in calendar year average

A different way still of illustrating, and explaining, these developments comes from looking at job moves. As
the crisis struck, job-to-job movements fell. Instead of moving between jobs, workers instead transitioned
into unemployment. But these transition rates into unemployment rose by less than in previous recessions.
Workers and their employers bargained to remain on the jobs ladder rather than jumping-off.
Remaining on the ladder did, however, come at a cost in terms of pay. For workers staying in the same job
this meant accepting pay freezes, with the fraction of workers accepting these rising sharply during the crisis
(Chart 17a). For workers moving, this meant moving down the jobs ladder by accepting lower-paying jobs at
lower-productivity firms: the fraction of switchers taking pay cuts spiked during the crisis (Chart 17b).
Median wage growth for switchers fell from over 9% in 2007 to 4 ½% by 2010 (Chart 18).

At the time of the global financial crisis, then, workers and their employers were faced with a stark outcome
of job insecurity (jumping off the ladder) or income insecurity (stepping down the ladder). Unlike in previous
recessions, most chose the latter path. The result was lower-than-expected unemployment, but weaker pay
and productivity growth.

(b) Climbing the Jobs Ladder
As the economy recovered after the crisis, so did aggregate jobs growth. In response, workers began to
climb the jobs ladder, with transition rates between jobs rising. We would expect this to have then boosted
aggregate pay and productivity, as workers rotated into higher-paying, more productive firms. In practice,
this process appears to have been sluggish for pay and to have stalled for productivity. Why?
There appear to have been two effects at play in slowing the rate of climb up the jobs ladder. First, although
the rate of jobs transition picked up, it did so only slowly, especially given the degree of underlying strength
in the jobs market. Despite picking up, the velocity of circulation in the labour market has remained relatively
subdued in the face of the biggest jobs bonanza since the Second World War.
Job-to-job transition rates have only just reached their pre-crisis levels after seven years (Chart 13). And
that still leaves them around 25-30% below their peaks in the 1970s and 1980s. This relatively subdued
pattern is even more striking if we compare transition rates with the degree of tightness in the labour market,
defined by the V/U ratio (Chart 19). This suggests job-to-job transitions have not really picked-up at all over
recent years, when measured relative to the strength of the jobs market.

What explains these subdued rates of job transition? A strong candidate is that 21st century scourge, income
insecurity. The crisis scarred risk appetite. Risk-aversion discourages workers from moving to reach higher
rungs up the jobs ladder.19 It also discourages companies from offering workers those higher-rung positions.
Risk scarring slows the velocity of circulation in the jobs market and hence pay and productivity growth.
One rationale for risk-aversion in moving to higher paid jobs at a different firm could be so-called “last-in-first-out” whereby new
workers are mostly likely to lose their jobs in the event of redundancies.

This risk-aversion has not been confined to those switching jobs; it has also affected those staying put. A
reluctance to move reduces these workers’ bargaining power, weighing on their pay. Put differently, if
companies are less fearful of workers being poached, for a given degree of the strength in the jobs market,
they will feel less need to pay-up to retain those workers.
There is evidence of this behaviour in the differential pay growth of stickers and switchers recently
(Chart 20). Switchers have consistently experienced higher rates of pay growth than stickers, as we would
expect. But it is striking how this differential has widened as the labour market has tightened over recent
years, with movers securing pay increases of 7-9%, while stickers’ pay growth has until recently flat-lined at
2-2½%.

(c) Rungs on the Jobs Ladder
The second dynamic at work is that even those climbing the ladder have tended to do so at a less rapid pace
than in the past. Or, put differently, the rungs in the jobs ladder have been closer together. This, too, may
have reflected workers’ unwillingness to move occupation, industry or geography at a time of increased
income insecurity.
The Resolution Foundation has recently looked at rates of movement between UK regions.20 They find that
rates of geographic mobility – people taking a new job in a different region – has been lower since the crisis
than in the preceding period. Their analysis finds that this reduction in mobility is driven by the young and, in
particular, young graduates. Graduates under the age of 35 were close to 6 times more likely to move region
and employer than non-graduates in the 1990s but are now just 3 times more likely. And mobility has
decreased for both groups.

Charts 21 and 22 look at rates of worker transition between different industries and occupations. These
moves are grouped into “rungs” on the ladder, where the rungs for the 9-rung occupation ladder are ordered
by the standard ONS classification, which itself reflects differences in skills used within each occupational
group. For the 21-rung industry ladder, the rungs are ordered by the mean hourly gross pay of workers
within each industry, across the whole sample period. The blue zone defines zero rung movements. The red
zone defines large upward rung movements and the grey zone large downwards movements.

Notes: Chart shows percentage of jobs moves based on extent of upward or downward movement along the occupational job ladder.

During the crisis, we would expect a larger number of moves down the industry and occupational ladder.
There is some evidence of that, with the lower tail (grey zone) fattening and the upper tail (red zone) thinning
a little. Thereafter, as the jobs market recovered, we would expect a fattening of the upper tail (red zone)
and a thinning of the lower (grey and blue) zones. There is no real evidence of that. The zone of small rung
movements has remained fairly static.
We get a similar story if we look at the company destination for jobs moves, ranked by productivity. We
would expect to see workers move down the productivity ladder during downturns and to rescale that ladder
during upturns. The first part of that story is borne out in the data. Rates of productivity gain from a job
switch fell from around 8% pre-crisis to around 3% afterwards. More surprising is that there has been no
recovery in these rates of productivity gain during the subsequent jobs recovery (Chart 23). The rungs in the
jobs ladder have had a smaller productivity spacing than in the past.

Notes: Chart shows percentage difference in productivity between new firm and old firm with the median workers moves between firms.

Summing up, then, a strong jobs recovery has not resulted in workers vigorously re-climbing the jobs ladder.
Both their willingness to climb, and the pace of this climb, has been subdued relative to the strength and
tightness of the jobs market. Post-crisis risk aversion, and changes in the nature of work, may have
increased insecurities and dimmed workers’ appetite for a vertiginous career climb – or indeed any climb.
The result has been subdued rates of pay and, in particular, productivity growth.
Just recently, some of these patterns in pay, if not productivity, have begun to reverse themselves. Nominal
pay growth has been going slowly through the gears over the past few years, from being in the “low 2s” three
years ago, to the “high 2s” 18 months ago to having a “3” in front of it now. Private regular pay growth is
currently running at 3.7% year on year.
The reasons for this rise can also be found, to some extent, in job dynamics. There is only modest evidence
that those moving position are climbing the ladder any faster. But it is notable that, as the labour market has
tightened and skill shortages have emerged, we have seen pay growth among stickers beginning to rise after
a long period of tranquillity. In other words, employers’ increased appetite to retain staff, and employees’
increased willingness to consider moving, appears now to be affecting pay.
This might also help explain why, although pay has picked up (as stickers are rewarded not to move), there
is little sign so far of productivity following suit (as job moves towards higher-productivity firms have not
picked-up). With productivity subdued alongside higher pay, growth in annual unit wage costs is now
running at elevated levels of over 2 ½% year on year.21 That is in excess of levels consistent with meeting
the Bank’s inflation target and begs a question about the stance of monetary policy, to which I now turn.

A Polarised Economy
At present, we are being fed a rich daily diet of news about polarisation in our politics and societies, globally
and nationally. Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that there are also signs of polarity when it
comes to the prospective fortunes of our economies, globally and nationally. Certainly, downside risks to the
global and UK economy have increased through this year.
At the global level, a key current source of risk is trade. For a 60-year period after the Second World War,
barriers to trade were significantly and systematically dismantled, courtesy of multilateral trade liberalisation
initiatives. Almost 300 global trade agreements were reached between 1950 and 2018 (Chart 24). As a
result, global tariffs have fallen by two-thirds since the early 1990s (Chart 25).22
The dismantling of trade barriers ushered in a halcyon period of rising trade peace and prosperity. Global
goods trade volumes grew, on average, by 10% per year between 1950 and 2008. Global supply chains
lengthened and deepened.23 A post-War consensus forged global cooperation in trade, finance and security,
embedded and embodied in the Bretton Woods institutions which this year celebrate their 75th birthday.

Notes: Weighted global mean of all applied tariffs across all products.

Recently, that tide of cooperation, including on trade, has shown signs of turning – what Mark Carney
recently called a “sea change”.24 After a prolonged period of peace, trade wars are now being waged: tariffs
have been introduced on over $200 billion of bilateral goods trade between the US and China; further
US-China tariffs are threatened; and there are ongoing trade tensions between the US and Mexico and the
US and Europe. These developments are reverberating around global financial markets and among
companies.
Among global investors, trade wars have risen to the top of their worry lists. Negative trade news has
weighed on global equity and corporate bond prices and government bond yields, as investors have sought
safety. Chart 26 shows the responsiveness of a selection of global asset prices to (positive and negative)
trade news. Asset prices have been particularly responsive to trade news during 2019.

Trade tensions are also taking their toll on companies’ sentiment and activity. Global goods trade has
slowed (Chart 27). But the weakening has been even more striking in business surveys of sentiment,
manufacturing and export orders. This weakening has been broadly-based across the world’s major trading
economies, with simultaneous falls in sentiment across the United States, Asia, Europe and China.

It is notable that movements in global asset prices and companies’ expectations appear to have been large
relative to the modest announced tariff increases. Based on the higher trade tariffs announced so far, and
using standard trade models, we would expect a negative impact on global growth of a few tens of basis
points.25 The adjustments in asset prices and business survey responses have been multiples of that.
One way of beginning to make sense of this puzzle comes from casting our minds back a decade. Back
then, we also saw outsized responses in global asset and output markets following a modestly-sized shock –
a collapse in the US sub-prime market which at the time accounted for less than 1% of global wealth. This
market’s collapse prompted the sharpest fall in global output and asset prices since the 1930s.
We now have a much better sense of why: closely inter-connected global markets, once disrupted by deep
uncertainty, can cause contagious collapses in confidence, output and asset prices as participants take
precautionary action through fight or flight.26 This is the economics of infectious diseases. The stronger the
connections, and the greater the uncertainty about them, the larger the potential scale of the epidemic.
A version of this contagion problem may be operating now. The network is the world trading system and
global supply chains rather than global interbank and security markets. And the uncertainty surrounds import
tariffs rather than sub-prime defaults. But the same precautionary responses, whether fight or flight, appears
to be in play, causing out-sized responses in asset prices and activity.

Chart 28 plots the global trade network on two dates – 1980 and 2018. The wiring of the global trading
system has become conspicuously more dense over that period, with the ratio of trade to GDP increasing by
50%. This increased connectivity in the world trading system has generated huge benefits. But that same
connectivity has also increased the system’s potential to transmit recent fear and loathing, as uncertainties
have clouded its future.

These concerns about global trade, output and asset prices have had significant knock-on effects to global
financial conditions. Expectations of short-term interest rates in the major advanced economies have fallen
by around 60 basis points, and global bond yields by around 70 basis points, since the start of the year.27
This leaves global financial conditions 0.9 standard deviations looser than at the end of last year (Chart 29).

purchasing power parity (PPP) weights.

The UK economy has also been facing high and rising degrees of uncertainty about future trade, though the
source has been different – Brexit. According to our Decision Maker Panel, the number of companies
reporting Brexit as among their top three risks have risen from one-third in April 2018 to around 50% now.
Most recently, the perceived risk of a “no deal” Brexit has risen, with betting odds placing a roughly 30%
probability on that event, double the probability earlier this year.
With no precedent, it is very difficult to gauge the economic impact of a “no-deal” Brexit. One simple way of
doing so is simply to ask companies how they think it would affect them. This is something the Bank’s
regional Agents have been doing since late-2018. Chart 30 shows companies’ expected responses for
output, employment, investment and exports under “no deal/no transition” and “deal with transition” scenarios
using the combined results of four surveys from December 2018 to April 2019.28
The expected responses to a “no deal” are negative, significantly so. Output is expected on average to fall
by 3 ½%, employment by 3% and investment by 1 ¼%. By contrast, expected responses to a deal scenario
are all positive. Looking at the different waves of the survey, the good news is the expected negative effects
of “no deal” were somewhat smaller in the later waves compared to the first in December 2018. That likely
reflects the significant increase in Brexit planning and preparation, by companies and the government, over
that period.

Notes: Chart shows aggregated results from surveys from December 2018 to April 2019.
Companies were asked ‘Relative to the last 12 months, what is the likely impact on the following for your business over the next year in
each scenario: a deal and transition period and no deal and no transition period?’ For each relevant business factor, respondents were
asked to choose between ‘Fall greater than 10%’; ‘-10 to -2%’; ‘Little change’; ‘+2 to +10%’ and ‘Rise greater than 10%’.
Responses weighted by employment. Half weight was given to the +/- 2-10% response and full weight was given to those that
responded 'Rise/fall greater than 10%'.
The approximate estimated change for output, employment, investment and exports are based on a simple calculation assuming a midpoint figure for each of the response categories. For “Fall greater than 10%” the mid-point was -15%; for “-10 to -2%” the mid-point was 6%; for “Little change” the mid-point was 0%; for “2 to10%” the mid-point was +6%; for “Rise greater than 10%” the mid-point was
+15%.

The likely accuracy of these expected responses is extremely unclear. But “no deal” expectations are
already affecting financial markets. As the perceived probability of a “no deal” Brexit has risen, sterling has
weakened and UK short-term interest rates have shifted downward (Chart 31). Having expected rates to rise
modestly at the time of the May Inflation Report, financial markets now expect UK interest rates to fall over
the next year or so, before rising gradually.

This forward path of interest rates is, in practice, a rather peculiar one. It is likely to reflect a probabilityweighted mix of two quite different possible outcomes for the economy – a “deal” scenario in which the
economy grows and a “no deal” scenario in which some expect it could shrink. In that sense, the market
path of interest rates is not an accurate reflection of the most likely path of interest rates.
To illustrate, consider a simple thought-experiment. Assume, in the event of a “no-deal”, the economy
followed the course expected by companies in Chart 30. Assume also, in that event, that monetary policy
followed a simple Taylor Rule and that inflation was unaffected.29 These are clearly very stylised
assumptions. Nonetheless, on those assumptions, a Taylor Rule would suggest interest rates would need to
be cut sharply to their zero bound, to cushion the hit to growth.
If we do the same thought-experiment under the “deal” scenario, again using a simple Taylor Rule, we get
instead an upwards-sloped trajectory for expected interest rates, on average 25-50 basis points higher than
the slightly upward-sloped market path for interest rates prevailing in May. Clearly, these are two very
different interest rate trajectories, reflecting two quite different Brexit economic outcomes.30

In the event of a ‘deal’, upward pressure on demand would also likely be accompanied with a stronger exchange rate, so the ex-ante
impact on inflation is ambiguous.
30
My MPC colleague, Jan Vlieghe, made a similar point in his recent speech (Vlieghe (2019)).

The market-implied path for interest rates is a probability-weighted mix of these two paths. With a 30%
probability of “no deal”, this expected path would have interest rates falling in the near term before rising
gently thereafter. Despite our scenarios being highly stylised and simplified, this expected path broadly
mirrors the current market yield curve.
In practice, as the MPC has emphasised, the actual path of interest rates in the event of either Brexit
outcome would never be automatic; it will depend on the response of demand, supply and the exchange
rate to these outcomes. This is impossible to predict in advance. If a “no deal” were to lead to a sharp fall in
sterling and a sharp rise in inflation expectations, it is not clear the MPC could cut interest rates, as the
market expects, if it was to meet its inflation mandate. The risks to rates in a “no deal” scenario are in that
sense two-sided, if not necessarily symmetric.
This bi-polarity in possible economic outcomes poses a dilemma for UK monetary policy. Monetary
policymakers are often cast as one-club golfers. In the current conjuncture, the problem is more that the
MPC does not know which of two quite different fairways it should be aiming at. Brexit uncertainty is not, by
itself, a reason for leaving interest rates on hold, as the two tightenings in monetary policy by the MPC since
the Brexit referendum demonstrate. Nonetheless, with the economic road ahead potentially forking, the case
for holding rates until the road becomes clearer is strong.
With Brexit uncertainty high, the global economy softening and other major central banks expected to loosen
monetary policy, it is not difficult to see why short-term interest rates have fallen and are now pricing a nearterm loosening of UK monetary policy. UK growth is expected to stall in the second quarter. Companies’
investment remains strikingly and significantly subdued. Business sentiment is weak. And UK growth for
the year as a whole, at less than 1.5%, is expected to lie below potential.
My personal view, though, is that I would be very cautious about considering a monetary policy loosening,
barring some sharp economic downturn.
First, despite some Brexit-related volatility quarter-to-quarter, underlying UK growth remains fairly steady, if
not spectacular, at a fraction below its cruising altitude. Consumer confidence and spending remain robust,
underpinned by a still-strong jobs market and rising real pay. The UK housing market may be bottoming-out.
When British consumers have more money in their pockets, it takes a lot to persuade them not to spend it.
Nothing so far has dissuaded them. And they are three-quarters of all spending in the economy.
Second, the starting position for both the economy and monetary policy need importantly to be borne in
mind. As best we can tell, there is little, if any, slack left in the UK economy. That is why pay is picking up at
pace. UK inflation, meanwhile, is already at target and the monetary stance remains accommodative, with
short-term real interest rates still negative, augmented by almost £½ trillion of asset purchases.

Third, there is sometimes a tendency in the current environment to extrapolate from international experience,
or recent historical experience, to the current stance of UK monetary policy. That is dangerous when the
starting point for the UK economy, and the shocks to which it is potentially subject to, are very different to our
overseas counterparts or indeed the UK’s own recent past.
Since the start of the year, UK short-term interest rates have moved in lockstep with those in the major
economies, notably the US and the euro area. The correlation of daily changes between them has been
around 0.7, a little above its historical average. Common exposures to a slowing global trade cycle can
explain some, if not all, of this correlation. But what stands out, for me, are the differences as much as the
similarities between the UK, US and euro-area economies.
Chart 32 is a simple plot of unemployment against short-term real interest rates in the UK, US and euro area
over the past 20 years. You might expect a negative relationship between the two: the lower
unemployment, the smaller slack in the economy and the higher the level of real interest rates necessary to
prevent inflation rising. This is broadly what you see in the data.
Also shown in the chart are the current settings for the UK, US and euro area (the darker dots). The US has
low levels of unemployment and, courtesy of a progressive tightening of policy over recent years, a nowpositive – if still low – real interest rate. The euro area is in the opposite place, with a higher level of
unemployment and a still-negative short-term real rate.

The UK occupies an unusual, mid-Atlantic position. It has similar levels of real interest rates to those in the
euro area, at the same as having similar levels of unemployment to those in the US. Put differently, relative
to both the US and the euro area, and its historical past, the current UK monetary stance looks relatively
accommodative. For the same output gap and a higher rate of inflation, the UK’s monetary stance is
2 percentage points looser than in the US.
There may well be good grounds for these international differences – for example, differing levels of neutral
real rates and different natural unemployment rates. Nonetheless, the very different starting positions of the
economy and monetary policy should give us cause to pause before simply assuming central banks should
be moving synchronously, even when faced by a common global shock.
One reason why financial markets might be over-extrapolating international experience is because, at least
since the crisis, monetary policy internationally has borne most of the burden of supporting growth in
advanced economies. Over that period, central banks have often been “the only game in town”.31
I believe that game made economic sense. The crisis led to a large gap opening-up between aggregate
demand and supply in the economy. Pump-priming aggregate demand back towards aggregate supply,
through accommodative monetary policy, was the right policy response. And this monetary medicine, as
best we can tell, worked. In the UK and US, aggregate demand is now back in line with supply. And in the
euro area and Japan, the output gap has shrunk materially.
Today, however, the conjunctural starting position for most advanced economies is very different than a
decade ago. With the output gap closed in the UK, economic growth and pay rises in future can no longer
rely on monetary policy pump-priming demand. It will instead require a lasting expansion in the economy’s
supply potential, if capacity constraints are not to bite and inflationary pressures are not to snuff out pay
rises.
It is not just the economic starting point that differs, now versus a decade ago. So too do the potential
shocks. A decade ago, the world faced a sharp shock to aggregate demand courtesy of the global financial
crisis. This opened-up yawning output gaps and fed fears of the scourge of 1930s-style mass
unemployment returning. Monetary policy responded with a force never previously seen in history.
Today, the most likely shocks or downside risks to the economy are very different in their source and impact.
They arise from factors such as global trade wars and Brexit. These shocks are different in their duration –
more slow-burn than spontaneous conflagration. And they are radically different in their source, as they hit
the supply potential of the economy, as much as its demand side.

Consider the effects of Brexit uncertainty on the UK economy. By far the largest effects have been on
companies’ investment and productivity. According to our Decision Maker Panel, investment among UK
companies is estimated to be between 6-14% lower, and firms’ Total Factor Productivity (TFP) around 2-5%
lower.32 These are large negative shocks to the economy’s supply-side potential. They are hits that
monetary policy is not itself well-placed to mitigate.
There is a risk of people normalising the deviance in monetary policy since the crisis. Around a quarter of
adults in the UK working population have never experienced Bank Rate above 1% in their adult lives.33 In
these changed circumstances compared with a decade ago, it is important that monetary policy is not a
prisoner of its past, that the monetary cavalry are not called at the first whiff of grapeshot, that a dependency
culture around monetary policy is not allowed to develop.
A decade ago, central banks were the only game in town and monetary medicine was the right prescription.
A decade on, the game has changed and so too might the policy prescription needed in dealing with any
downturn. When the challenges, as well as the huge opportunities, lie on the supply-side of the economy,
the right medical prescription is fiscal and structural policies. Super-charging the supply-side of the economy
is what is now needed. That is every bit as true here in Scunthorpe as it is elsewhere across the UK.
