I would like to thank Alina Barnett, Rohan Churm and Michael Hume for their considerable help in
preparing this speech. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of other

The MPC is in the dock.

The remit of the Monetary Policy Committee is clear: to hit the 2% inflation target. But inflation in February was
4.4% – well above the target. It has been above target for much of the past 5 years. And it is likely to remain so
for the next year or so.

At the same time, monetary policy remains at extraordinary loose levels. This month marks the second
anniversary of Bank Rate being reduced to 0.5%; it’s lowest ever level. And the stock of asset purchases
financed by central bank reserves – QE – remains at £200 billion.

There is an onus on the Committee to explain how its actions are consistent with its remit. There is a good case
for the defence. But we need to continue to make it.

It needs to be made if international investors, such as many of you here this morning, are going to continue to
have the confidence to invest in the UK.

More generally, it needs to be made to preserve the accountability and credibility of the Committee.

The MPC is accountable for hitting the inflation target. Developments in the rest of the world certainly affect us.
And inflation will not always be close to target. But ultimately UK inflation is our responsibility: it is made and
controlled in Threadneedle Street.

The credibility of monetary policy relies on companies and households having confidence that the Committee
will keep inflation close to target. After a series of failed monetary frameworks in the 1970s and 80s, the gains
in credibility associated with the introduction of inflation targeting and the creation of an independent policy
committee greatly improved the functioning of our economy. The task of maintaining low and stable inflation
was made substantially easier, and we enjoyed a sustained period of economic stability. We lose those hardfought gains at our peril.

The MPC stands charged on four counts. Why is inflation so high? Why has inflation been so much higher than
we expected? Could inflation remain high? And how is the current stance of policy consistent with the inflation
outlook?

My task today is to make the case for the defence.

Why is inflation so high?

On the first count – why is inflation so high – the case for the defence has been advanced by a number of my
colleagues in recent months and so hopefully will be familiar to many of you.1 Over the past few years, our
economy has been hit by a series of large price level shocks – to oil and other commodity prices, to VAT, and to
the sterling exchange rate – which have raised companies’ costs and put upward pressure on prices. Together
these factors can more than account for the strength of inflation.

Indeed, recent analysis in the Bank’s Inflation Report suggests that these factors can account for a rise in the
level of consumer prices since the beginning of 2007 of between 8-12%.2 This dwarfs the extent to which
inflation has exceeded the 2% inflation target over the same period.

Now, if we really were in a Court of Law, I fear the Judge may be looking down on me at this point with a degree
of disdain, suggesting that this sounds like a series of excuses. “Inflation is inflation”, he or she may say,
“whatever its cause. Your job is to keep inflation close to target”.

I’ve considerable sympathy for this argument: the high and variable rates of inflation seen in recent years have
affected the ability of both households and companies to plan their spending and investment decisions with any
degree of certainty.

But the remit of the MPC recognises that trying to keep inflation at target in the face of large shocks and
disturbances ‘may cause undesirable volatility in output.’3 I fear that to some this might sound like I’m resorting
to technical loop-holes to bolster my defence. But that is not the case. This element of the remit has been
central to the operation of monetary policy in recent years.

The foremost task of monetary policy over the past few years has been to ensure that the financial crisis did not
lead to a prolonged depression. To have offset these price level shocks would have meant presiding over an
even deeper recession. I’m not saying that if I had had perfect foresight, I wouldn’t have changed my policy
stance at all. But the hurdle for wanting to have had materially tighter policy in the face of the most severe
downturn in the post-war period is pretty high.

But this argument is hypothetical. As many of you may know, the MPC did not have perfect foresight. Indeed,
far from it! Which leads to the second charge against the MPC: why has inflation been so much higher than we
expected?

See for example the speeches by Bean (2011), King (2011), Miles (2011), and Posen (2011).
See the box on page 34-35 of the February Inflation Report. The box explains how a range of estimates suggest that these factors
might have added between 6% - 10.5% to the level of prices between 2007 and the end of 2010. My numbers update this analysis for
the recent impact of the January 2011 VAT rise and additional increases in energy and import prices.

The relevant clause of the remit states “The framework is based on the recognition that the actual inflation rate will on occasions
depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances
may cause undesirable volatility in output.” See http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/open_letter_from_chx_to_boe_22032011.pdf

Why has inflation been so much higher than we expected?

On the Committee, we always stress that the uncertainty associated with forecasting inflation means that the
forecasts – and outturns relative to those forecasts – should be judged in terms of the entire forecast distribution
rather than a single point forecast. But even viewed in this way, inflation in recent years has turned out
significantly higher than we thought at all likely. Consider, for example, the forecast the Committee made two
years ago in February 2009. At that time, the probability the Committee attached to inflation being above 3% in
2010 was less than 5% in each quarter. In the event, CPI inflation was above 3% in every quarter of 2010 and
averaged 3.3% (Chart 1). However viewed, there is a prolonged period of unexpectedly high inflation that needs
to be explained.

That explanation comes in two halves, with the source of the inflation surprise in 2009 different from that in
2010.

In 2009, our surprise largely stemmed from the extent to which the increase in import prices associated with
sterling’s depreciation was passed through into higher consumer prices. The MPC's initial judgement was that
over the next few years less than half of the increase in import prices would feed into higher UK consumer
prices, with the remainder being absorbed in margins or lower nominal wages. This judgement was based in
part on a number of influential studies made in the years prior to sterling’s depreciation which suggested that the
degree of exchange rate pass-through in many countries, including the UK, had fallen significantly during the
period of Great Moderation. Indeed, a general view had emerged amongst many academics and
commentators that pass-through in many major economies had fallen close to zero.4

The MPC’s initial judgement that around 40% or so of the increase in import prices would pass through into
consumer prices was at the top end of this emerging view. However, that judgement now looks woefully
optimistic compared to the degree of pass-through we think has occurred, which is closer to 100%.5 This error
of judgement can more than account for the surprising strength of inflation through 2009 (Chart 2).

However, it accounts for much less of the surprise in 2010, since the extent of additional pass-through has
lessened as time has gone on.6 Instead, the 2010 surprise largely stems from the sharp pickup in import price

4

Taylor (2008) argued that the global economy had experienced a reduction in the degree of exchange rate pass-through in recent
years. Microeconomic studies attributed this decline to increased globalisation, which increased competition between domestic and
foreign firms (Campa and Goldberg (2006)). Macroeconomic studies argued that this was due to monetary policy’s focus on price
stability which caused prices to adjust more slowly (Devereux and Engel (2001), Taylor (2000, 2007), Devereux, Engel and Storgaard
(2004)). Empirical studies such as Ihrig et al (2006), found that the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices in the U.K. had
fallen from 0.20 before the 1990s to almost zero thereafter; similar effects were found in other G7 countries with the exception of
Germany.
5
The February 2011 Inflation Report (Section 4 and the box on pages 34-35) describe estimates which suggest that import price
increases since 2007 have added 4% to 6% to the overall price level. This equates to pass-through of between 66% and 100%. I
discussed some reasons for why the degree of pass-through may have been larger or at least faster than predicted by earlier studies in
a speech last year (Dale 2010).
6
The analysis presented here is based on the forecast made in February 2009. The extent of the surprise stemming from the degree of
exchange rate pass-through in subsequent forecasts reduced more quickly than suggested by this analysis since the MPC learnt from
this high pass-through and adjusted subsequent projections accordingly.

inflation seen through much of last year, driven by the surge in commodity prices. At the time we made the
February 2009 forecast, we expected import prices to increase only slightly in 2010. In the event, the prices of
oil, food and metals increased by between 20 and 40% during 2010, leading to a further bout of import price
inflation.

These higher commodity prices directly affect the prices of the food and energy we consume. But the effects go
wider than that. Higher metal prices raise the cost of imported cars. Likewise, cotton prices and the cost of
clothes. All told, the unexpected increase in commodity and world trade prices can account for the lion’s share
of the surprising strength in inflation in 2010 (Chart 3).
So there are two significant factors accounting for the recent extended period of higher than expected inflation.7
In 2009, the surprising strength largely reflects greater than expected pass-through from sterling’s depreciation
into consumer prices. There were good reasons for thinking that the degree of pass through may be relatively
limited, but by the start of 2010 that judgement was shown to have been wrong and we have incorporated close
to full-pass through in forecasts since then. By contrast, the unexpected strength of inflation through much of
2010 largely stems from the surge in commodity prices.

Could inflation remain high?

To summarise: there’s no great puzzle as to why inflation has been above target for much of the past few years.
Our economy has been subject to a series of large shocks – to oil and other commodity prices, to VAT, and to
the sterling exchange rate – which have raised inflation. The scale of these shocks can more than account for
the overshoot of inflation relative to target. Moreover, it is possible, albeit with the benefit of hindsight, to explain
why inflation in recent years has been higher than we expected.

But that is all in the past. What matters for monetary policy are the prospects for inflation over the next 2 to 3
years.

My broad view of the inflation outlook is similar to that described in the February Inflation Report. Inflation will
probably rise further in the near-term as recent commodity price increases pass through the supply chain. But
further out, inflation is likely to fall back as the temporary impacts of the price level shocks wane and the slack in
the economy associated with the deep recession from which we are only gradually recovering continues to pull
down on inflation. But the risks and uncertainties associated with the inflation outlook means it is impossible to
know with any certainty by how much and over what period inflation will moderate.
7

There are of course many other elements of the MPC’s forecasts which have differed from what was projected. For example, previous
Bank analysis (see the box on pages 48-49 of the August 2010 Inflation Report) has highlighted the smaller than expected impact from
the weakness of demand. Acting in the opposite direction, it appears that consumer-facing companies may have squeezed their
margins by more than had been anticipated during 2009/10. The various changes to VAT during this period have also complicated the
task of forecasting inflation. However, relative to the February 2009 forecast considered here, changes in VAT did not contribute
significantly to the surprising strength of inflation in 2009/10, since the effects of the temporary reduction in VAT in December 2008 were
included in that forecast, and the main impact of the more recent increase in VAT did not come through until the first quarter of this year.

Indeed, it is quite possible that inflation may be considerably higher or lower than the central view taken in the
February Report. This leads to the third item on our charge sheet: could inflation remain high? The simple
answer to this question is – I’m afraid – yes. I would highlight two risks in particular.

The first is that global price pressures continue to add to domestic inflation. There are a number of potential
channels through which this could operate.

At first blush, the most natural suspect might appear to be a continuation of the recent rapid increases in the
prices of oil and other commodities. As I said, commodity prices have increased sharply over the past year and
the strong demand from emerging economies, especially China, which has underpinned much of that rise, looks
set to continue.8 But this ignores the fact that one of the reasons why commodity prices increased so much
through 2010 was exactly because demand was expected to remain strong.

Indeed, looking ahead, futures prices are broadly flat. Now there are many reasons why commodity prices may
not be expected to follow exactly the path implied by futures prices. For example, if investors require a positive
risk premium for holding commodities, or because some commodities cannot be easily stored. And further
sharp movements in commodity prices are certainly possible. But I wouldn’t expect to see rapid increases in
commodities prices of the like seen over the past year unless global demand turned out to be significantly
stronger – or supply weaker – than currently anticipated.

But inflation at home could also be affected by more general inflationary trends. Average inflation in the largest
emerging economies increased from 2.8% to 5.3% last year.9 This in large part reflects rising local and global
food prices. But overheating in many emerging economies is playing an increasing role. These economies
account for a little under 20% of the UK’s imports. So if inflation remains elevated in these countries this could
have a material impact on domestic inflation.

Under some circumstances, we may expect the impact of high inflation in overseas’ economies to be offset by a
corresponding depreciation in their exchange rates. But where economies operate pegged exchange rate
regimes it is far from clear that this can be relied upon, at least in the near term.

A third external factor which could add to domestic inflation is if there is further pass-through from the past
depreciation of sterling. Our central view is that there has been close to 100% pass through in terms of the
direct impact of higher import prices on to consumer prices. But it is hard to be precise about the exact degree
of pass-through, and the range of estimates included in the February Inflation Report suggest that pass through
to date may be as low as two-thirds. Moreover, it is quite possible that pass-through may exceed 100% if

Events in Japan and the Middle East and North Africa have also had an important influence on commodity prices in recent weeks. Oil
prices have increased reflecting fears of supply disruption and heightened risk premium, but some non-oil commodity prices have fallen
in response to concerns about weakening demand.

companies making domestically produced goods and services are able to use the increased competitiveness
associated with sterling’s depreciation to widen their margins.10

So there are a number of potential channels through which developments abroad may affect domestic inflation.

But to repeat a point I made up front: inflation is home made. If we think that global price pressures are likely to
push up on CPI inflation for an extended period, UK monetary policy will need to be set in such a way as to
reduce domestically-generated inflation, and so leave room for these external price pressures. And to respond
to an argument I have seen made by a number of commentators in recent months. No: raising Bank Rate will
not directly dampen global inflation. But it can ensure that it does not lead to high and persistent domestic
inflation.

The second upside risk to inflation that I would highlight is if the prolonged period of above target inflation
erodes the public’s confidence that the MPC will keep inflation close to target.

Inflation has been above target for 49 out of the past 60 months. Over that 5 year period, inflation has averaged
2.8%. Inflation is likely to remain above target for the next year or so. This suggests that by mid 2012, inflation
is likely to have been above target for the best part of six and a half years.

Yes, it is perfectly possible to explain why inflation has been so high for so long. And yes, there are good
reasons why monetary policy did not try to keep inflation closer to target during this period. But just like the
Judge looking down on me earlier, to some people, at some point, this may just start to sound like a series of
excuses. This risk is heightened by the fact that the MPC has consistently under-predicted inflation during this
period. It is much easier to be wise after the event. For many people, the one thing about inflation they know
with certainty is by how much their cost of living has increased in recent years. And if they take any signal from
that about the path of future inflation, this could have significant implications.

Discussions of MPC credibility are often framed in terms of a set of binary arguments. Has the MPC lost its
credibility or not? Are inflation expectations anchored or de-anchored?

This approach encourages a focus on measures of medium-term inflation expectations. The rate of inflation
expected over the next year or so may consistently move around since the MPC does not attempt to bring
inflation back to target over very short time horizons. But this line of argument suggests that the stability of
inflation expected 5 or 10 years ahead provides a good metric for judging the credibility of monetary policy.

10

In the extreme, the law of one price (LOOP) suggests that, in the absence of transport costs and trade barriers, the price of a given
commodity will be the same all over the world. Even though the LOOP is unlikely to hold perfectly, the mechanisms underpinning LOOP
might cause a sterling depreciation to lead to an increase in the prices of some domestically produced goods and services.

The evidence on medium and long-term measures of inflation expectations is somewhat mixed. The most
recent survey conducted for the Bank by NOP suggests that 5-year ahead inflation expectations increased by
0.4% points over the past year. The corresponding survey measures collected by Citigroup/YouGov and
Barclays have risen by similar amounts. But both the Citigroup/YouGov and Barclays measures remain below
the levels they reached in 2008. And measures of medium-term inflation expectations derived from financial
markets are little changed compared to a year ago.

But I’m cautious about how much comfort we can take from the relative stability in these measures for two
reasons.

First, although some economists may like to think otherwise, most companies and households have far better
things to do than spend time formulating detailed expectations of the rate of inflation likely to prevail in 5 or 10
years time. Many may use simple rules of thumb to form views about future inflation, such as ‘inflation will be
equal to the target’.11 Or they may base their expectations on the views they hear expressed by others or they
read about in newspapers.12 Importantly, expectations formed in this way may be relatively sticky.13 Rules of
thumb are only changed when they perform poorly over a period of time. Expectations based on the views of
others may be updated only occasionally. As such, it may be some time before we see the full effects of the
extended period of above target inflation fully reflected in inflation expectations.

Second, and more fundamentally, I worry that this binary approach to monetary policy credibility – credible or
not credible, anchored or de-anchored – misses the key risk to inflation expectations. Despite some of the more
lurid newspaper headlines, I don’t believe that many people think that the Monetary Policy Committee has
adopted a secret aim to keep inflation above the 2% target indefinitely. Given that, I don’t find it surprising that
when asked, many survey respondents have not significantly raised their expectations of inflation in the medium
term.

More likely, however, is that some companies and some households may look back at the prolonged period of
above target inflation and infer that the Committee has perhaps become more tolerant of deviations of inflation
from target. As such, inflation may be expected to return to target more gradually. Rates of inflation expected to
prevail in 5 or 10 years may not increase, but inflation expectations 2, 3 and 4-years ahead may well do. This
risk is almost impossible to monitor since information on the term structure of inflation expectations, especially
for households and companies, is very sparse. But it could have profound implications for the inflation outlook
and the performance of our economy.

If companies and households expect inflation to return to target quickly they will set their prices and pay
demands accordingly. And in so doing, monetary policy has less to do – in terms of varying the level of demand

in the economy – to ensure that it does. Inflation credibility is self reinforcing. The credibility gains associated
with the move to inflation targeting and an independent policymaking committee in our country led to a reduction
in the persistence of inflation. Inflation came back to target more quickly and the cost of it doing so in terms of
output volatility was reduced.14 If companies and households begin to expect that inflation will be returned to
target more slowly that would harm the efficient functioning of our economy. Wage and price setting behaviour
could change. The task of keeping inflation close to target would become more costly. Inflation persistence
would increase. We need to guard the gains in credibility built up over the past 15 years or so.

How is the current stance of policy consistent with the inflation outlook?

The existence of these upside risks leads to the fourth and final charge levelled against the MPC. Is the
current stance of policy consistent with the inflation outlook?

As I’ve explained, the central view of the Committee – which I share – is that much of the current strength of
inflation is driven by a series of price level shocks. Inflation is likely to fall back next year, as the temporary
impacts from these factors wane and the persistent slack in our economy continues to pull down on inflation.

That outlook drives the current stance of monetary policy. Policy needs to remain highly accommodative in
order to support spending and income and so reduce the risk of inflation significantly undershooting the
target in the medium term.

But there is considerable uncertainty about the extent to which inflation is likely to fall and over what time
period. That uncertainty maps into differing views as to exactly how accommodative monetary policy needs
to be.

On the one hand, there is a risk that the strength and durability of the recovery may disappoint. Our
economy still faces considerable headwinds, especially within the household sector, where real incomes
have been squeezed and many families may not yet have adjusted fully to the implications of the substantial
fiscal consolidation now in train.

On the other hand – as I’ve discussed – there is a risk that inflation may remain higher for longer than
currently expected. Either because global price pressures continue to add to domestic inflation or because
the persistent period of above target inflation starts to become ingrained in wage and price setting behaviour.

It is still too early to reach any firm conclusions, but it seems likely that the terrible events in Japan and the
political upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa will add to both of these risks. The huge disruption in

There was a reduction in the persistence of UK inflation without an increase in the volatility of output. Benati (2006) found that the
inflation targeting period has been the most stable macroeconomic period in UK history. Some have argued that this was due to lower
and less volatile shocks hitting the UK economy (Benati and Mumtaz (2007)) while others have argued this was due to better monetary
policy (Batini and Nelson (2005), Nelson and Nikolov (2004)).

Japan and the uncertainty associated with events in Libya are likely to dampen global demand, at least in the
short run. But the accompanying increases in energy prices are likely to add to domestic inflation.

At the MPC meeting two weeks ago I voted to raise Bank Rate to 0.75%.

Even with this increase in rates,

the stance of monetary policy would remain highly stimulatory. Bank Rate would still be close to an historic
low and the stimulus from our programme of quantitative easing would be unaffected. But I judged that
removing some of the monetary stimulus was warranted.

I would like to tell you that this judgement was driven by ‘nice’ reasons. That I was confident that the
recovery would continue apace. That the very low level of Bank rate reached at the depth of the recession
was no longer needed. That we were in a position in which monetary policy could begin a gradual process of
normalisation.

But I’m afraid these nice reasons were not the factors driving my decision. In particular, I’m not at all
confident about the strength of the recovery. My central view – similar to that in the February Inflation Report
– is that growth is likely to be close to its average historical rate over the next few years. But that is a pretty
disappointing outlook given the depth of the recession from which we are recovering. And there is
considerable scope for growth to surprise to the downside, particularly if households retrench further.

Rather, my vote to raise rates was driven by a concern that – despite a relatively weak outlook for growth –
the risks to the inflation target in the medium-term were to the upside. In particular, the risks from continuing
global price pressures and the effects of the prolonged period of above target inflation meant that the level of
demand consistent with achieving the inflation target had probably fallen.
Nasty reasons rather than nice ones.15

I should stress that I’m not at all certain that this will turn out to have been the right policy decision. A key
lesson I learnt from the financial crisis is that economists know a lot less about the economy and how the
economy works than many would like to believe. Policymakers need to approach their task with humility and
pragmatism. If growth turns out to be materially weaker than I anticipate or other medium-term pressures on
inflation ease unexpectedly, I will reverse my decision. But with growth expected to be around its average
historical rate, inflation likely to remain above 4% for the rest of this year and Bank Rate at record low levels,
some withdrawal of policy stimulus seems sensible.

The juxtaposition of high inflation and loose monetary policy means that there is an onus on the MPC to
explain its actions. The case for the defence needs to be made. And we have a good story to tell. We can
explain why inflation has been above target for much of the past few years. We think we understand – albeit

Mail on 1 February 2011.

with the benefit of hindsight – why we have been surprised by the strength of inflation. And we have learnt
from those episodes. I can’t say that monetary policy will perfectly anticipate every twist and turn of the
economy. We will continue to be surprised by events and need to adjust policy accordingly. But I can
assure you that the MPC remains as committed and as focused as ever in our determination to hit the
inflation target.

(a) The black line in these charts shows CPI inflation in
2009/10 relative to the February 2009 IR modal inflation
forecast.
The blue area in these charts is a stylised illustration of the
impact that higher than expected import price pass-through
(100% pass-through versus 40% pass-through) has had on
inflation over the past two years. Changes in import prices
(ex food and fuels) are assumed to feed through to consumer
price inflation with a lag of one year. Assuming the import
intensity of the CPI basket is one third, an assumption of full
pass-though implies that a10pp rise in import prices leads to a
3.3pp rise in CPI inflation one year later. Assuming 40%
pass-through, a 10pp rise in import prices adds only 1.3pp to
inflation a year later.
The light green area in chart 3 illustrates the impact that the
recent rises in import prices (ex food and fuels) have had on
CPI inflation. It assumes that all of the increases in import
prices in 2010 have fed through to CPI inflation quickly with a
lag of just one quarter. The short lag reflects the fact that the
recent rise in import prices has been driven by commodity
prices. If we assume the import intensity of the CPI basket is
one third and pass-through is full, then a 1% rise in import
prices will lead to a 0.33pp rise in inflation 1 quarter later.
The dark green area in chart 3 shows the contribution from a
group of CPI components (listed below) relative to the
projections for those components consistent with the
judgements in the February 2009 Inflation Report. CPI
Components: Direct energy = Fuels & Lubricants +
Electricity, Gas & Other Fuels. Food = Food and NonAlcoholic Beverages.
