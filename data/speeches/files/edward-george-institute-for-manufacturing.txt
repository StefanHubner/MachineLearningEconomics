I am only too well aware of the pressure currently facing large
parts of the manufacturing sector of the economy and I welcome this
opportunity to explain the macro-economic context and say something
about the prospect.
Let me begin with the overall economic situation.

Since the trough of the last recession in 1992 – that’s 26 quarters
up to the third quarter of last year – total economic output in
this country has grown at an average annual rate of around 3%.
That is well above any plausible estimate of the underlying rate of
growth of capacity in the economy as a whole – which is typically
estimated at some 2-2½% - so that what we were in fact doing over
this period was steadily reabsorbing the economic slack created by
the earlier recession. In the labour market this was reflected in
a rise in employment of some 1.6mn to an all-time high of 26.5mn,
on the latest LFS figures. It was reflected, too, in a fall in the
rate of unemployment, from a peak of 10.6%, again on LFS figures,
to the current level of 6.2%, which is the lowest rate for about 20
years. These developments in the labour market produced a fairly
gradual pick up in pay settlements compared with past periods of
labour market tightening; and underlying retail price inflation –
measured by the Government’s target inflation measure, RPIX – has
averaged 2¾% a year through the expansion, and is currently
precisely on target at 2½%.
By around the beginning of 1997 it was becoming clear that overall
output growth needed to moderate if we were not to run up against
overall capacity constraints. In fact output growth actually
picked up during the course of 1997, from a rate of close to 3% to
around 4%, partly under the impact of the windfall effect of
building society demutualisation on consumer spending. Aggregate
demand growth, in other words, needed to slow if we were to avoid
overheating.
That essentially was the background to the tightening of monetary
policy during 1997.
But there was, of course, a major complication. In the autumn of
1996 sterling’s exchange rate against the core European currencies
started to strengthen, and by early 1997 it had already appreciated
by some 17% against the deutschemark. Although sterling
appreciated rather less against the dollar – which also
strengthened against the core European currencies over this period,
sterling’s effective exchange rate index (ERI) still rose by some
13.5%. Sterling went up further against the deutschemark right up
until the spring of last year.

2

It was never entirely clear just why sterling – and the dollar –
strengthened in this way – or more appropriately why the core
European currencies weakened – when they did.
It appeared to have little to do with relative monetary conditions
between the Anglo-Saxon countries and the Continent. It may have
had more to do with market perceptions – or market misperceptions –
about the future prospects for the euro. Financial markets
appeared at that time to take the view that European Monetary Union
was being driven increasingly by political determination – even if
that meant softening the interpretation of the economic convergence
criteria; that this implied a broad rather than a narrow initial
euro membership; and that that , in turn, implied a weak rather
than a strong euro.
But whatever the reason – and whether it was valid or not – the
effect of sterling’s appreciation was to introduce a pronounced
imbalance into the UK economy. It dampened net external demand,
and had a restraining exchange rate influence on cost and price
inflation, at a time when domestic demand growth remained
unsustainably strong, and when we were approaching full capacity.
On the one hand, we understood very well that, after a relatively
favourable exchange rate environment following our exit from the
ERM, the abrupt appreciation meant that the internationally-exposed
sectors of the economy, including large parts of manufacturing
industry, were now suddenly confronted with much harsher trading
conditions. That, as I say, had a dampening effect on the UK
economy. But we couldn’t just rely on that to cool the economy for
us. Clearly at some point the exchange rate would stop
appreciating, and this external dampening effect would have worked
its way through. In the meantime, we needed to slow the rate of
growth of domestic demand sufficiently to avoid overheating in the
economy as a whole. The strong exchange rate gave us somewhat more
time than otherwise to bring about the domestic slowdown – it meant
that monetary policy did not need to be tightened as much as would
have been necessary otherwise. But we could not avoid tightening
policy altogether – even though we realised that this would be
likely to increase the pressures on the internationally-exposed
sectors, because in anything other than the short term that would
have put the whole economy – including the internationally-exposed
sectors we were trying to shelter – at risk of accelerating
inflation. And I would remind you that right up until the spring
of last year we were seeing signs of increasing pressures in the
labour market even in the manufacturing sector – reflected in
increasing skills shortages and recruitment difficulties as well as
pay pressures. The uncomfortable reality, as I’ve said very often
before, is that monetary policy can only target the economy as a
whole – it can’t seek to protect individual firms or sectors, or
regions, however much we might wish it otherwise. That – as I’ve
discovered – is not exactly a popular idea, but there’s no question
that it is the reality of it.

3

Over the past year the world – and I mean the world – has changed
very substantially.
In point of fact, the strong exchange rate against Continental
Europe – whatever effect it had on margins and profitability, and I
don’t underestimate that – had puzzingly little effect on our trade
with the rest of the EU. And goods trade volumes – both exports
and imports - to the rest of the EU have in fact continued to grow
fairly steadily over the past two years.
But, of course, over the past year or so the internationallyexposed sectors of the economy have been dealt the further massive
blow of global economic slowdown. This started with financial
turmoil in Asia in the latter half of 1997, but even as late as
last summer it was possible to argue that it would have limited
impact on the overall world economy. In May, for example, the IMF
was still looking for world economic output growth of over 3% in
1998 and over 3¾% in 1999. That certainly was a slowdown compared
with average expected growth of around 4¼% only six months earlier
– but it was not catastrophic.
Through last summer though it became increasingly clear that things
would be much worse than that. The financial collapse in Russia,
deepening recession in Japan, and increasing nervousness about the
situation in Brazil, coupled with fears of the possible knock-on
effects on major industrial countries’ financial markets and hence
on their economies, all created a sense of panic by around the time
of the IMF annual meeting such as I’ve rarely experienced – and
don’t much wish to experience again!
The mood has improved since that low point. Financial markets have
recovered much of their nerve – helped by monetary policy easing in
the US and Europe; the Yen has appreciated easing some of the
pressures on the rest of the Asian region; the IMF has organised
support for Brazil and seen its resources substantially
replenished. Even so, the forecasts of world economic activity
continue to be revised downwards, so that the IMF’s latest
(December) forecast for world growth in 1998 and 1999 has been cut
to under 2¼% - barely half the trend rate. And the risks probably
remain on the downside.
We are still not talking, in these forecasts, about global downturn
or recession – though that is exactly what we are seeing in a large
part of the world economy. The expectation is that the US and
Europe will sustain domestic demand to accommodate the flood of
goods imports from the rest of the world which is necessary if the
suffering economies, now facing substantially reduced capital
inflows, are to see any kind of recovery. That means a prospective
imbalance between domestic and external demand in the industrial
world as a whole, which is somewhat similar to that which we were
already seeing in this country – but on a mega scale. In the UK
there has been a sharp deterioration in the overall balance of
trade in goods, to a deficit of -£18.3bn in the past four quarters

4

– about a 50% increase on what went before. This deterioration was
almost entirely with countries other than the EU and North America.
This picture has been mirrored in the US, where the deficit on
trade in goods has risen to around $65bn (3% of GDP). And this
picture of a weakening trade balance in goods is reflected in
falling manufacturing employment in both the UK and US.
In Continental Europe the trade picture looks rather better at
first sight, but that really reflects the fact that these economies
are at a different point in the cycle. But, here too, the outlook
is not particularly promising; in Germany, for instance, downwards
revisions to growth forecasts have reflected a sharp fall in the
forward looking survey measures of export expectations in the
manufacturing sector.
So the pressures on manufacturing are not confined to this country
– cold comfort though that may be.
This global economic slowdown represents, as I say, a further blow
to the internationally-exposed sectors of the UK economy,
particularly the commodity and goods-producing sectors. Even
though the strength of sterling has tended to ease since last
spring as the euro became a reality, what this means for us is that
external demand will be even weaker – and remain weaker for longer
– than we’d previously expected, and that there will be a further
dampening effect on inflation from weak world prices. So we have
even more time than before to bring about the domestic slowdown –
in fact we could afford for the time being to act to sustain
domestic demand. So the worsening global economic situation, and
the related further weakness of external demand that became
apparent through last summer, pointed to an easing of our monetary
policy stance.
But it was not the only factor. Domestic demand, too, particularly
consumer goods spending, also weakened more sharply in the latter
part of last year than we expected, for reasons that we do not
fully understand. Continuing growth of employment, and higher pay
settlements than last year, suggested that labour income was also
continuing to increase – and after a wobble in the autumn,
financial asset prices remained buoyant. At the same time consumer
borrowing and the growth of households’ money holdings remained
fairly robust. So it’s not easy to explain the sudden drop in
consumer confidence reflected in retail spending – and not easy to
predict how long it will in fact last. In any event, given the
further weakening of external demand we surely didn’t need such a
sharp, simultaneous, slowdown in domestic demand, so the evident
weakness of consumer spending, too, pointed to an easing of policy.
The arguments were not in fact entirely one way – they rarely are.
The imbalance in the economy remained a major complication with the
much larger services sector holding up much better than
manufacturing, and this dichotomy was neatly reflected in the fact
that while overall inflation was on track – at 2½% - this outcome

5

included 3½% inflation of services prices and only just over 1%
inflation of goods prices. There has been a similar divergence
between services and goods price inflation for some time now in all
the major economies. Moreover, the UK labour market remained
tight, although there have recently been some tentative – but not
conclusive – signs that it may now be beginning to ease. We have,
of course, been unsighted for some months as to what this has meant
for average earnings in the economy.
But taken altogether the evidence was becoming pretty clear through
the summer that we were seeing the slowdown in the economy as a
whole that we needed to see to keep inflation in line with the
target. And as we moved through the autumn the downside shocks to
the world economy – and to consumer spending in this country meant that we were at risk of undershooting the inflation target.
And that explains why we have moved quite aggressively to reduce
interest rates over the past few months.
So that’s where we are.
from here.
There is no doubt
overall economy –
choice was always
- deceleration or

What you’d like to know is where we go

that we are currently seeing a slowdown in the
as I say, a necessary slowdown. The effective
between an earlier – and hopefully more moderate
a later, but almost certainly sharper, decline.

The issue is about the extent – and the duration – of the slowdown,
which is much more difficult to assess. In fact, given the
uncertainties about the global economic situation, and given the
extent of the imbalance between the different sectors of the
domestic economy, that assessment is about as difficult as at any
time that I can remember. Of course there are plenty of people who
claim to know with great confidence – and who put their money, or
their mouth, on more extreme possible outcomes. And it’s true that
outside bets do sometimes win.
Our own approach is to attach varying degrees of probability to
alternative possible outcomes, which we reflect in our quarterly
Inflation Report. I can’t predict what our next Inflation Report –
which we publish next month – will in fact show, but frankly I’d be
surprised if our central projection were to suggest that the
economy as a whole was falling into steep or protracted recession.
But I can repeat to you the assurance that I have given elsewhere –
which is that we will respond symmetrically to the prospect as we
see it. If, on the balance of risks, we see a probability that
inflation will undershoot the Government’s target we will not
hesitate to ease policy further just as we moved to tighten policy
when the risks to inflation were in the other direction.
That is in fact what we have been doing, and it should provide some
reassurance to you. But there is not a lot more that we can do
directly – through monetary policy – to affect the current global
economic weakness which is adversely affecting the prospect for

6

manufacturing both in this country and more generally in the
industrial world. It remains the case that, if we were tempted to
go further in easing monetary policy and take significant risks
with inflation on the upside, we would be likely simply to make
matters worse for you in anything but the short term.
I hope that I have provoked you to a lively discussion!
