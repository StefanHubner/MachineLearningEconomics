Introduction

This morning, the ONS released its latest Labour Force Survey data, which showed that unemployment fell,
in the three months to November, to 7.1%. In recent months, the unemployment data have been increasingly
scrutinised, not least in the context of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)’s current forward guidance,
which binds us not to reduce monetary stimulus until unemployment falls to at least 7%, as long as the
Bank of England’s inflation and financial stability objectives are not put at risk.

As we approach the 7% threshold, I am sure speculation is bound to increase about what we might do when
the threshold is reached. Once we get there, we will say more, but for now, let me reiterate what we said in
the Minutes of our January meeting, also published this morning.

Alongside the recovery in the economy and that fall in unemployment, we have also seen a reduction in the
rate of inflation, to 2%, and cost pressures remain subdued. It is therefore worth restating that the 7%
unemployment level is only a threshold, not a trigger, and that the MPC sees no immediate need to increase
interest rates even if 7% were to be hit in the near future.

It is also the case that the recovery is still in its early stages, and the headwinds to growth linked to the
financial crisis are likely to persist for some time yet. So it is also likely that, when the time does come to
reduce the current degree of stimulus, it would be appropriate to do so only gradually. In terms of the
objectives of forward guidance, these two messages are important. One of the prime objectives of our
guidance strategy has been to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence for businesses and consumers to
help support the recovery, especially in its early stages.
That greater confidence and certainty is particularly important for the subject of my speech tonight – the
prospects for a pickup in business investment. Business investment is a crucial element in the recovery. It
does not just contribute to cyclical fluctuations in the economy; as the means by which the stock of capital
accumulates, it also influences the productive capacity of the economy and long-term trends in growth.

The UK economy has staged a remarkable upturn over the past year, but so far business investment has
remained weak, leading some commentators to judge that we are seeing the “wrong sort” of growth – too
much reliance on consumption and housing, not enough on investment and exports, is what I hear
frequently. Many seem puzzled by the fact that business investment has yet to pick up, as if this represents a
major fault in the recovery process.
Today I would like to dispel the misconception that business investment drives economic recoveries – that it
leads the economic cycle. Rather, as I will argue, its rightful place in the recovery is as a lagging, or late
cycle, contributor to growth. In other words, a broad-based recovery in activity – which must mean a recovery
in household spending, which accounts for 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) – is a prerequisite for a

recovery in business investment, not the other way round. I will also argue that, in this upswing, there are
good reasons why the investment recovery might take a little longer to get going than in other, more normal,
cycles.

None of this is to belittle the importance of business investment to growth: a recovery in business investment
is a precondition for a sustained wider recovery. The pace of the pickup in investment – when it comes – will
ultimately determine the duration of the present upswing. But to criticise the business sector for not having
increased its investment already, after only three quarters of respectable growth in the economy, seems to
me premature, and misguided.

What exactly does business investment encompass? Over the past thirty years, we have seen a wholesale
restructuring of the UK economy, away from manufacturing towards service activities, and this significantly
changes the way we need to think about business investment and its contribution to the economy.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), business investment accounts for about eight percent of
GDP and consists of spending on machinery and plant, transport equipment, commercial property and
software. Yet it is important to recognise that other types of spending, which you and I might think of as
business investment in a modern economy, are not treated as such in the national accounts. For example,
spending by companies on business services, such as advertising, falls under the category of intermediate
consumption, and the contribution of such spending to final demand (what is captured in GDP) primarily
shows up as household consumption and exports rather than investment. Some consulting services appear
as investment, but others are recorded as final consumption. And spending on Research and Development
(R&D) has been treated as intermediate consumption in the national accounts, rather than as business
investment. So it is welcome news that in the next Blue Book, to be published later this year, the ONS will for
the first time record R&D as investment spending, allowing it to contribute directly to GDP. It is also worth
pointing out that spending on intangible assets, an increasingly important part of companies’ capital
expenditure which is included in the official definition of business investment, is believed to be
under-recorded in the national accounts.

1

Even after setting aside these measurement issues, business investment remains one of the most difficult
output components to analyse and forecast. Ten years at the Confederation of British Industry taught me that
investment models based on profit maximisation and the cost of capital only explain a small part of
investment dynamics. Of course investment decisions will be affected by expected profits, marginal tax rates,
the relative price of investment goods, the cost (and availability) of external funding, and internal funds. But I
believe that neoclassical-type models miss an important factor, which has played a substantial role in driving

1

One partial explanation for the weakness of productivity advanced by Goodridge et al (2013) is that the increase in intangibles
investment since the financial crisis has been under-recorded and has not been matched by a commensurate increase in value added.
More generally, the mis-measurement of intangible investment is primarily a supply issue, since it implies that the stock of capital is
higher than estimated.

the current investment cycle – uncertainty. Changes in uncertainty and ‘animal spirits’ are a critical
determinant of how businesses themselves think and behave, and, more importantly, provide a better
understanding of the likely outlook for investment.

Recent developments in business investment

Business investment fell sharply during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, to a level some 30% below its
pre-crisis peak by late 2009, according to the latest ONS estimates. Even based on the previous vintage of
ONS data (“pre Blue Book” for those in the know), which are much less volatile, the peak-to-trough gap was
estimated to have been about 23%, bigger than that seen in the early 1980s and 1990s recessions
(Chart 1). Since the trough, business investment has remained depressed, with the level in the third quarter
of last year still about 26% below its pre-recession peak, considerably weaker than at the same stage in
previous cycles – although, again, differences with previous recessions are exacerbated by the volatility of
this vintage of the data.

Early data estimates are, of course, tentative, and I suspect some of that weakness in 2013 will be revised
away, but the narrative remains one of a collapse in business investment and only a feeble recovery to date.

So why has business investment been so weak? To answer that question and get a handle on what the
recovery might look like, we need to look at what happened during the crisis and its aftermath.
The financial crisis of 2008-2009 is best characterised as a large negative demand shock – a shock to the
level of activity. A number of factors have been identified as the root cause: the mispricing of risk, financial
3

innovation coupled with lax regulation and excessive leverage. Balance-sheet repair by households,
businesses and banks, together with fiscal consolidation, has weighed on activity here and in other
advanced economies in recent years. But it is the proximate triggers of the crisis that precipitated the
negative demand shock: the failure of several banks, and the associated seizing up of money and credit
markets, brought about a collapse of business and consumer confidence – so-called ‘animal spirits’ – and
with it private spending and world trade.
Yet it is not just the level of activity that was hit – firms, consumers and investors did not just become more
pessimistic about the future and cut down their spending. They also became much more uncertain about it,
facing a wider range of possible outcomes. The heightened degree of uncertainty caused by the banking
crisis was then compounded in 2011-12 by the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis within the Eurozone.
This combination of pessimism and heightened uncertainty represented a major shock to animal spirits,
causing companies and households to retrench sharply.

In practice, it can be difficult to distinguish between confidence and uncertainty. For example it is possible
that survey measures of uncertainty, such as the CBI’s question on factors limiting capital spending, which
includes a category on ‘uncertainty about demand’, capture firms’ lower average expectations about the
future state of the economy as well as the greater variance around these expectations. Purer proxies of
firms’ economic uncertainty, such as implied stock market volatility and the dispersion of company earnings
forecasts, also tend to move closely with shifts in confidence (Chart 2).

But that does not mean it is impossible to disentangle the respective effects of uncertainty and confidence on
economic activity. A recent empirical study for the UK shows that uncertainty shocks have a statistically
4

significant negative impact on GDP, even after controlling for confidence. And although uncertainty shocks
5

tend to be short-lived, the unprecedented size and duration of the increase in uncertainty during the
financial crisis, and the fact that it came in several waves, suggests that uncertainty is likely to have played a
significant role in depressing activity over the past five years. In other words, persistent uncertainty is likely to
have had a persistently depressing impact on output.

For business investment, the mechanism by which a rise in uncertainty operates is simple. Because
investment is costly to reverse, when a firm decides to undertake a project, it gives up the option of waiting to
gather more information. But that option has a value, which increases with the level of uncertainty about
6

future conditions. So to give up this “option to wait”, a firm will require a higher rate of return from
investment, net of costs, as compensation. In other words, uncertainty reduces the incentive to invest by
pushing up on the opportunity cost of undertaking an investment project. So it is not surprising that, in
business surveys, when firms are asked which factors are restraining capital spending, ‘uncertainty about
future demand’ is quoted by the greatest number of firms (Chart 3).
‘Animal spirits’ and reduced uncertainty as a prerequisite for an investment recovery

So, any recovery in business investment will require not only a pickup in final demand, but a sustained
decline in uncertainty. There are encouraging signs that this is now happening. Indicators of uncertainty
derived from stock-market volatility and company earnings forecasts have been gradually receding since late
2011, and the CBI’s measure of demand uncertainty had edged down markedly since the middle of last year
(Chart 2). Absent adverse developments in the euro area, uncertainty should continue to decline. Business
confidence too has been on the mend over the past couple of years, and the pickup in economic activity of
recent quarters should continue to support that improvement.

Indeed, investment intentions have picked up since late last year and paint a rather rosier picture of business
investment growth than the latest vintage of ONS data (Chart 4). These survey measures have in the past

been a close match for final estimates of business investment, so, as I said earlier, I suspect that in time the
official data will be revised up and align better with the surveys, to show that we are now in the very early
stages of an investment recovery.

The role of corporate finance: external vs internal

The second critical driver of corporate investment is financing conditions.

The credit crunch resulted in a sharp decline in finance raised by UK private non-financial companies
(PNFCs) (Chart 5), reflecting both lower demand for funds and constraints on the supply of bank lending.
With commercial banks, under pressure to repair their own balance sheets, less willing to extend loans, the
relative importance of corporate loans on UK PNFCs’ balance sheets has declined since the onset of the
recession (Chart 6).

This dearth of bank lending has no doubt been a factor holding back business investment. But the
relationship between bank financing and investment is more subtle than the aggregate numbers suggest.
Different firms tend to rely on different forms of finance, so the link between bank finance and business
investment may not be as direct as sometimes perceived.

Some firms have turned to alternative sources of finance, raising funds from public markets. Annual gross
bond issuance by UK PNFCs rose to its highest level since the data was first collected in the 1980s, as firms
8

benefitted from strong investor appetite for higher yields in a low interest rate environment (Chart 7). And
over the last five years, an estimate of the proportion of UK companies issuing a bond for the first time has
increased sharply compared to the five years prior to the crisis (Chart 8). But such financing is restricted to
very large firms - almost all individual bond issues since 2009 have been greater than £50mn.

In terms of their contribution to investment, the large firm sector (including both public and private
9

companies) is particularly important, contributing around 65% to net capital expenditure , and for these firms
there are encouraging signs. Intelligence from market contacts suggests that debt market conditions are
improving, such that firms are increasingly raising debt capital in order to refinance at a lower cost of funding
or build up cash reserves to take advantage of future investment opportunities, rather than simply because
they need to a fill a funding hole. This may point to an increased ability to invest.

At the other end of the scale, the very smallest businesses have only limited recourse to bank finance.
About half of firms with fewer than 50 employees do not use mainstream external corporate financing and, of

those that do, around a fifth have an overdraft, loan or credit card in their own name. As a result, they will
have been less directly affected by the reduction in corporate bank lending since 2009.

In the middle are the majority of firms, small and mid-size, which are more reliant on banks. These have
clearly been externally financially constrained through the crisis. So it is welcome that, for smaller firms,
conditions now seem to be improving, although this improvement is less clear for medium-sized firms
(Chart 9). But while these firms have faced the biggest deterioration in their access to external finance, they
are also the category that finances investment most heavily from internal funds.

Internal funds, generated through retained earnings, are an important, and often overlooked, source of
funding for investment for all firms. A simple accounting of ONS net financing flows over the past ten years
shows that long-term funding raised by UK PNFCs from external sources has not been sufficient to fund
11

aggregate business investment. While the exact matching of sources and uses of financing is uncertain,
this seems to imply that, in an average year, firms have relied on internal funds for at least 60% of UK
business investment, particularly so following the crisis (Chart 10). And, in my experience from talking to
businesses, these retained funds are likely to be even more important for those firms with limited sources of
external finance. Evidence from micro data on listed firms supports this – there is a strong correlation
between the cash profits and investing cash flows of these “middle-tier” firms without bond market access
(Chart 11). And over the last 20 years, the median listed firm without bond market access has on average
generated sufficient cash from its operations in an average year to cover more than 80% of its capital
expenditure.

The important role of retained earnings is consistent with the so-called pecking order theory of corporate
finance, where internal financing is preferred as it is cheaper than raising funds externally.

12

It is also

consistent with how companies appear to operate in practice. From my conversations with company finance
directors, it is apparent that most firms do not consider investment decisions in the way that economists
describe – that is that investment will be undertaken as soon as the marginal return exceeds the marginal
cost of capital, and that borrowing levels are subordinate to that. In practice, for most companies, the total
amount of external debt raised (the level of ‘gearing’) is strategically set at some pre-determined level –
trading off the benefits of extra debt with the risk of going insolvent – leaving investment decisions more
dependent on the amount of internal funds available.

10

SME Finance Monitor Q3 2013, BDRC Continental.
UK business investment will also include investment by financial intermediaries (not included in PNFC financing flows) although this
accounts for a very small portion of total business investment (around 5% in 2012).
12
According to the pecking order theory, external investors have less information about the firm than managers, and so demand an
external financing premium. Firms have a strict preference for internal funding, followed by debt and then equity. Equity is least
preferred as it would risk signalling to those outside the firm that such financing is cheap and the company is over-valued. See Majluf
and Myers (1984).

Pension deficits and investment

But since 2008, the availability of internal funds has been constrained by more than the normal cyclical
behaviour of profits. For many companies, pension deficits widened through the financial crisis as equity
markets fell, discount rates were reduced and estimates of pensioner longevity increased.

13

As a response,

many companies have had to increase their annual pension contribution, representing another call on
retained earnings. With gearing levels set, for many companies, independently, this has increased the
effective competition between investment and other uses for available internal funds.

Micro data show that listed firms which reported pension deficits have spent less on investment as a
proportion of their assets following the onset of the crisis, particularly in 2012 when deficits rose sharply
(Chart 12). And there is some evidence to suggest that for firms whose external financing is constrained, the
rise in pension deficits has weighed on investment by more than for firms with no deficit. This may be due to
the increased uncertainty that comes with having a pension deficit – raising questions around how much and
when a firm will have to pay to fill the gap. But it may also imply that having a pension deficit borne out of
changes in broad financial market conditions means that a firm has less retained earnings to finance capital
expenditure.

It is difficult to know with confidence which explanation is more binding. But in either case, the link between
pension deficits and investment seems to be important. This is confirmed by a recent survey of companies
with defined benefit pension schemes by the Bank’s Agents. Twenty-four percent of the firms surveyed, the
majority of which had a scheme in deficit, reported a major impact on investment decisions, with a further
28% reporting a minor impact.

In summary, access to external credit is clearly important in determining financing conditions for investment,
but I do not think it tells the full story. Bank loans remain an important source of finance for firms, for which
the Funding for Lending scheme is and will continue to play a significant part. But the role of retained funds
in financing investment should not be overlooked. The recovery in animal spirits should encourage firms to
dip into their retained profits to finance investment, supplementing the gradual improvement in external credit
conditions. And the recent rise in bond yields will be a welcome relief for those firms suffering under the
weight of pension deficits.

13

Some of the change in pension deficits will be due to QE, but this is likely to be small compared to other factors impacting on deficits
over this period, such as the collapse in equity prices at the start of the financial crisis. And QE will have benefitted the broader
corporate sector, by lowering the cost of finance, encouraging households to spend more and boosting confidence by removing some of
the worst downside risks. See Bean (2012) for a full discussion.

Anatomy of the business investment recovery
So conditions are falling in place to support a recovery in business investment – funding, both internal and
external, has become more readily available, uncertainty about future demand has fallen and confidence
about the economic outlook more generally has picked up. But while these conditions are all necessary for
companies to be able to invest, they are not in themselves fully sufficient for a recovery to get started.
The one-way nature of investment – once done it is difficult to undo – means in practice that there is a bias to
not investing. Put another way, businesses only invest when they feel compelled to do so – when they need
to replace an aging capital stock, expand their production capacity or keep up with competitors. So, even as
demand picks up and financing conditions improve, making the realisation of investment plans possible,
companies will in the first instance adopt a ‘make do and mend’ approach – stretching their capital utilisation
by repairing aging pieces of equipment, working their existing staff more effectively and so on – before
investing in new capital. This is an additional reason why business investment picks up several quarters after
whole-economy activity and the achievement of “normal capacity” working. Chart 13 shows that investment
today has the highest correlation with GDP one to two quarters ago, or, put another way, that GDP today
gives on average a reasonable indication of where business investment will be in the middle of the year (also
see Broadbent (2014)).

A further cross check on when capacity levels start to drive investment comes from the capital/output ratio.
Over the past twenty years, there appears to have been a steady decline in the ratio consistent with full
capacity working (Chart 14), as the capital intensity of the economy has fallen, probably as a result of the
growing importance of the service sector in GDP. The changing nature of investment in recent years
(towards shorter life assets) makes the choice of depreciation rate needed to estimate the current
capital/output ratio more uncertain, but at a reasonable depreciation rate it seems likely that the economy
should return to a capital/output ratio consistent with full capacity working over the course of the next
12-18 months. This should provide a further incentive for companies to invest, at least for replacement
purposes to offset further depreciation.

Survey evidence suggests that over the past three years, companies that have been investing have done so
mainly to replace equipment – and to a greater extent than usual – rather than to expand capacity
(Chart 15). That replacement motive for investment has been particularly prevalent in the services sector
(excluding financial services). This is consistent with the need to replace aging equipment, particularly in
vehicles and IT, as companies stretched out their rolling replacement programmes during the financial
crisis.

14

14

In the United Kingdom, no data exist on the average age of the capital stock, although the introduction of computer technology has
reduced the life length of some constituents of equipment capital, for example to five years for computers. See ONS (2010).

The need to replace existing assets continues to underpin investment plans, but companies are also
reporting that they intend to invest to expand capacity.

That chimes with the steer from survey measures of capacity utilisation. Survey responses suggest that
companies are now operating at normal capacity (shown by the position of the swathe relative to the zero
line in Chart 16). Analysis of answering practices to such surveys indicates that there is a subtle difference
between normal utilisation and absolutely full capacity,

15

suggesting that a modest increase in demand could

still be accommodated within existing fixed capacity. However, we now appear close to the point at which
additional investment will be required to cope with future increases in demand, explaining the reasonably
good leading relationship between survey measures of capacity utilisation and business investment
(Chart 17).

Another, more prosaic, factor will in due course encourage businesses to invest: the need to keep up with
competitors. As the recovery becomes more entrenched, finance directors will naturally become more
watchful of their rivals’ investment plans and market-share strategies, engaging in a virtuous circle of
matching their investment plans with that of competing firms.

Conclusion

The conditions needed for a recovery in business investment are finally falling in place. Confidence and
certainty about the economic outlook and consumer demand have improved, as has access to internal and
external sources of finance. This is laying the ground for businesses to start investing to replace obsolete
capital, increase existing capacity and keep up with competitors. Only then will investment take its rightful
place in the recovery, broadening final demand. I suspect that this may still be a little time in coming, and that
more rapid investment growth may not show through until later this year and into 2015 – as I said, business
investment is a late-cycle phenomenon. But it is worth the wait. Rising business investment should help
restore productivity growth amongst the labour force, leading to higher real wages and more sustainable
growth in consumption. That is the definition of a sustainable recovery, something to which we all aspire.

15

Analysis of the CBI Industrial Trend Survey shows that respondents deem normal capacity working to be around 90% of absolutely
full capacity.

quarter.
