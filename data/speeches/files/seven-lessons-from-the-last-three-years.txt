Introduction
As you know I am about to leave the Bank of England after three years as the Deputy
Governor responsible for its work on financial stability and as a member of the
Monetary Policy Committee.
It has been a game of two halves. The first 18 months from January 2006 to July 2007
were the tail end of the Great Stability, a period of nearly 15 years of continuous
growth, low inflation, and falling unemployment. They were guided by and reinforced
a wide consensus that economics had discovered the right way to manage the
economy and that the UK was a good model of how to put it into effect.
The second 18 months have seen an extraordinary reversal: with turmoil in financial
markets, the credit crunch, and the onset of a severe global recession calling into
question nearly every part of that consensus.
The immediate challenge is to limit the depth and duration of the recession and bring
the economy back onto a sustainable path with low but positive inflation. But we
have just set out our analysis of the economy in our February Inflation Report and
Charlie Bean explained the policy options we face in a speech earlier this week. So I
will focus today on some wider implications of the last few years for the way we
conduct economic and financial policy.
In doing so I am well aware that we are not yet at the end of the story. We don’t
know how deep and prolonged this recession will be or how soon and completely
financial markets will recover. So it is too early to reach settled conclusions on
causes or cures. So I offer this as an interim report : seven lessons I have drawn from
my experience of the last three years.
A settled consensus
But let me set out first the position as it appeared in 2006.
For much of my life, the design of economic policy has been at the centre of both
political and academic contention. In the UK, over the twenty years following the
breakdown of the Bretton Woods arrangements, we tried everything from prices and
incomes policies to several varieties of monetary targets and finally fixed exchange
rates and they all came to a sticky end. But the approach we adopted after our ejection
from the ERM was guided by modern monetary economics and set us on a course
which gathered growing support across the political spectrum and in markets.

Macroeconomic Policy
The new consensus was based in Britain on the experience of repeated bouts of
inflation and the three painful recessions which had been required to bring it under
control. That experience hammered home the lesson that there was no trade off
between inflation and growth. The best that macro policy could aim for was stable
and low inflation which would provide a platform for sustainable growth at a rate
which would be determined in large part by the microeconomic policies which could
affect the productivity and dynamism of the economy.
The right instrument to maintain that low inflation environment was monetary policy.
And to ensure that interest rates were used to that end, and thus to condition public
and market expectations, the decisions should be taken by an independent Central
Bank pursuing an explicit inflation target and informed by modern macroeconomics .
Fiscal policy
In macro terms, fiscal policy was put on auto pilot. Discretionary changes in the
government’s tax and spending plans were thought to require too much time to agree
and take their effect to be of any practical use in stabilising the economy. And
economists worried that fiscal measures would prove largely impotent in any case –
households and companies would ‘look through’ any cut in taxes today, which they
expected to be financed by an increase in taxes tomorrow.
So monetary and fiscal policy worked in tandem. Monetary policymakers relied on
the government to balance the books over the cycle so that the inflation target would
remain credible. And the government relied on monetary policymakers to stabilise
the economy, so that fiscal policy could focus on other aims: encouraging innovation,
growth and employment; redistributing income and investing in the public services.
A single regulator
Alongside this macro framework, there was a consensus that industry and commerce
was best left to the market with market failures and externalities controlled by
independent regulators, like OFGEM, OFCOM and OFWAT, rather than through
ownership. In the case of the financial services sector, responsibility was given to the
FSA and banking supervision moved out of the Bank. The new FSA inherited from
the Bank an approach to prudential supervision in particular which was based as far as
possible on principles rather than a detailed rule book .
There were positive and negative reasons for that move. The positive were that a
single financial regulator would be more effective at a time when the lines between
banking, insurance and securities dealing were breaking down. It was efficient for the
firms to have just one regulator to deal with and good for the regulator to be able to
look at all aspects of their business. On the negative side there was a worry that
responsibility for supervision even of banks could unbalance the Bank and distract it
from its monetary role. So while the Bank retained a role in promoting financial
3

stability and monitoring the vulnerabilities in the system as a whole, it was not given
any statutory objectives or powers in the new legislation.
This piece of the UK system was controversial in some quarters but it definitely
topped the international best buy tables in 2006. The IMF called it a model for others
and a succession of governments visited London to learn from it. The Chairman of the
FSA was invited by the US Treasury Secretary to address the heads of the US
regulatory bodies. And the Mayor of New York City and a US Senator commissioned
a report which concluded that the US needed to learn from London’s approach to
regulation if it was to arrest New York’s decline as a global financial centre. 1 In short
the separation of the three authorities, each with a clear remit and the independence
to pursue it, was seen as a good model for a modern economy (Chart 1)
Revisiting the Great Stability
And it worked! We should not underestimate the achievement of the next decade. As
recently as fifteen years ago, low and stable inflation still seemed an unattainable
goal. But, research published by the Bank around the time I joined found that:
‘the post-1992 inflation-targeting regime has been characterised, to
date, by the most stable macroeconomic environment in recorded UK
history’2
As Chart 2 shows, volatility of both output and inflation hit new lows. Similar gains
were achieved overseas, although the break in macroeconomic performance appears
to have happened earlier in the United States.
In the UK we did indeed avoid the sort of cyclical booms in output, income and
employment we had seen in the 70s ,80s and 90s (Chart 3). Even with the benefit of
hindsight, it is hard to demonstrate that the economy was running significantly above
capacity in the last few years. The flow of migrants eased capacity constraints in the
labour market and the surveys of capacity utilisation rang no alarm bells (Chart 4).
Indeed when I arrived on the MPC, some members were arguing that we needed to
cut rates again following a year in which unemployment had increased and house
prices appeared to have achieved the mythical “soft landing” after a relatively light
touch on the interest rate tiller.
And while the expansion of low cost producers in Asia had been a helpful
tailwind, the system seemed to have dealt with some big shocks, like the East
Asian Crisis and the bursting of the Dotcom bubble. So most commentators
concluded that a good policy framework had played its part.
The last 18 months have shown that the reduced volatility of growth and inflation did
not tell the whole story. There may not have been a boom in activity in the West but

there certainly was in many emerging markets . And rising savings there, channelled
a huge flow of funds into the world’s financial markets, depressing risk-free interest
rates. After the post-millennium collapse in the world’s stock markets this was
compounded by a coordinated loosening of monetary policy. Cheap money supported
an increase in leverage in the financial sector (Chart 5). And banks became
increasingly dependent on funding from wholesale markets rather than their
traditional deposit base. In the real economy, asset prices rose and household balance
sheets in particular became stretched .
Fast forward to the present day and the neat separation of powers and responsibilities
between policymakers has evaporated (Chart 6). Monetary policymakers are
beginning to explore unconventional tools to arrest the economic decline as nominal
interest rates approach the lower bound. Fiscal policy has returned as a major tool of
macroeconomic management as well as an essential support to the banking sector.
And the Bank and the Treasury have been drawn deeper into the financial stability
realm. A substantial share of the British banking system is now owned by the UK
taxpayer. .
Are these just temporary changes to deal with an exceptional crisis or were there some
more structural flaws in the original design and the consensus that underpinned it? I
would draw out seven lessons. (Chart 6)
Lesson 1 : The limitations of private-sector risk management
One weakness in the system was the failure of banks and many other investors to
appreciate, price and manage risk.3
It was not that banks were blind to the froth in financial markets. For example, we
published analyses of the vulnerabilities in our Financial Stability Reviews in 2006
and 2007 and highlighted the declining price of risk, the build up of global
imbalances, the growing dependence of banks on wholesale funding, and the risk that
structured credit markets could seize up in a downturn. When we took that message to
Chief Executives of banks in London and New York, they generally accepted the
analysis and agreed that a correction was bound to come. However, almost to a man
(and they were all men), they took comfort from the sophistication of their risk
management systems and hedging strategies. They were confident they could ride out
the storm.
But as it turned out their systems were preparing them for a shower not for a
hurricane. The limitations of their risk models were cruelly exposed in August 2007.
One CFO remarked last year ‘We were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation
moves, several days in a row’, which in plain English means that according to their
models, the outright impossible was happening on a daily basis. According to the
Value at Risk (VaR) benchmark for example – which measures the amount an

Director of Financial Stability at the Bank, in Why banks failed the stress test.

institution stands to lose on its portfolio given an abnormal movement in market
prices – there shouldn’t have been a big problem But that was partly because recent
experience grossly underestimated what the truly abnormal really was. Updating
these models to take account of the volatility in asset prices seen over the past 18
months suggests measured risk increases by a half and in some cases doubles (Chart
7).
Many of the models depended on relatively short runs of data – one year for
many, ten years at most. So the long period of stability reduced the projected
losses from a future downturn (Chart 8)
But the problem goes deeper than just choosing the right sample period to estimate
these VaR models. Using a longer back-run of data to re-classify August 2007 as an
extremely improbable 5 standard deviation event rather than an effectively impossible
25 standard deviation event rather misses the point. The longer the build up of
imbalances went on, and the larger they became, the smaller the chance that the
bubble could burst without a correction. The events of August 2007 were not a bolt
from the blue, an unpredictable random disaster, but the culmination of several years
of developments in financial markets
But inadequate models are not the only reason for being wary of putting too much
weight on risk management by individual firms. There is also the vital question of
incentives.
Chuck Prince, the ex-chief of Citi, has been widely condemned for saying : ‘as long
as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.’ But in a provocative way he
was doing little more than state the obvious. Firms are expected to maximise profits
and if they won’t seize the opportunities someone else will. Sit out the dance, and you
risk getting swallowed by a competitor.
In many ways the ideal risk management system for a single bank is one which lets it
dance until the music stops but then to get to the exits before its competitors - to take
the profits when they are available and to close out risks as near as possible to the
downturn (or even better profit from their competitors’ remaining exposures). It is
noticeable that the investment banks which did best in 2007 were not those which had
stepped back from the new markets well in advance but those which reacted most
quickly and cohesively when the trouble started in the summer of 07.
Of course other banks need to learn from their example and improve their own
information and control systems. But in a competition someone always has to come
last and what matters for the authorities is how much the weakest will be damaged
and how far that damage will spread through the system. What we saw in the autumn
was that even the most successful investment banks were put at risk by the failure of
the weaker ones.

6

So one lesson we have learned from this crisis is that we cannot leave risk
management to the banks. Not only may they get it wrong but their risk systems, like
their marketing, are directed at their competitive advantage and they are not
motivated or in a position to look after the system as a whole.
Lesson 2 : Establish more effective crisis management
As Adair Turner set out very clearly in his recent speech, the events of the last year
and a half have revealed a number of particular gaps in the international regulatory
regime. For example, it gave too little weight to off-balance sheet exposures – the
SIVs and conduits in the shadow banking system which were holding huge portfolios
of what turned out to be toxic assets. The risks of losses on trading books were
underestimated as were the risks in the growing dependence of many banks on brittle
wholesale funding markets. I am confident that the G20 summit will endorse a
practical set of measures agreed in the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel
Committee to tackle these points.
But we need also to beware of the dangers of over regulation. Some commentators
seem attracted to turning our banks into nationalised utilities. Certainly international
capital markets have complicated policy making but that is not a sufficient reason for
dismantling one of our most successful sectors. Moreover nationalisation has been
tried in many countries and its record is poor. It may reduce the risk of shocks but
generally only at a heavy cost in misallocation of resources (and usually a continuing
drain on the public purse). In my view it should only be a very last resort. The aim
of the game should be to manage the system so that society can enjoy the gains of a
flourishing financial sector – the efficient allocation of resources and transfer of risk –
whilst minimising the threats to economic stability. So we need to have effective
systems not just for preventing crises but for dealing with bank failures if and when
they happen.
The collapse of securitisation markets in August 2007 and the failure of Northern
Rock revealed gaps in the UK’s arrangements, With the benefit of hindsight, the main
problem was not the handling of the initial rescue – although the tripartite’s footwork
may have owed more to John Sergeant than Fred Astaire. But I don’t think anyone
believes now that the business could have been saved. It was in terminal difficulties
and it was right to rescue it and protect depositors. The bigger problem was that,
having stepped in, the authorities were hamstrung by the inadequacy of the legal
powers to resolve it quickly and cleanly.
We have learned from that autumn’s experience. Since then we have found
imaginative ways to provide the market with the liquidity it needs ( through the
Special Liquidity Scheme, long term repos, and now the discount window), we led the
world in recapitalising banks in the autumn and we have resolved the banks which
could not survive swiftly and effectively both through private sector solutions and
through the use of statutory measures

7

I am delighted that tomorrow the first parts of the new Banking Act come into effect
and give the Bank of England new powers to resolve failing banks and protect
depositors.
At the heart of the Act is the creation of a Special Resolution Regime for UK banks
and building societies. The FSA will have the power to trigger this regime before an
institution becomes insolvent. And once a bank is in the regime, the Bank will have
the powers to arrange for it to be wound up , drawing on a new bank-specific
insolvency-procedure, or to transfer the whole or part of the bank to a commercial
purchaser, if necessary via a temporary bridge bank owned by the Bank. If none of
these options is sufficient to protect financial stability, there will be the option of
temporary public sector ownership. In the course of the legislative process, we have
identified and enacted wide ranging protections for netting and set off and creditors
generally to ensure that no one is made worse off by the resolution than they would
have been if the bank had gone into a simple administration.
The Act also puts the Bank’s financial stability objective onto a statutory footing and
formalises the Bank’s role in overseeing those payment systems that are essential to
the smooth running of the economy.
Giving these responsibilities to the Bank is the right choice because they build on the
role the Bank already has as LOLR in crisis handling (which nearly always involves a
crisis of liquidity). More generally it provides a statutory basis for the Bank’s second
core purpose – financial stability – which was not mentioned in the 1998 Act and
appeared something of an orphan in the Bank when supervision moved to the FSA.
Over the last 18 months of course that has changed and the Bank is now closely
involved with the FSA in monitoring and intervening in banks and markets facing
stress, as well as reviewing the risks to financial stability more widely and playing a
role in forming international policy through bodies like the G 20 and the FSF.
In effect the Bank has become a second pair of eyes alongside the FSA watching the
health of the financial system. The FSA, as the regulator, is informed by “bottom up”
knowledge of the position of individual institutions ; the Bank is informed by a top
down view drawing on its own engagement in many markets and on its analysis of
the wider economy. We come together to monitor institutions when they become
vulnerable .
Some argue that we should go further and move prudential supervision – at least of
the main banks - back into the Bank. That would certainly be workable – we have
done something like it before – and there could be changes in the euro zone which
might add to the attractions of a move in that direction.
However, it is important not to underestimate the costs of the transition and the new
boundary issues it would create. The cultures and staffing of the Bank and the FSA
have changed a great deal since 1997 and would not be easy to reshape. And there are

8

genuine costs for firms and supervisors in split responsibilities for different parts of
complex groups.
Personally, I am not convinced there is a clearly superior arrangement to the revised
arrangements we have now put in place. It is not clear that any country has done much
better than the others despite the differences in regulatory structure. Perhaps Canada
has the best claim and that has a system similar in many respects to the UK’s.
Whatever the boundaries, in a crisis like today’s I am sure that cooperation between
the regulator, Central Bank, and Finance Ministry would be essential. I am pleased
therefore that the new legislation makes clear the duty of the Bank to cooperate with
the FSA and Treasury.
Lesson 3 : Tighten international coordination
If the tripartite arrangements at home needed to be improved, cross border
coordination needs to be transformed if we are to avoid a drift back into a network of
national and regional financial enclaves.
The failure of Lehmans was a fully fledged disaster for the world economy. And a
number of other cases, from the failure of the Icelandic banks to Fortis, Dexia and
IKB, have shown how difficult it is to manage failures of international banks .
Yet the fact is that most of the key players in the world’s financial markets have
developed into large and complex multinational firms.
Their business is not
separated into national units. Some core functions – such as risk-management and
liquidity management – will be centralised, and performed at the head-office.
Activity at each hub cannot be viewed in isolation: a multinational may raise deposits
in one country to fund loans in another. And the ultimate buffer against unexpected
losses – capital – is fluid across borders in pursuit of profit.
One response is to call for global regulators to deal with global institutions. That of
course means pooling national sovereignty over a key issue of economic policy. And
it could also require a global fiscal authority with deep pockets to whom the regulator
could turn should one of these institutions fall into distress. The task of persuading
the US and China to hand over the regulation of their largest banks to a supranational
regulator would make even the greatest diplomat quail.
Another conclusion is that such multinationals pose too great a risk to stability and
should be subject to greater control by host authorities in each jurisdiction with the
creation of separate pools of capital and liquidity in each country. But that retreat
from globalisation would also have a cost in inefficiency and restraints on the flows of
capital between countries. We should not forget that the last decade of free financial
markets has been a time of great progress across the developing world in Asia,
Eastern Europe and South America.

9

But the process of building up national controls is already underway in many
countries including even the UK which has long been one of the most open economies
for capital and ownership. It will continue unless we can convince each other that
much better structures for cooperation and coordination are in place. That is an acute
problem within the EU where the single market is based on a common passport. But
dealing with the European problem is not the main priority since most of the biggest
banks in the world are based elsewhere.
I don’t think we should give up on this international agenda. The package of
economic measures that were rolled out late last year – from coordinated cuts in
interest rates, to provision of dollar liquidity and measures to support banks – showed
the power and possibility of coordinated action. The programme of work on the
regulatory implications of the crisis which has been coordinated by the FSF and will
go in April to the G 20 Summit demonstrates a wide accord on the main regulatory
issues.
But we need more progress on implementation as well as policy. In particular we need
much stronger cross border crisis planning – a subject on which I have been chairing a
group under the FSF. This has been bedevilled, in practice, by the sheer lack of
information and time to consult widely in the heat of a crisis. That we can do
something about.
I hope we will agree two things to put to the G 20 summit – a statement of principles
on how countries should cooperate in planning for and handling crises in cross border
institutions and a programme to put in place better arrangements for information
sharing and cross border dialogue on the largest banks in the world. Building on the
core international colleges of supervisors we would aim in peacetime to establish a
shared information base among the relevant authorities and jointly to think through
the implications of failure for different countries. That would at least give us the basis
for considering a coordinated solution in wartime. In time we should also try to
establish greater harmony on national resolution regimes which is on the Basel
Committee’s agenda.
Lesson 4 : Develop a new generation of macroeconomic models
So far I have concentrated on lessons for financial policy but this recession has also
set some challenges for the economics profession and cast doubts on the
macroeconomic modelling.
In truth, much of my critique of the models that financial institutions use to calibrate
risk could equally be levelled at the workhorse DSGE models that most economists
and central bankers use to describe and forecast macroeconomic developments.
These have a number of attractive features. It is built on sound economic principles
of forward-looking optimising agents, which is useful for carrying out academic
though experiments. Unfortunately, such models also have some big drawbacks.

10

First, having introduced uncertainty into the picture by making agents forward
looking, they then assume the problem away. Risk doesn’t matter: agents are assumed
to make decisions today based on the path they believe the economy will take in the
future, not the full range of possible paths it might take. And those beliefs about the
future are based on absolute faith in the ability of the policymaker to stabilise inflation
and the economy over the medium term. They therefore beg some important questions
for policy makers – how do we sustain and build confidence in our policy and what
happens if it falters?
Second these models generally assume that the path of the economy is one of
equilibrium disturbed by a sequence of more or less random shocks to which it
responds in short order to return to the equilibrium path. For economists using these
models a critical question is always what shocks have led to the starting position i.e.
how far from equilibrium are we and for what reason. Those starting assumptions will
then condition the path back to trend growth and target inflation over the medium
term.
In truth, these “shocks” reflect not only events and surprises in the real world but the
limitations of the model itself. In particular, the models cannot deal easily with self
reinforcing movements away from equilibrium. What at first glance can look like a
series of unrelated unexplained disturbances to the variables in the model, could
actually reflect some common economic impulse that is not captured by the model.
Whether those shocks die away, persist or even build – and therefore how misleading
the forecasts that the model produces are – will depend on what’s missing from the
model.
In fact the areas of the economy which the current generation of models do not cover
well include the areas where the imbalances were building up in recent years. The
treatment of financial markets and their interaction with the real economy is little
more than a side-show. Banks are typically absent altogether. Yet experience has
shown that financial markets are particularly prone to these self-reinforcing
movements away from equilibrium. We have seen in the last few months alone many
examples of that. For example we have seen coordinated sales of assets depressing
prices, leading to write-downs on portfolios throughout the system, which in turn have
triggered a further wave of selling.
These features generally prevented these models from ‘joining up the dots’ in the last
upswing and from capturing the impact of tightening credit conditions in the
downswing.
I should emphasise that the MPC is not a slave to any one model. The current
Governor reminds us frequently that :

11

‘It is vital never to confuse the world with a model. The whole point of
a model is to abstract from a wider range of factors in order to think
clearly about one particular issue.’4
Over the last couple of years, for example, we have drawn on a range of models to
capture the impact of credit markets. The MPC bases its forecasts on all the evidence.
And most forecasts have a lot of added judgement in them. But our main macro model
sets a baseline for our discussions and forces us to quantify and integrate different
judgements . It is difficult to see how the committee could reach a consensus on a
forecast (albeit with a probability distribution around the central projection) without a
model of some sort.
All models are simplifications and all models have difficulty identifying turning
points. But we badly need some new thinking to make them better. Putting banks
into the models would be a good place to start. The model of the banking sector which
is being developed in the Financial Stability wing of the Bank will make a good
contribution to that.
Lesson 5 : Mopping up after the bust is not a good strategy
The world’s central banks have tended to follow similar strategies. So much so that
an American economist, John Taylor, was able to neatly summarise how monetary
policy is set with a very simple rule. He found that movements in interest rates
around their long-run level could be explained by just the level of inflation relative to
its target, and imbalances between the level of demand in the economy and the
capacity of the economy to produce output.
Asset prices and stock imbalances of the kind we have seen on the balance sheets of
banks, households and companies are conspicuous by their absence in the Taylor
Rule. Whether policymakers actually slavishly follow the Taylor Rule, or it simply
represents a good description of how we behave is largely immaterial. Either way, the
default position of policymakers has been that interest rates should not be used to
choke off a boom in financial markets. That non-interventionist doctrine was based
on two key judgements.
First, that the costs of leaning against imbalances in financial markets were high. It
was believed that policymakers would find it difficult to differentiate between
movements in asset prices that could be justified by fundamentals and those which
reflected bubbles. The central bank which frequently responded to movements in
asset prices would often as not be doing so mistakenly. By the time that the central
bank was confident that asset prices were unsustainable it would typically be too late
to act. An increase in interest rates late in the day could prove counter-productive: the
bubble might well have burst by the time the change in policy had filtered into
aggregate demand. Even when an imbalance could be identified early enough to do
4

12

something about it, the increase in interest rates required to choke off the imbalance
would have serious side-effects.
Much of this will be familiar to all policymakers, no matter what field they work in.
It is a ‘counsel of despair’. Understanding how developments in financial markets
pose risks to the system and the wider economy is a formidable task. But it is one we
should embrace, rather than shy away from. It is the final leg of the argument that is
key: how much higher would interest rates have had to have been in order to have
contain the boom in financial markets.
Some commentators have made much of the Bank’s decision to cut interest rates by
25 basis points in the summer of 2005. But to pretend that all this could have been
avoided had interest rates been 25 basis points higher over the last couple of years
seems to me pure wishful thinking. Likewise, the idea that had rates been a little
higher at the tail-end of the boom in late 2006 and early 2007 the crash could have
been averted is a flight of fancy.
Interest rates would have had to have been significantly higher for an extended period
of time, perhaps as far back as 2002/3. Growth would have been weaker. Inflation
would have undershot the target by even more than it did. Sterling would likely have
risen, putting our export sector under particular strain. Which leaves us with the
question: is that a price worth paying in order to avoid the fall-out when a bubble
eventually bursts? And that leads us to the second judgement that underpinned the
non-intervention doctrine.
Prior to the latest crisis at least, many policymakers believed that the costs of allowing
a bubble in financial markets to run its course were relatively small. Interest rates
could always be cut after the event to ‘mop up’ the damage. Blinder and Reis
summarise the received wisdom beautifully in their review of the decision to loosen
policy when the DotCom bubble burst:
‘If the mopping up strategy worked this well after the mega-bubble
burst in 2000, shouldn’t we assume that it will also work well after
other, presumably smaller, bubbles burst in the future?’
The large and coordinated cut in interest rates at the start of this decade almost
certainly contributed to the build-up of an ever larger bubble. So its not at all clear
that the post-2000 mopping up strategy worked that well in retrospect – it just stored
up more trouble for the future. And even if it did work well last time around, I hardly
need to add that mopping up the fall-out from the latest crisis is stretching the world’s
policymakers to the limit. It is evidently not safe to rely on being able to mop up after
the crash.
Lesson 6 : Inflation targeting is necessary but not sufficient
A more fundamental question is whether the Inflation Targeting regime itself needs to
be re-thought.
13

Some argue that the framework imposed a straightjacket on central banks including
ours by setting too narrow a remit. Interest rates could only be changed when there
was a clear and present danger to the near-term outlook for consumer inflation. So
they could not be used to prevent imbalances building up. Action was almost bound to
be too late.
This critique takes an unduly narrow interpretation of the framework. There is
nothing in the MPC’s remit which would prevent us from consciously allowing
inflation to undershoot the target for some time, in order to avoid a significant
overshoot at some point in the future. Or as my fellow Deputy Governor Charlie
Bean put it:
‘a central bank seeking to stabilize inflation and output over a
sufficiently long time horizon, should necessarily aim to incorporate the
possible adverse long-term consequences of an asset price bubble in its
deliberations’
Intelligent inflation targeting on these lines run by independent central banks still
seems to me the best foundation for macroeconomic policy. But that does not mean
the current framework or the way we explain it is perfect.
First a point on communication. Inflation targeting was designed not just to control
inflation but as the best policy framework for promoting wider economic prosperity
and stability. It is crucial in a period of economic hardship – with companies going to
the wall and people losing their jobs – that people do not think the Bank is focused on
a narrow inflation target for its own sake. If they feel that we are not accepting
responsibility for what happens to growth and jobs, they will look for someone else to
do so. If we want to preserve the framework we have a job on our hands – now more
than ever – to explain our strategy to the general public. The Bank and MPC need to
convince them that the policy we are pursuing is the best way of restoring growth and
full employment without reawakening inflation. Indeed it is by bringing output back
to potential that we will bring inflation back to target.
Secondly, I share the view that setting a target for a measure of consumer price
inflation which excludes the costs of home ownership has done us no favours. It is
widely recognised as a flaw in the harmonised CPI across Europe but it is of
particular significance in the UK given the critical role that home ownership plays
here in household budgets and wealth. Something needs to be done to remedy that
situation, and if progress can’t be achieved at a European level I think we ought to
consider going it alone.
More fundamentally, if inflation targeting by an independent central bank is an
essential foundation of policy ,it is pretty clearly not sufficient on its own. We are

14

now learning a lesson that Japan learned a decade ago. As the Governor of the Bank
of Japan recently remarked5
‘if inflation targeting regimes induce market participants to think of
monetary policy decision-making process in terms of an inflation
number, they tend to overlook the insidious build-up of unsustainable
imbalances…. Inflation targeting works well if it is properly
understood.. (but this) can be difficult once an economy has attained
and maintained a low inflation rate for a number of years.”
This is partly a matter of adopting the intelligent approach inflation targeting. We
must be willing to “lean against the wind” of asset price booms and credit expansion
and to tolerate somewhat weaker growth and lower employment in doing so.
But if we need to prevent asset price and credit booms as well as control consumer
prices it would be better to have two instruments than one and that is the last lesson I
want to discuss – the need to develop instruments which directly dampen the cycle of
credit growth and asset prices.
Lesson 7 : We need another instrument to stabilise the economy
The first step must be to decide how ambitious we want to be and define the
objective. Then we can design the instruments. I don’t think we have all the answers
yet. But the outlines of a scheme are beginning to emerge in the academic literature –
not least in an impressive recent report by Charles Goodhart of this parish and friends
– and they are being taken up vigorously ( especially by the British members ) of the
FSF and G 20.
Preventing the regulatory system from exacerbating the cycle
A minimum step is to remove as far as possible features of the regulatory system
which exacerbate the cycle. This is not as easy as it sounds. Both accounting rules on
provisions and regulatory capital requirements are based on estimated probabilities of
default and estimates of losses given default. Both of these tend to rise sharply when
an economy turns down, arrears mount and the value of collateral declines. So as
trading conditions tighten, capital requirements are raised.
The FSA announced last month a series of measures which seek to address that pro
cyclicality by basing their capital requirements on average loss rates through the cycle
rather than on estimates of loss which vary through the cycle. A similar approach is
being ironed out internationally in the Basel Committee and FSF.

Protecting the banks from the cycle
A more ambitious goal would be to use the regulatory system to dampen the impact of
the economic cycle on banks and other financial institutions – to protect the banks
from the cycle.
The Spanish system of dynamic provisioning is an example of this approach. This is
based on the observable facts that arrears and defaults tend to emerge in downturns
and that loans written at the top of the cycle tend to have higher losses. Banks are
required therefore to set aside a general provision against likely future loss each time
they write a loan on the basis of a formula which is sensitive to the cycle. This is an
accounting provision so these provisions are deducted from profits when they are
made, and reduce dividends and profit related bonuses. They are then drawn down
automatically as losses appear. In effect this requires banks to build up reserves in the
upswing of a cycle which can cushion their losses in the downswing. The system has
not prevented a property boom and bust in Spain but it has put their banks in a much
stronger position to survive it by calling on these general provisions which amounted
to over 1% of total assets.
And in the process of protecting the banks from the cycle, this system has helped to
some degree to dampen the cycle itself. Varying capital regulations in this way can
act as a brake on the exuberant swings in lending we have seen in recent years. By
requiring banks to hoard capital in the upswing, regulators make it more expensive for
banks to lend money. And by dampening the credit cycle policy could help stabilise
spending in the real economy.
Protecting the cycle from the banks
In my view there is a case for taking this further and adopting the more ambitious goal
to use regulatory requirements to smooth out the credit cycle . In other words,
preventing the imbalances within financial markets destabilising the real economy.
This would involve varying the regulatory requirements to stabilise the supply of
credit and the terms on which it was granted – for example by requiring banks to hold
more capital when they would otherwise be loosening credit conditions, and allowing
banks to run down capital when they would otherwise by restricting access to credit.
This approach could offset to some degree not just a domestic credit cycle but the
impact of developments elsewhere in the global economy which affect the terms on
which banks are able to raise funds in financial markets or the he value of their assets.
To a limited degree this would allow the authorities to make the banking system a
shock absorber. Policymakers would be raising capital requirements to preventing
shocks that occur outside the banking system from destabilising the real economy.
But I would limit the goal to smoothing the credit cycle and would not be inclined to
go further and use it as a general stabiliser of the economy.

16

Weapons in the arsenal
So what is the choice of instruments?
I see great attractions in “dynamic provisioning”, in other words amending the
accounting system to recognise likely future losses. That seems to produce a better
guide to the real financial strength of banks and to be properly conservative in not
recognising profit before it is earned. I am aware that this runs counter to a powerful
school of accounting theology but I have been encouraged by proposals circulated
recently by Paul Boyle at the FRC for cyclical reserving and I hope that will be
pursued.
An alternative approach would be to vary regulatory capital floors with the cycle and
require banks to hold undistributed reserves in the upswing which could be drawn on
in the downswing. This is a second best because the reserves are taken after profit is
struck, with all the signals that sends investors and staff. But it could have much the
same effect as dynamic provisioning and may be capable of implementation rather
earlier.
But capital requirements are not the only approach. Counter cyclical limits could be
introduced on the liquidity position of a bank. For example, banks might be required
to invest a varying proportion of their assets in a war-chest of government bonds and
highly liquid assets. Or they could face varying constraints on the extent to which
they are allowed to tap short-term wholesale funds
Finally we could introduce restraints on the terms on which banks can lend money to
households and companies. Loan to income and loan to value ratios tend to rise in
any credit boom as lending standards become lax and asset prices inflate. In theory, a
ceiling on these ratios could have provided an effective brake on the excesses of the
last boom. While this has obvious microeconomic disadvantages, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority showed how such an approach could work in practice in the
1990s: tightening the constraint on loan-to-value ratios as their property market
threatened to overheat.
Another possibility would be compulsory margin
requirements on trading positions.
I am clear that counter cyclical capital requirements are a large part of the answer but
I would be inclined to keep a number of other options open too. Having a large
arsenal of policy instruments, which vary in their point of influence provides some
welcome flexibility. It allows the policymaker to respond appropriately to a particular
situation, rather than treating all shocks the same. For example, if problems are
concentrated within the property market then caps on loan-to-income and loan-tovalue ratios might be effective. If instead the problem lay in funding markets, with an
unwarranted compression in risk premia, then the instruments of liquidity regulation
would be more appropriate.

17

Who calls the shots?
That leads on to the issue of who should have control over these policy instruments?
The answer I think very much depends on the objective of policy and the way in
which policy is set.
Clearly the application of the policy would be for the regulator. If policy is given the
narrower goal of protecting the banks from the cycle and it proves possible to set clear
rules in place (for example a simple leverage ratio) there would be no need for a
further policy maker to be involved.
However if policy is given the broader macroeconomic goals of stabilising credit –
protecting the cycle from banks if you will – and judgement is required on the state
of the cycle and whether and when to vary the rules ,then it would be essential for the
Central Bank to play a leading role ,albeit in close consultation with the regulator. In
my view that is the more likely outcome.
Conclusion
One theme you may have noticed in these reflections is the need for policy makers to
be willing to back their judgements – whether in identifying asset bubbles or
identifying firms or markets which threaten financial stability – and to take preemptive action.
For example, if most macro-models were not giving us warning signals in recent
years, our analysis of the financial sector certainly was. As I mentioned earlier,
successive Financial Stability Reports did set these dangers out in 2006 and 2007 and
indeed earlier. One of the lessons we have acted on already is to make more of such
warnings. We now send the summary reports to every board member of British banks,
to the rating agencies and to the banking analysts and we are more forthright in
emphasising the dangers through the press in order to try to change the atmosphere in
markets.
But more broadly, we must not let a proper starting assumption that markets should be
allowed to work unless there are good reasons for intervention to become a belief that
markets are not to be touched unless their failure and the effectiveness of intervention
is proved beyond all reasonable doubt. Of course there are risks that some
interventions will be proved with hindsight to be too costly or unnecessary. But the
economy is not an area, to paraphrase Blackstone, where
‘it is better for ten guilty markets to escape than for one innocent to suffer’

assuming that the system is capable of self-regulating itself, our default position

‘I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interest of organizations, specifically banks and others,

quantities, in the private sector, especially, 10 years at a major international back, that the loan officers
of those institutions knew far more about the risks involved and the people to whom they lent money,
than I saw even our best regulators at the Fed capable of doing. So the problem here is something
which looked to be a very solid edifice, and indeed, a critical pillar to market competition and free
markets, did break down.’ See the preliminary transcript of the 23 October 2008 meeting of the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee on The Role of Federal Regulators in the Financial
Crisis.
