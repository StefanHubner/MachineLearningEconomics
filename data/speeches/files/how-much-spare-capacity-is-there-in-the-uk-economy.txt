How Much Spare Capacity is there in the UK Economy?
Summary
1. Judging the extent of spare capacity in the economy is one of the key tasks in
setting interest rates to hit an inflation target. As a general rule, the less spare
capacity, the more inflationary pressure.
2. Estimates of spare capacity in the UK in 2004 by different forecasting groups
vary substantially. At one extreme, the OECD thinks there is less spare
capacity in 2004 than in the boom years of 1999-2000. By contrast, HM
Treasury sees much more spare capacity in 2004 than in 1999-2000 and,
indeed, more than the average during 2001-3.
3. The results presented here suggest the following. First, capacity utilisation
data provided by firms indicate slightly more spare capacity in 2004 than in
1999-2000 and considerably less than in 2001-3.
4. Second, within the labour market, there is more evidence of spare capacity in
2004. Indeed, the data suggest that in 2004, spare capacity is greater, on
average, than the whole period 1999-2003. Wage inflation and labour cost
data are broadly consistent with this picture.
5. Overall, my impression is that the amount of spare capacity in the UK
available in 2004 (and indeed today) is slightly greater than in 1999-2000, not
very different from that in 2001-3 and slightly less than in 1995-98. This
suggests more spare capacity than the OECD numbers indicate but less than
the Treasury figures. On balance, there still appears to be some spare capacity
available in the labour market, but within firms the overall situation is tight.
Finally, it is plain from the data that the amount of spare capacity available is
significantly greater than in the boom of the late 1980s.

1. Introduction
The amount of spare capacity in an economy is the difference between potential
output and actual output, where potential output is the amount which can be produced
given the existing capital stock using the equilibrium number of employees working
for equilibrium hours at the equilibrium level of intensity. Without going into
unnecessary detail, one may think of the equilibrium levels of labour inputs as those
consistent with stable inflation. Consequently, if actual output exceeds potential
output, there is no spare capacity and we may expect inflation to be rising. So the
extent of spare capacity in an economy is a key variable when setting short-term
interest rates to hit an inflation target.
Many forecasting groups produce inverse measures of spare capacity which they term
the output gap (actual output less potential output). In Figure 1, we show a number of
different measures of the output gap. What is plain is that, currently, there is a wide
variety of estimates of the level of the output gap. To see more precise numerical
estimates, we set out some averages in Table 1. What we find is that at one extreme,
HM Treasury sees the UK economy in 2004 as having at least as much spare capacity
as in the previous three years, on average, and very much more than in either of the
periods 1995-98 or 1999-00. By contrast, the OECD1 estimates that there is no
available spare capacity in 2004, with more spare capacity available in 2001-03 and
much more in 1995-98. The other forecasters lie between these two extremes.
The measures of the output gap seen in Figure 1 differ because the teams use different
methods, particularly in the treatment of the public sector, and have different
estimates of equilibrium employment, hours etc. Our purpose here is not to try and
construct yet another measure of the output gap but to see what light other published
data can shed on this issue. The first data series which we consider refer to capacity
utilisation, where firms are asked questions of the form “Are you operating at full
capacity?” or “Is system capacity likely to limit your ability to increase business over
the next 12 months?”. A problem here is that the notion of full capacity is not well
defined. It seems reasonable to suppose that a manufacturing firm is operating at full
capacity if it is using its capital stock at the normal maximum level of operation. The
same would also apply to a service firm like a restaurant. An accountancy firm

3
would, however, probably say it was operating at full capacity if all the professionals
within the firm were busy. It is obvious from these examples that working at full
capacity does not refer to the production of the absolute maximum level of output.
However, data on capacity utilisation does tell us something about the extent of spare
capacity within firms given the existing levels of physical or human capital employed.
Spare capacity in the economy, however, also exists if there are individuals who are
not currently employed who are willing and able to assist in the expansion of existing
capacity by, for example, manning an extra shift or increasing the number of
professionals in a business services company. This leads on to the second group of
data series we consider, namely those which capture the extent of spare resources in
the labour market. In particular we look both at pure labour market data, such as the
unemployment rate, and at data capturing firms’ views on the extent of spare capacity
in the labour market.
Finally, the third type of data series we consider refers to the direct inflationary
consequences of both labour market tightness and high levels of excess demand
facing firms. We then finish with our overall conclusions on the current level of spare
capacity in the UK.
2. Spare Capacity Within Firms
Information on capacity utilisation in manufacturing (20.5% of the private sector) is
available from CBI (Confederation of British Industry) surveys, and these are set out
in Fig.2. We have three capacity related questions. The first, in Fig.2a, reveals the
proportion of firms which are currently operating at full capacity. In Fig.2b, we see
the proportion of firms where (shortage of) plant capacity is expected to limit output
over the next three months and in Fig.2c we have the proportion of firms where
(shortage of) capacity is a reason for capital expenditure over the next twelve months.
The overall picture is one where the 2004 level of capacity utilisation is close to that
in 1999-00, above that in 2001-03 but below that in 1995-98 and well below that in
the late 1980s boom.

4
Turning to the service sector (67.4% of the private sector), the main overall measure
of capacity utilisation is that reported by BCC (British Chambers of Commerce),
presented in Fig.3. On this measure, capacity utilisation in the service sector in 2004
is a little above that in 1999-00 and above that in 2001-03 and 1995-98. The CBI
produces data on the service sector which gives a slightly different impression.
Services are divided into three sub-sectors, business services (39% of services),
consumer services (48% of services) and financial services (13% of services). The
data series presented in Figs.4a, 5a, 6a, refer to the proportion of firms whose level of
business is above normal and those in Figs.4b, 5b, 6b, capture the proportion of firms
where system capacity is likely to limit the level of business over the next 12 months.
The overall picture here suggests that the 2004 level of capacity utilisation is, on
balance, below that in 1999-00, which contrasts with the BCC series.
In order to help us obtain a complete picture, we present a summary table of all the
series (Table 2). The overall impression is that capacity utilisation within firms in
2004 is a little below that in 1999-00 but well above 2001-03. Looking at the first
four rows, it is clear that capacity utilisation in 1995-98 is only a little below that in
2004. Finally, it is plain that manufacturing sector capacity utilisation was far higher
in the late 1980s boom than in any recent period.
3. Spare Capacity in the Labour Market
One way for a firm to raise its output without increasing its capital stock or employing
more people is to raise weekly hours. Average weekly working hours have been
falling steadily since the 19th century, essentially because as individuals become
richer, they choose to take more of their time in the form of leisure. Over the last ten
years, average weekly hours worked in the private sector have still been falling in part
as a continuation of the long-term trend increase in the demand for leisure, in part as a
consequence of the EC Working Time Directive and, more recently, as a response to
the cyclical weakness in 2001-03. In recent months, average weekly hours have
started to rise (see Fig.7). This turn round may simply reflect a temporary blip in the
secular downward trend. On the other hand, it may represent the start of a cyclical
upturn leading to a more permanent increase in normal working hours.

5
Which of these is correct has important implications for the extent of spare capacity.
In the latter case, firms could expand output significantly without hiring any more
employees. In the former case, when weekly hours fall back to their normal levels,
firms would have to raise employment significantly in order to sustain output levels2.
It is hard to say which of these is correct although the fact that there is no apparent
increase in weekly pay corresponding to the rise in weekly hours may suggest a
degree of measurement error in the latter series.
Turning now to the labour market, the overall picture is one where the UK population
aged 16 or over is rising at around 300k p.a. with a little under half of this being the
consequence of net in-migration. This rate of net in-migration has been relatively
stable since 1998 and is significantly higher than in previous decades, probably
because of the buoyancy of the UK labour market over this period relative to that in
continental Europe. In order to maintain a constant employment rate, employment
would have to rise by around 180k p.a. Over the last 12 months, employment has in
fact risen very close to this “neutral” rate. That is consistent with the flattening off of
the employment rate observed in Fig.8 and the unemployment rate in Fig.9. These
days, the unemployment rate is not a particularly good measure of labour market slack
because of the large number of individuals who enter employment from the inactive
population (those who are without work who say they are not looking for work). To
deal with this, we may look at the weighted non-employment rate, which covers all
the non-employed, the numbers in different groups3 of non-employed being weighted
by their exit rates into employment relative to the exit rate of the short-term
unemployed. This series is presented in Fig.10 and shows that the current level of
spare capacity in the labour market is a little above the minimum level attained in
2000.
These overall labour market ratios are not wholly reliable as indicators of labour
market slack in part because structural changes in the labour market have raised
effective labour supply in recent years (see, for example, Nickell and Quintini, 2002).
And this is a continuing process with the various New Deal programs and in-work
benefits (tax credits) still raising the effective supply of labour, albeit slowly.

6
Looking at the extent of labour market slack from the point-of-view of firms, we have
a number of relevant series in both manufacturing and service sectors. In
manufacturing, we present in Figs.11a, 11b the CBI series giving the proportion of
firms where one of the factors limiting output over the next three months is a shortage
of skilled labour and the BCC series on the proportion of firms suffering from
recruitment difficulties. Both series give the same impression of more labour market
slack in 2004 than in 1999-00 and the first reveals much more slack than in the late
1980s boom. In the services sector, we show the BCC series on recruitment
difficulties (Fig.12) and three CBI series on the proportion of firms where the
availability of professional staff is likely to limit the level of business over the next 12
months (Figs.13a, b, c). The overall picture suggests again that there is more labour
market slack in 2004 than in 1999-00.
To arrive at an overview, we present a summary table of all the series (Table 3). The
overall picture is one in which the labour market tightness in 2004 is somewhat lower
than in recent years, being well down on 1999-00 and a little down on 2001-03. This
contrasts with the degree of capacity utilisation within firms in 2004 which is well up
on 2001-03
4. Direct Measures of Inflationary Pressure
If there is no spare capacity in a market and demand continues to rise, then prices in
that market will tend to accelerate, rising relative to costs. So, in circumstances where
it is hard to detect the levels of spare capacity directly, it may be useful to look at
what is happening to prices. Of course, there may be other reasons why prices
accelerate or rise relative to costs, for example, falls in the level of competition in the
market, so this sort of evidence can never be decisive. But it may nevertheless be
helpful to see whether it is consistent with the quantity evidence.
Starting with the labour market, we see in Fig.14 that underlying annual earnings
growth in the private sector has been rising since mid-2003 at roughly the same
average rate as it rose during 1999 and 2000. However, the rate of increase has
slowed in the second half of 2004. Indeed, if we look at the three-month-on-threemonth rate, this had been flat for nearly a year. Turning to the unit labour costs faced

7
by companies, as opposed to pay, we see from Fig.15 that this has been trending
downwards in recent years, essentially because private sector productivity growth has
been outpacing private sector pay growth over this period. Overall, this evidence is
consistent with the view that labour market tightness has not significantly worsened
since 2000.
Turning to product market prices, first we look at the pattern of price inflation and
second we consider the key issue, that is whether or not output price inflation has
been higher than unit cost inflation, since this would be a typical consequence of
excess demand. Output price inflation exceeding unit cost inflation is equivalent to
rising profit margins4, so we look at profit margins in various sectors.
A broad picture of domestic output price inflation is provided in Fig.16, where we
present domestic goods price inflation (excluding petroleum products) in Fig.16a and
CPI service price inflation in Fig.16b. Goods price inflation started rising in 1999 and
continued rising until 2004. However, since mid-2004, the inflation rate has stopped
rising, flattening off at around 2%, despite cost inflation continuing to rise (driven by
commodity prices). CPI service price inflation started rising in 2000 and continued to
rise for nearly three years before falling back. Recently, however, it has gradually
begun to increase again mainly because package holiday prices were unusually weak
in 2003.

Turning to profit margins, in Fig.17 we present two measures, one based on the
Annual Business Inquiry (ABI), the other on National Accounts (NA) data. In Fig.17
a), c), we present estimates of average profit margins in manufacturing from 1995.
The overall picture is one of declining margins from 1997 to 2001. Then, the ABI
data suggest some recovery of margins in 2002 and 2003. However, the NA data
suggest a continuing slow decline in margins right up until 2004. As yet, we do not
clearly understand this discrepancy. (The ONS indicates that the ABI numbers for
2003 are probably better. However, the Datastream estimates of manufacturing
margins for quoted companies look more like the NA data.)

8
The data are more consistent in the service sector, where both the series in Figs.17 b),
d) indicate declines in service sector margins around the turn of the century then
stability in recent years. There is no evidence of any increase in margins in 2004 in
the NA data.
Overall, the data suggest that margins have been relatively stable recently, whereas
they were generally falling around the turn of the century. In the manufacturing
sector, falling margins from 1998 were only to be expected following the huge rise in
the Sterling exchange rate during 1996-7. This would have vastly increased the
competitiveness of foreign companies leading to strong pressure on the margins of
home companies which would have masked any excess demand effects in 1999-00.
Quite why service sector margins were falling for several years after 1999 is not clear
because all the other data suggest that demand was particularly strong in
1999-00.
5. How Much Spare Capacity is there in the UK Economy?
The general picture from the within firm data is that there is slightly more spare
capacity in 2004 than during the previous peak in 1999-2000 with slightly less
capacity than in the late 90s and considerably less than in 2001-03. Within the labour
market there is more evidence of spare capacity in 2004, the data suggesting that in
2004, spare capacity is greater, on average, than over the whole period 1999-2003
although a little less than 1995-98. The wage inflation and labour cost data are
broadly consistent with this picture. However, the price and margins data are more
difficult to interpret although there is no strong evidence of either accelerating prices
or rising margins in 2004.
So what does this all add up to? The overall impression is that the amount of spare
capacity available in 2004 is greater than in 1999-00, not very different from that in
2001-03 and slightly less than in 1995-98. This is at variance with the OECD
numbers in Table 1, where there is less spare capacity in 2004 than in any other
period. It is also at variance with the HMT numbers, where there is more spare
capacity in 2004 than in any other period. On balance, there still appears to be some
spare capacity available in the labour market, but within firms the overall situation is

9
relatively tight. It is plain, however, that the amount of capacity available is
significantly greater than in the boom of the late 1980s.
Footnotes
1. When estimating the output gap, the OECD correctly focuses on the private
sector. The other forecasters tend to operate in the context of the whole
economy including the government sector.
2. It is worth noting that apparently small changes in average weekly hours
generate significant changes in overall GDP. Thus an increase of half an hour
in average weekly hours corresponds to a 1 ½% rise in GDP.
3. The groups are short-term unemployed (<12m), long-term unemployment
(>12m), students, temporarily sick, discouraged, caring for family, long-term
sick, retired, other.
4. The profit margin is profit/(sales revenue).
profit/(sales revenue) =

(sales revenue – costs)/(sales revenue)

=

1 – (costs/sales revenue)

=

1 – (unit cost/price)

So if prices are rising relative to unit costs, then the profit margin is rising.

The service sector is defined as SIC(92), sectors G,H,J,K,O,
namely wholesale, and retail, hotels and restaurants,
transport and communication, renting and business
activities and other services.
Margins are defined as (gross operating surplus)/(gross output). The ABI measure comes from the Annual Business
Inquiry, the NA measure from the National Accounts. They differ because the data come from different sources, notably for
2003 and 2004. The pattern of NA data is thought to be more accurate prior to 2002.
