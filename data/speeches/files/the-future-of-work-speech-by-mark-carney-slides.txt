What has been done
Institution

Effect

Examples

Enabling institutions

Transformed the skill base of workers

Spread of primary, secondary, tertiary
and technical education

New insurance institutions Supported those displaced

Unemployment insurance, universal
healthcare, state pensions, child benefit

Labour market institutions Influenced provisions and shared the
surplus

Friendly Societies, Trade Unions, Cooperatives, minimum wages

Employers

“Model Villages” (providing housing,
schooling and recreation), higher pay
(Ford’s $5 initiative), occupational
pensions

Created environments to help employees
thrive

15

Business
• Identify skills mismatches and adopt anticipatory talent
management strategies
• More effective workforce training, as skill set of existing
employees is rate limiting factor of technology adoption
• Corporate re-training programmes for workers to be
retained by company and returned to workforce
• Providers of general purpose technologies explore
opportunities to maximise job-creating, augmented
intelligence
16

Labour market institutions
• Balance labour mobility with appropriate protection of
workers in new, non-standard jobs
• Taylor Review of modern working practices suggests people
working for platform-based companies be classed as
dependent contractors
• Embrace technology-enabled solutions to improve matching
and bridge skills gaps
• Enhance benefits and data portability (including reputational
histories of dependent contractors)
• Incentives for human capital and physical investment
17

Enabling institutions
• Successive IRs developed primary, secondary and tertiary
education
• Could 4IR lead to quaternary education?
• Institutionalise re-training in mid-career
• Integrated with social welfare system
• Universal support schemes for retraining
• The UK’s Flexible Learning Fund and New Enterprise
Allowance
• Singapore’s SkillsFuture programme
18

Financial system
• New payment solutions for distributed commerce and realtime P2P transactions
• More effective, platform-based finance for SMEs
• Data-based financing for intangibles
• More efficient cross border transactions and trade finance
through better payments plumbing and robust digital IDs
• Expand impact investing to build social capital consistent
with new labour market

Potential inflationary consequences
Inflation

due to increased automation

Increase in structural unemployment from skill
mismatches and other frictions
Lower labour demand relative to supply
