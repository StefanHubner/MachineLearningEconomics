Institution

Effect

Examples

Enabling institutions

Transform the skill base of workers

Spread of primary, secondary, tertiary
and technical education

New insurance institutions Support those displaced

Unemployment insurance, universal
healthcare, state pensions, child benefit

Labour market institutions Provide income support and share out the
surplus

Friendly Societies, Trade Unions, Cooperatives, minimum wages

Employers

“Model Villages” (providing housing,
schooling and recreation), higher pay
(Ford’s $5 initiative), occupational
pensions

Create environments to help employees
thrive

What could be done in the 4th IR
Institution

Solution

Business

•
•

Labour market institutions •
•
•
•

Identify skills mismatches, adopt anticipatory talent management to train
workers
Explore opportunities to maximise job-creating, augmented intelligence
Balance labour mobility with protections of workers in new, non-standard jobs
Establish new class of “dependent contractor” for platform-based workers
Utilise tech solutions to match and bridge skills gaps
Make data portable (including reputational history of platform-based workers)

Enabling institutions

•
•

Finance

AI could potentially:
• Improve customer choice, services and pricing
• Increase access to credit for households and SMEs
• Substantially lower cross border transaction costs
• Improve diversity and resilience of the system

Quaternary education (mid-career, integrated with social welfare system)
Universal support schemes for retraining (UK’s Flexible Learning Fund)

23

AI does well in finance when…
• There are known knowns with a clearly defined question, the future is
expected to behave like the past, and sufficient past data to infer conclusions
(for example, fraud detection, AML/CFT and insurance underwriting)

• Markets have set rules such that speed, consistency and efficiency favour
disciplined arbitrage (e.g. index rebalancing, mean reversion)
• It provides an initial prediction that humans can combine with their
assessments or a second opinion to prompt further review (credit and
compliance assessments)
• It overcomes human biases such as loss aversion or hyperbolic discounting
24

AI for inclusive growth
Embrace the promise of fintech for
households and SMEs
• greater financial inclusion
• more tailored products
• keener pricing
• more diverse sources of credit

Enable new technologies by developing
• hard infrastructure - such as large value
payments systems, RTGS
• soft infrastructure, including rules and
regulations, and capturing data in a
consistent and useable form (LEI)

Empower new providers to promote
competition
• lower barriers to entry through
proportionate supervision
• level the playing field to allow new
players to access hard infrastructure (e.g.
Non-bank PSPs)

AI in finance is challenged by…
• The implications of structural shifts and long-term value drivers (like
demographics, climate change and AI itself!)
• Too little data (known unknowns—Knightian uncertainty)
• The auditability and interpretability of black box algorithms
• Increased dependency on third parties, single points of failure outside
regulatory perimeter
• Bias in data and increased interconnections could lead to potentially procyclical behaviour
• Fundamental trade-offs between innovation and competition and
performance and privacy

the risks for society
