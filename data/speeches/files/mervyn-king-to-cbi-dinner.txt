Certain truths are self-evident. One is that financial markets and the economic outlook
can change quickly and in surprising ways. You in the Nottingham business community
know that only too well. In line with businesses across the United Kingdom, your
economic fortunes have changed markedly over four months.

Before last September, the world economy was slowing and at home the Monetary Policy
Committee published a central projection of falling output in the United Kingdom in the
third quarter. Inflation, though, was still rising. But after the failure of the American
investment bank Lehman Brothers, there was a widespread collapse of confidence in the
banking systems of the industrialised world. That led to an unprecedented and
synchronised downturn in business and consumer confidence around the world. Our
business contacts at home and abroad, and my international counterparts, started to report
that orders and confidence had, in the same telling phrase, “fallen off a cliff”.

Global equity prices fell more in the month following the failure of Lehman Brothers
than in any but a handful of months in the Bank of England’s 300 year history. Chinese
electricity production, having risen steadily at 15% a year, fell in November to a level 8%
lower than a year earlier – the steepest fall on record. Car sales in Brazil contracted by a
quarter compared to a year earlier. In Japan, industrial production fell by 8.5% in just
one month in November, and in Germany, the value of exports declined by over 10%. In
the United States, over a million jobs were lost in the final two months of last year – the
fastest rate of job losses in over 60 years. And in the United Kingdom, manufacturing
output contracted at its fastest rate since 1980. Trade was badly affected – the Baltic Dry
Index, an indicator of demand to ship materials around the world – fell at the fastest pace
on record in October. For the world economy as a whole, consensus forecasts of growth
in 2009 have been revised down from 3% to just 1% since September.1

Governments and central banks around the world responded decisively and boldly with
large fiscal injections and cuts in interest rates, and the provision of hundreds of billions
of pounds in capital and funding to support banks. The scale and urgency of their actions
embodied an audacity born out of pessimism.

3

Tonight I want to ask: what went wrong? How can we limit the impact of the banking
crisis on the wider economy? And can we design a better approach to the management of
our economy and financial system in the future?

So what went wrong? The origins of the crisis lie in the imbalances in the world
economy which built up over a decade or more. The entry of the rapidly growing
economies in Asia into the world trading and financial systems provided a huge new pool
of savings. But their development and exchange rate strategies meant that they were
running large current account surpluses. In other words, their domestic saving was more
than enough to finance investment at home. Significant amounts were channelled into
foreign financial assets. Equally, the policies of the industrialised countries were aimed
at ensuring a sufficient level of total demand to maintain stable inflation, and so desired
levels of output and employment. That required policies to stimulate domestic demand
and current account deficits to offset the surpluses elsewhere. The perverse result was
huge flows of capital from the poorer developing economies to the richer mature
economies.

Large amounts of savings flowing into global financial markets would by themselves
have pushed down real interest rates. That, together with the success of central banks in
the industrialised world in maintaining low and stable inflation – something that they had
not been able to do in the preceding three decades – meant that nominal interest rates fell
even further. As a result, nominal risk free returns fell to levels not seen in a generation.
The combination of a fall in risk-free returns, and large amounts of capital looking for a
home in western capital markets, created a demand for assets offering higher returns – the
so-called search for yield. Investors, including banks, overlooked the fact that higher
returns could be generated only by taking higher risks. As a result, money was lent on
easier terms. That helped to push up further asset prices that had already risen as real
interest rates were falling.

4
It also led to an explosion in the size of the financial sector as new instruments were
created to satisfy the search for yield. As well as lending to households and businesses,
banks lent to other banks which bought ever more exotic instruments created by the
financial system itself. The effect was to replicate the original risky loans many times
over. Over the past five years, the balance sheets of many of the world’s largest banks
more than doubled.

From the early 1990s to the start of the financial turmoil in 2007, total debt in the UK
relative to GDP almost doubled. Around two-thirds of the increase in total debt was
accounted for by lending to the financial sector. A marked expansion in debt of the
financial sector also occurred in the United States and the euro area.

The Bank did not stand idly by during this period. The Monetary Policy Committee set
Bank Rate to achieve the inflation target. Monetary policy – here and in our major
partners – was successful in controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability.
From the early 1990s until the onset of financial turmoil in 2007, output growth, both
here and in the industrialised world in general, was close to its long-run average.
Moreover, through our regular publications and speeches on financial stability the Bank
highlighted the dangers posed by the growth in the size and complexity of the financial
sector. Nevertheless, it is clear that policy did not succeed in preventing the development
of an unsustainable position.

Some have suggested as a result that Bank Rate be directed not only at meeting the
inflation target but also at preventing excessive increases in debt and asset prices.
Leaving to one side the feasibility of targeting the latter, the obvious question is how one
can meet two objectives with one instrument. The answer of course is by accepting a
trade-off between the two objectives. But why should we accept unemployment or high
inflation in order to reduce financial imbalances? It would be more sensible to use
Bank Rate for its traditional task of targeting inflation to maintain a balance between
demand and supply in the economy, and to create a new instrument to limit the build up
of debt.

5

What is required is an additional policy instrument to stabilise the growth of the financial
sector balance sheet. There is an active international debate as to the optimal design of
such an instrument, but one way or another it must provide incentives for banks to reduce
the volatility of their balance sheet.

It is also clear that at the heart of the crisis was the problem identified but not solved at
Bretton Woods – the need to impose symmetric obligations on countries that run
persistent current account surpluses and not just on countries that run deficits. From that
failure stemmed a chain of events, no one of which alone appeared to threaten stability,
but which taken together led to the worst financial crisis any of us can recall. For several
years the Bank of England and other UK participants in the international fora argued for a
major reform of the international monetary system and the IMF in order to address this
issue.

The gravity of the present crisis demonstrates the urgency of rectifying both of these
deficiencies.

In the past year the true scale of the risks taken by financial institutions has become
painfully apparent. As losses mount it has become obvious that banks did not have
sufficient capital to support their inflated balance sheets. Questions about the adequacy
of liquidity have turned into questions about solvency. In response, banks have been
trying to raise new capital and shrink their balance sheets. The banking system is in the
throes of a difficult and prolonged adjustment to much smaller balance sheets relative to
their equity capital – or leverage, as it is known. Leverage ratios of large banks remain at
remarkably high levels, and the required adjustment will not happen quickly.

I know that bankers around the world realise this. The incentives they face to adjust, in
whatever way they can, are now overwhelming. With fresh capital from the private
sector difficult to obtain, banks have opted to reduce their lending and that is why the
flow of credit to all parts of the economy, here and abroad, has been heavily disrupted.

6
And the credit that is still flowing is available only on materially tighter terms and
conditions. But the fact that much of the increase in debt occurred within the financial
sector means that the necessary unwinding of balance sheets could and should take place
primarily within the financial sector. That is why the Bank of England has been
monitoring carefully the lending by banks to the non-financial sector – businesses and
households – and why the lending agreements announced yesterday which will be
negotiated between Government and individual banks will focus on lending to those
sectors. There is scope for a reduction in the leverage of banks without restricting
lending to the “real” economy. But to bring that about much of the necessary “netting”
of exposures would be cross-border, demonstrating that almost every aspect of the
present crisis has an international dimension.

What is the appropriate policy response in present circumstances? Some say that because
the massive increase in indebtedness contributed to the crisis the right response is to save
and repay debt. Others argue that the only way out of our present difficulties is to borrow
and spend more. Who is right?

Both are – up to a point. We cannot avoid the necessary long-term adjustment. To
pretend otherwise would only store up problems for the future. But we can try to slow
the pace of the adjustment to domestic demand in order to limit its impact on output and
employment. So we need to take actions now that will dampen the adjustment in the
short term while recognising that the adjustment will ultimately need to be made. This is
the paradox of policy at present – almost any policy measure that is desirable now
appears diametrically opposite to the direction in which we need to go in the long term.
Spending now supports the economy, but in the long run we need to save more and
borrow less. Public borrowing sustains spending, but in the long run needs to fall. Banks
are encouraged to run down their capital to enable them to absorb losses while continuing
to lend, but in the long run they will need more capital. Interest rates have fallen to
unprecedented levels, but in the long run will need to rise to more normal levels.

7
In each area of policy it is important that there is a clear framework which guides both
the short-term response to the current downturn and the exit strategy when normal
conditions return. For monetary policy, the inflation target is that framework. Bank Rate
is set to meet our target of 2% for the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation.

For a decade inflation and Bank Rate were remarkably stable. But in only four months,
the MPC has cut Bank Rate by 3½ percentage points to its lowest ever level of 1½%.
Does this mean we have changed our target? No. We have taken those actions precisely
because the sudden downturn in the world and UK economies created a significant risk
that inflation would fall below the 2% target.

Despite those big cuts, there remains a risk that inflation will fall below 2%. The
disruption to the banking system has impaired the effectiveness of our conventional
interest rate instrument. And with Bank Rate already at its lowest level in the Bank’s
history, it is sensible for the MPC to prepare for the possibility – and I stress that we are
not there yet – that it may need to move beyond the conventional instrument of
Bank Rate and consider a range of unconventional measures. They would take the form
of purchases by the Bank of England of a range of financial assets in order to expand the
amount of reserves held by commercial banks and to increase the availability of credit to
companies. That should encourage the banking system to expand the supply of broad
money by lending to the private sector and also help companies to raise finance from
capital markets.

The conventional approach to such unconventional measures is to buy assets, such as
government securities or gilts, which are traded in liquid markets to boost the supply of
money. Provided the additional reserves are not simply hoarded by banks, as happened
to some extent in Japan earlier in this decade, such asset purchases can increase the
supply of broad money and credit and the liquidity of private sector portfolios, raising
spending. The effectiveness of this approach is likely to be enhanced by the clear
commitment by the MPC to take the measures necessary to meet the inflation target in
the medium term.

8

In addition to these conventional unconventional measures there are also unconventional
unconventional measures. When credit markets are dysfunctional, as some are at present,
targeted purchases by the Bank of England of assets may improve liquidity in markets for
those credit instruments. The objective of such purchases would be not only to boost the
supply of broad money but also to increase liquidity and trading activity in the markets
for those assets. A reduction in the illiquidity premium for a particular credit instrument
might help to stimulate issuance by corporate borrowers and the resumption of capital
market flows, thus reducing reliance on bank lending. It could also raise the values of
assets that are currently under-priced because of high illiquidity premia, helping to
strengthen the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions.

Yesterday the Government authorised the Bank of England to conduct such operations,
financed by the issue of Treasury Bills, in order to improve the flow of credit to
companies. But at some point the Monetary Policy Committee might wish to adopt these
unconventional measures as an instrument of monetary policy.

In conducting such operations, it is important to choose the markets in which to intervene
extremely carefully. There is a fine dividing line between helping to oil the wheels in
markets which are temporarily impaired, and artificially supporting markets in which
there is no underlying demand. That is why, as Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke said
in London last week, central banks will look to intervene only in markets that “normally
play major roles” in the functioning of the financial system. Therefore, the Bank will
need to be satisfied that there is a genuine private demand for an asset in normal
conditions before it would be eligible for the asset purchase facility. We are aiming to
complement and stimulate private demand, not substitute for it.

The Bank is actively considering in which markets targeted purchases might stimulate
new issuance. One example is the corporate bond market. Spreads on high quality
corporate bonds have more than doubled since early September to an average of over
5 percentage points. Despite innovation in financial markets this is the highest spread

9
since the mid-1970s. The Bank estimates that a significant element of this spread
represents an illiquidity premium which could be reduced somewhat by increasing
activity and liquidity in the market. Commercial paper is another case where purchases
might help, although that market is considerably smaller in the United Kingdom than in
the United States. In each case the Bank will keep the market fully informed, and more
details will be published at the end of the month. It will be a matter of weeks not days
before a programme of purchases can begin, but it will be weeks not months.

There is another reason to tread carefully. Such asset purchases involve taking more
credit risk onto the public sector balance sheet. That is why the Bank will consider
purchasing only high quality assets.

Despite the existence of a range of unconventional instruments, monetary policy is likely
to be more effective when the banking system is working normally. So the first priority
for policy is to fix the banking system so that it can resume its normal lending function.
The contraction of lending to ordinary viable businesses – your businesses – is
threatening to drive the economy further into recession. The package of measures
announced yesterday by the Chancellor are not designed to protect the banks as such.
They are designed to protect the economy from the banks. In particular, the Asset
Protection Scheme aims to remove a degree of uncertainty about the future losses banks
will make. It also has the effect of reducing the amount of capital banks need to hold
against their risky assets. Both effects will serve to strengthen and underpin banks'
balance sheets and so support their lending to the real economy. To be clear, the scheme
does not mean that the taxpayer will bear the full brunt of past lending mistakes by
banks. Rather, there is sharing of losses between shareholders and the government – or
coinsurance – with the government providing, at a price, insurance against only extreme
outcomes for the banks. That can be to the advantage of all of us if banks help to
underwrite the economy through the agreed lending targets and government underwrites
the balance sheet of the banks. The insurance policy will be most cost-effective for
taxpayers if all the major lenders sign up to lending targets.

10
Nevertheless, the problems in the financial sector mean that 2009 will be a difficult year
for all of us. A pronounced contraction in spending and output is underway. As
expected, output in the UK economy fell in the third quarter of 2008, but the downward
momentum intensified in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing output is falling, and the key
service sector surveys have reached record low levels in recent months. Total output in
the fourth quarter is expected to have fallen sharply. In the first half of this year, the rate
of contraction is likely to continue to be marked, and our trading partners are
experiencing similar problems.

But the very significant policy actions taken in recent months will eventually stimulate a
recovery in demand, output and employment. Bank Rate has fallen from 5% to 1½%.
And, as I have explained, the Monetary Policy Committee has a range of options to
stimulate the economy further if required. Fiscal policy has been eased. The banking
system is receiving massive support to cope with the need to restructure its balance
sheet. That will take time, but time is a great healer, even of banks. Since the summer,
the exchange rate has fallen by almost 20%; and oil prices have fallen by around twothirds, both of which will boost demand. No one can know at what point the impact of all
this stimulus will have a visible effect on activity; the lags in economic policy are
notoriously long and unpredictable. But well-designed policies implemented within a
consistent policy framework will eventually work.
