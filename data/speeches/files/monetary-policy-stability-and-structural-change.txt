Monetary policy, stability and structural change

In this speech,(1) Paul Tucker,(2) Executive Director for Markets and a member of the Monetary Policy
Committee, discusses structural changes affecting the UK economy and confronting policymakers. That
pervasive change has occurred is evident in, for example, lower variability in output growth and
inflation; less inertia in inflation; and uncertainty about the extent to which demand pressures feed
through into wages and prices. The underlying forces affecting firms’ price and wage-setting behaviour
include more flexible labour markets, more complete capital markets, globalisation, the IT revolution —
and also monetary regime change itself, which makes it easier for businesses and consumers to
distinguish relative price changes from more generalised price inflation. Disentangling the effects of
such structural shifts from cyclical influences on the economy is a major challenge, which highlights the
uncertainty facing policymakers. Against that background, Mr Tucker points out that debates about
cyclical conditions often lie well within the margins of error of any sensible estimate of underlying trends;
and that a sense of perspective is needed about month-to-month deviations from the inflation target.
Over the medium term, well-anchored inflation expectations are vital to the regime. But policy
credibility cannot be assumed. It has to be achieved, and continually re-achieved, by policymakers —
through actions, and reasoned explanations of those actions.

Judging by the macroeconomic data, either there have
been some fairly profound changes in our economy or
we have been blessed by extraordinary good luck over
the past decade or so. GDP has grown without
interruption for 50 quarters. Unemployment has fallen
from around 101/2% in 1992 to 61/2% in 1997, and just
over 41/2% on the latest reading. Inflation fell through
the first half of the 1990s, and since 1997 has, on
average, been close to the Government’s target. All that
is, of course, well known.
But it may be less familiar that quarter-to-quarter
changes in output growth and inflation have over recent
years exhibited a strikingly different pattern from those
of previous decades. Both output growth and inflation
have been less variable (Chart 1; Table A). Inflation also
seems to have become less persistent. By that, I mean
that, whereas in the past rises or falls in inflation tended
to be protracted, more recent fluctuations in inflation
have been short-lived. Work undertaken by Bank of
England and other economists,(3) summarised in
Table B, suggests that — at least statistically — this
apparent change occurred around the time of the

Lower variability in output growth and inflation, lower
inflation persistence, apparently weaker pass-through of
demand pressures — all told, this points to the
importance of identifying and understanding the
complex combination of structural changes affecting our
economy. Today, I plan to give a broad overview of some
of them, as they confront policymakers.
Our standard tools of economic analysis — in particular,
statistical modelling — are not especially well-suited to
real-time detection or quantification of the underlying
forces of change. They can, though, alert us to puzzles
when the data persistently deviate from past patterns.
Business managers, by contrast, are exposed to the reality
of change day by day. Unable to shield yourselves from

United Kingdom’s introduction of inflation targeting in
1992.
The policy debate — inside and outside the Bank — has
recently refocused on the possibility of some other
changes in the way our economy functions. Less than
18 months ago, the Bank’s interest rate was just 3.5%,
essentially because the MPC wanted to stimulate private
sector domestic spending to offset the effects on
aggregate demand of weak net trade, given adverse
developments in the world economy. As global
conditions recovered, and with a pickup in public sector
spending, we were able gradually to withdraw much of
that stimulus during 2004 in a series of steps which were
widely anticipated and understood across the financial
and real economy (Chart 2). With the slack in the
economy being absorbed, attention shifted to gauging
the degree of demand pressures and their implications
for the inflation outlook. In particular, on the basis of
some simple statistical relationships, a question has been
posed about whether there has been some change in the
extent to which demand pressures feed through into
wages and prices. Most notably, as discussed in the
Bank’s February Inflation Report, the steady falls in
unemployment over recent years have not been
accompanied by a rising rate of earnings growth (Chart
3). These issues obtained some prominence towards the
end of last year when, despite apparently buoyant
demand, inflation on the CPI measure fell to 1.1%.

change, businesses can indeed succeed by embracing it
— shaping your environment as well as responding to it.
That underlines the value of the Bank’s dialogue with
business, facilitated and led by our regional Agents
across the United Kingdom. Colloquially, you enrich our
grasp of what is ‘going on out there’. Economic analysis
then helps us to match your various real-world stories to
puzzles we see in the data.

Inflation and firms’ price-setting behaviour
In the medium-to-long run, the average rate of inflation
is determined by the rate of nominal expansion
permitted by the monetary authority. But over shorter
horizons, decisions taken by businesses — in particular,
about wages and prices — affect quarter-to-quarter

Monetary policy, stability and structural change

fluctuations in inflation and, more generally, how
demand pressures feed through to inflation.
Economic policymakers draw on a number of ways of
thinking about those influences on inflation dynamics.
There is no model that can, uniquely, capture the
richness of the real world. But surprising though it may
be to some, one of the ways in which we think about
firms’ price-setting behaviour would be familiar to
anyone running a business. Namely, that firms charge a
mark up, or profit margin, over the marginal costs of
their various inputs — labour, capital, raw and
intermediate materials, etc — with both the mark up
and costs varying according to current and prospective
demand conditions. This is represented schematically,
indeed crudely, in Diagram 1. The key feature is that
when demand rises and firms utilise their capacity more
fully and add to their labour force, their costs and
prices tend to rise. That might involve old-fashioned
‘cost-push’ inflation, with firms raising prices to maintain
margins in the face of increased (marginal) costs. Or
firms might initially be able temporarily to raise margins,
with labour and other costs later ‘catching up’. In either
case, firms and wage bargainers will be influenced by
what they think is going to happen to inflation in the
future. Again simplifying, two features are added to the
diagram to bridge from firms’ so-called ‘output’ — or
wholesale — prices to the retail prices which the Bank
targets. First, as well as being an input to producing
firms, some imports are directly consumed by
households. Second, distributors — including, most
obviously, retailers — add another mark up, reflecting
their own costs and desired profit margins. Changes in
the economy affecting any of the links in this (stylised)
chain will have a bearing on inflation dynamics. The
challenge is to separate out cyclical, or temporary,
factors from the more structural influences that over
Diagram 1
Inflation process

some periods alter firms’ costs and margins. That is
important for policymakers, as to form a view on the
medium-term outlook for inflation we need to
distinguish between short-lived and persistent
influences.
Monetary regime change
The monetary framework is one such structural
influence.
One of the most encouraging features of the post-1997
landscape has been that, as well as inflation tracking the
target fairly well, expectations of inflation have been well
anchored to the target (Chart 4). Uncertainty about
future inflation has also fallen(1) (Chart 5). It was
different in the past. A characteristic shared by the

various monetary regimes tried out by UK governments
during the 1970s and 1980s was that no one could easily
judge what rate of inflation the authorities were trying
to achieve — or, therefore, have much idea about the
outlook for inflation. As feared by one distinguished
economist of an earlier generation, ‘every business
venture [risks being] transformed into a speculation on
monetary policy’.(1) In those circumstances, it may well
have seemed reasonable to assume that recent inflation
outturns were a good basis for guessing the near-term
path of inflation. And given the evidence, firms and
households could also have been forgiven for acting on
an assumption that the authorities would be slow to
respond to excess demand and so to upward pressures on
inflation.
By contrast, the current regime seems, so far at least, to
enjoy high credibility. In consequence, when setting
prices, firms might well place more weight on policy
delivering inflation in line with the target than on recent
inflation outturns. If so, that might be part of the
explanation for the much lower persistence in inflation I
described earlier. In other words, when shocks to the
economy cause inflation to deviate from target, firms
may nevertheless set prices on the basis that it will
return to target fairly quickly — which would, of course,
itself help to bring inflation back to target. In a similar
vein, firms and households might now expect the
Bank to tweak policy fairly promptly in response to
shifts in demand. In which case, the influence of such
demand shocks on wage and price-setting, and so on
inflation, would plausibly be somewhat weaker than in
the past.
But sound monetary policy is not the only important
change in the economic environment. That much is
apparent from even a brief examination of real-economy
influences on firms’ costs and prices. I shall discuss just
three: the labour market, financing markets, and
competitive conditions in product markets.

Labour market
For most businesses, their workforce accounts for the
major part of their input costs (Chart 6). Firms in
general — and the economy in aggregate — have
therefore been profoundly affected by the
transformation in the United Kingdom’s labour market
over the past quarter century. The key influences have

been well documented.(2) In particular, industrial
relations legislation altered the way in which unions
operate, and union membership has fallen (Chart 7).
Unemployment and social security benefits have been
progressively reformed, increasing incentives to work.
Use of part-time workers has increased (Chart 8), in part
due to the expansion of the services sector, and perhaps
also more flexible ideas about working patterns. The
mechanisms via which employers and employees find
each other — job search — have improved, helped by
investment in employment exchanges and perhaps
recently by the internet.
In combination, these developments provided the
conditions for unemployment to fall over the past
decade without adding to inflationary pressure. During
the transition, the supply capacity of the economy
accordingly increased by more than would otherwise
have been achieved; and any given increase in real
aggregate demand would have put less pressure than
otherwise on supply, and so would have had a weaker
effect on firms’ costs and prices. That does not mean,
however, that the feed-through of demand pressures into
inflation will be permanently weaker. Instead, the
apparently flat relationship, illustrated in Chart 3,
between unemployment and wage inflation is, at least in
part, most probably a symptom of the sustainable level of
unemployment having gradually fallen. That is
effectively what the MPC has assumed in making
judgements about the outlook for inflation. We can be
reasonably confident about the direction of change, but
not about its size.

has increased in various sectors — partly associated
with the enlargement of the EU’s single labour market.
If that continued, with new residents continuing to help
to meet particular skill shortages, the labour supply
available to UK businesses would increase, implying that
the economy could potentially accommodate stronger
aggregate demand than otherwise. However, the
available data do not really enable us to get beyond
anecdote and speculation.

That can be illustrated by the current conjuncture. Over
the past few years, there have been at least two other
influences at work. First, for some years we enjoyed an
improvement in our ‘terms of trade’. That meant, simply
put, that the aggregate price of the goods and services
we produce and export rose relative to the aggregate
prices of our imports. This increased the purchasing
power of households’ incomes (Chart 9), and so may
have dampened wage pressures as the labour market
tightened. To the extent that this explanation should be
given any weight, it would tend to be a temporary factor,
pointing to an upside risk to earnings growth looking
ahead.
A second apparent feature of our environment works the
other way round. Anecdotally, the role of migrant labour

Another important input for firms is finance — for
working capital and investment. Here too, there seem to
have been changes — in the range and terms of the
sources of finance available to both firms and
households — that could potentially influence the
extent of cyclical fluctuations in output and inflation.
One characterisation of the past would be that firms and
households depended on bank loans for external
finance; and that banks loosened or tightened credit
conditions sharply in the different phases of a business
cycle, reining back when the economy suffered a
downturn and arrears and losses mounted. For the
United Kingdom, this is well documented for small-firm
finance during the early 1990s’ recession.(1)
Although the stability of output growth over the recent
past happily deprives us of a proper test, there are
reasons to think that cyclical swings in the availability of
finance may now be somewhat less marked than in the
past. In the first place, the greater stability brought by
the new monetary regime may make a difference.

Compared with the past, there should be less risk of the
monetary authority delaying a response to incipient
inflation until the point that it is forced to slam on the
brakes, effectively engineering recession to quell
inflation expectations and in the process contributing to
a sharp spike in unemployment, loan defaults and bank
losses.
A more stable macroeconomic environment may also, by
reducing the risks for new entrants, be one amongst a
number of influences fostering competition. There is
perhaps some circumstantial evidence of that in, for
example, the decline in margins on personal loans
(Chart 10). That would tend to reduce the credit
constraints facing households. As does the increased
availability of loan products that enable homeowners to
borrow against the free equity in their houses.

Broadly similar changes have been underway in business
finance, where competition also comes from outside the
banking sector through firms’ access to richer capital
markets. The proportion of UK non-financial firms’
debt accounted for by bonds has risen from around
15% in 1990 to over 30% now (Chart 11). Our largest
firms have access to the international commercial paper,
bond and asset-backed markets; and to derivative
markets for managing their financial risks. For smaller
firms, compared with a decade or so ago, there seems
to have been an expansion in asset-based financing
options enabling them to utilise collateral more
effectively.(1)
Taken together, a richer supply menu may leave firms
and households somewhat less exposed to being severely

credit rationed in an economic downturn; and may
enhance their ability to cope with cyclical economic
fluctuations. If that helped to dampen the effect of
shocks, output growth and inflation may vary a little less
than otherwise, and monetary policy may need to
respond less aggressively than in the past to keep the
economy on a stable path.
But, again, it can be difficult to disentangle cyclical from
more durable changes. A topical example is the risk
premium priced into financial instruments. To pick
just one indicator, corporate credit spreads have been
falling for a few years, to levels that last prevailed in the
mid-1990s (Chart 12). In degree, that seems likely to
reflect a relatively benign global macroeconomic
environment together with balance-sheet strengthening
in the corporate sectors of a number of major
industrialised countries. But, conceivably, it also reflects
better diversification of risk — facilitated, for example,

by the rapid growth of new instruments such as credit
derivatives and by greater cross-border investment of
savings. If so — if risk premia were systemically lowered
— that would tend to reduce firms’ cost of capital and
increase households’ financial wealth. Alternatively, the
price of risk may just be temporarily low, possibly too
low.(1) The upshot is that we cannot yet be confident
about the durability and macroeconomic implications of
the changes seen in the financial environment.

It is a commonplace that competition has intensified.

This is associated with ‘globalisation’. The facts are
familiar. World trade has grown relative to world output
(Chart 13). A wide range of emerging market economies,
notably in Asia, have become material participants in the
world economy. Some UK businesses have relocated part
of their production, or outsourced to firms operating in
markets with cheaper labour costs. Partly reflecting
these developments, although also increased
specialisation, the share of imports in UK business
investment and in consumption has steadily risen
(Chart 14).

The internet, or e-commerce, also brings greater
contestability, by making it a lot easier for businesses to
check the prices of competing suppliers, and for
consumers to compare prices across different retailers

Over time, these forces would be expected to reduce
firms’ margins — at least in sectors that were not
previously especially competitive. So long as that
process of adjustment was underway, inflation would
tend to be lower than would otherwise be implied by any
given set of demand conditions. In addition, if and
when their margins became thinner, firms might become
more aggressive in controlling costs in the face of
fluctuating demand, which might weaken the
pass-through of demand shocks into inflation.
The new monetary framework might reinforce some of
those effects. Over recent years, more than a handful of

business managers have commented that, when inflation
was both high and highly variable, it used to be easier to
implement — or ‘get away with’ — price increases. In a
low inflation environment, it should be easier for
business customers and consumers to distinguish
relative price changes from increases in the general
price level. That too should foster greater flexibility and
efficiency in our economy; and is one of the
contributions that low and stable inflation can
potentially make to broader economic welfare.

Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Summer 2005

One striking example is the distribution sector.
Anecdotally, competition in UK retailing has been
intense. This seems to manifest itself in the aggregate
data in two phases. As documented recently by my MPC
colleague Steve Nickell,(1) retailers’ margins were
compressed in the years around the turn of the century.
Since then, they seem to have crushed their costs
through measures delivering rapid productivity growth.
In part, that appears to have been achieved by
disintermediating wholesale distributors, whose margins
have continued to fall (Chart 15). At a macro level, the
effect was, for a period, to open up a gap between
producer output price inflation and retail goods price
inflation (Chart 16). In other words, for a while some
structural changes in the distribution sector reduced the
feed-through of demand pressures into retail price
inflation. Looking ahead, one downside risk to the
MPC’s central projection is that we cannot rule out that
this process has further to go.

The current conjuncture and policy

Monetary regime change, labour market reform,
financial innovation, the technological revolution,
globalisation — it is a heady combination, which
unavoidably adds to the challenge of discriminating
between cyclical and structural influences when forming
a view on the macroeconomic outlook. But it is equally
unavoidable that policymakers must try to do just that.
That brings me to the current conjuncture and so to
policy.
My own take at present is as follows. In my judgement,
there is, on balance, most likely a degree of excess
demand in the economy. Surveys suggest above-average
capacity utilisation. And there is some corroborative

Given a tight labour market, how does that fit with
earnings inflation having been relatively subdued? One
possibility is that as aggregate demand has picked up,
firms have in the first place increased output by making
greater use of their existing workforce and capital. That
would be consistent with anecdotal evidence of firms
having held on to labour during the earlier slowdown in
aggregate demand; and with the pickup in private sector
productivity growth over the past year or so (Chart 18).
Looking ahead, it would also suggest a degree of
upwards pressure on earnings growth.

likelihood of stronger import prices, point to inflation
gradually rising back towards and through the 2% target
over the next two years or so. There are many risks
around that central outlook but, taken together,
compared with November 2004 I judge them to be
slightly less to the downside over the medium term. The
recent rise in CPI inflation suggests, for example, that we
were not stuck materially below the inflation target.
And, as I discussed earlier, the puzzle about the apparent
weak feed-through from demand to inflation is reduced
somewhat by the Committee’s judgement that the
performance of the labour market improved over recent
years. That leaves continuing demand pressures likely to
feed through to inflation, looking ahead. With monetary
policy needing to be set on a medium-term view, overall I
concluded at the MPC’s latest meeting that our interest
rate should be increased by 25 basis points — a small
tweak to reflect the outlook.
But, as my remarks today have emphasised, there are
considerable uncertainties. Two final thoughts about
them.
The first concerns the precision with which any
monetary authority can achieve its objective. In the bad
old days, it should probably have been clear when the
economy was experiencing unsustainable excess demand.
In today’s world, when we discuss excess or deficient
demand we are generally addressing much smaller
deviations from trend than in the past, as Chart 19
suggests. In consequence, our debates about cyclical
conditions lie well within the margin of error of any
sensible estimate of underlying trends — especially
given uncertainty about the structural changes affecting
the economy. In a similar vein, we — and commentators

estimates of the changes in output estimated to be due purely to changes in

— need to keep some perspective about deviations from
the inflation target. In November 2004, the year-on-year
measure of CPI inflation was 1.1%. By January 2005 it
was 1.6%.
Second, when inflationary problems loomed in the past,
inflation expectations — amongst businesses,
households and in financial markets — increased, both
signalling and bringing about the incipient rise in
inflation. Today, we appear to enjoy well-anchored
inflation expectations, which will affect price-setting
behaviour in the ways I have touched on. Indeed,
modern economic models of various kinds — inside and
outside the Bank — tend to assume policy credibility,
anchoring medium-term expectations. If that were so,
the medium-term outlook for inflation would be assured.
In fact, credibility is not something that can just be
assumed. It has to be achieved, and continually
re-achieved, by policymakers — through our actions,
and reasoned explanations of them.
For that reason alone, policy inevitably remains a
judgemental process — not one mechanically tied to a
particular model, but one that draws on a wide range of
inputs, including the insights of our business contacts.
Learning is, accordingly, inherent in our mission. Over
the next few years, if the economy escapes being
buffeted by shocks, we will learn quite a lot. In the
meantime, notwithstanding the uncertainties, we have to
make judgements and explain them.
