REFLECTIONS ON OPERATING INFLATION TARGETING

Next month will be the fourth anniversary of my appointment to the Monetary Policy
Committee. It is time to draw together some of my thoughts on operating an
inflation-targeting regime. Very much from the perspective of a practitioner, but
engaging with some of the academic literature on our mission and, in particular,
policy strategy.1 At the outset, I should make it absolutely clear that these are my
own personal views, and do not necessarily represent those of individual colleagues
on the MPC or those of the Committee as a whole†.
Scene setting
The UK was not quite the first country to adopt inflation targeting – Canada and
New Zealand got there before us. But it has certainly taken off since our conversion,
in 1992. It is now the explicit framework of over 20 countries, including more than
fifteen in the emerging market world. And the IMF recently reported2 that another 20
have sought technical assistance on introducing it.
The spread of inflation targeting has coincided with a period – pretty well everywhere
in the developed world, except Japan – of low, stable inflation, and well-anchored
inflation expectations. The Great Moderation cannot plausibly be attributed to
inflation targeting narrowly defined, because the biggest monetary systems – the US,
and the euro area – are not explicit inflation targeters. But some commentators do
attribute the Great Stability – as it gets called in the UK, since we have enjoyed stable
growth as well as low inflation – to shared ideas about the conduct of monetary
policy, ideas that are embodied in inflation targeting.

3
Is all this too good to be true? Are there no challenges facing us? Or have central
bankers finally cracked how to do monetary policy after around a century of
managing fiat money?
A simple story of what central bankers do
As background, I am going to work within the framework of what has become the
most commonplace stylised account – ie in simple models – of what central banks do.
Society and/or central bankers are assumed to care about deviations of inflation from
a target, and of the level of output from potential, typically represented by a quadratic
loss function. That is equivalent to wanting to ensure that inflation will not on
average be biased away from the target, and to avoid a volatile inflation rate; and
similarly for the ‘output gap’.
Given that objective, the determinants of aggregate demand, and a short-run trade off
between output and inflation, the monetary policymaker is assumed to proceed by
setting interest rates in the light of the outlook for demand relative to supply and for
inflation.
The central bank decides a nominal interest rate, which it establishes in the money
markets3. As the prices of many goods and services are sticky, this has the effect of
enabling the central bank to move around the actual short-term real rate of interest
relative the ‘natural’ or ‘neutral’ real rate4 that would prevail in the absence of those
frictions.
Broadly, another consequence of prices and wages being sticky, together with some
inertia in inflation, is that when shocks hit the economy, the central bank cannot get
inflation to return to target instantly. So the central bank needs to take account of the
infamous long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy decisions to
the things it cares about5. In other words, in today’s vernacular the central banker has
to be forward looking, in particular about the outlook for inflation. That, essentially,
is why some economists refer to central banks as undertaking inflation-forecast
targeting6.

4

Under this regime, the central bank needs to form judgments on some big things. On
the current and prospective pressure of demand on the supply (or productive) capacity
of the economy; on the implications for the outlook of any cost shocks (eg oil price
rises); and on whether medium-to-long-term expectations of inflation are well
anchored to its (explicit or implicit) target.
Having done that and so formed a view on the outlook for inflation, the central bank
may have to decide how quickly to bring inflation back to target, in the light of how
much weight it gives to containing volatility in output7. It then needs to decide
whether it should set policy so as to restrain or stimulate aggregate demand, or to be
neutral. And it therefore needs to judge whether the current level of interest rates is,
in fact, likely to deliver its desired degree of stimulus or restraint.
Underlying those ‘big picture’ judgments are, at least implicitly, views on some
fundamental economic variables. Notably, on the supply capacity of the economy and
its prospective rate of growth; on the rate of unemployment below which inflation is
liable to increase; on the natural (or neutral) real interest rate. Those judgments are,
in truth, formidably difficult to make, because they need to be regularly updated given
structural change in the economy; and because each of the variables is unobservable!
Perhaps understandably, that leads some policymakers8 to the conclusion that these
concepts may be useful as just that – concepts – but not at all in practical decision
taking. Whilst not wanting to deny their unobservability, I do not take quite that
view. For example, the natural real rate may be unobservable, but there is no ducking
the fact that a policymaker needs to form a view on whether its policy stance is
stimulating or restraining demand, which amounts to broadly the same thing.
Against that background, I can return to a central bank’s objectives. To maintain
inflation in line with a target over the medium term. And, typically with less priority,
to stabilise the path of output in the face of cyclical shocks; in the UK Government’s
mandate to the Bank of England9, that is expressed in terms of, inter alia, the MPC
avoiding ‘undesirable volatility in output’. I shall say something about both, before

5
going on to discuss some issues concerning monetary policy strategy that have
featured in recent academic commentary.
Medium-term inflation expectations, forecasts, and models: nominal stuff

In terms of the primary objective of delivering stable inflation, it has helped the UK to
have a clear target. In contrast to many inflation-targetting countries10, we have a
point target: 2% on the consumer price index. That leaves no room for debate in our
(one person – one vote) committee about what the target is. And there should be no
uncertainty amongst households, firms and participants in financial markets about the
steady-state rate of inflation being targeted. In other words, a point target makes
communication somewhat more straightforward.
Of course, that is not the same as saying that we can guarantee to deliver inflation
outturns consistently in line with the target over an economic cycle. Shocks, and even
policy mistakes, will cause inflation to deviate from target. Explaining such
deviations matters.
Especially when being reappointed for a further term, MPC members are typically
asked by the House of Commons’ Treasury Select Committee whether the MPC has
made any big mistakes11.
In response, we often talk about luck, diligence etc. But I think that the best test –
perhaps the only important test – is whether medium-to-long-term inflation
expectations have been dislodged from the target.
In the UK, expectations have generally been in line with our target since the Bank was
given operational independence. But as the recent slight tick up in some measures
illustrates, we have to be constantly vigilant. By contrast, an uncomfortable amount
of commentary – academic and in the media – proceeds as if that particular battle is
won for all time; the ‘death of inflation’ school of thought.
Indeed, seductively, these days ‘victory’ tends to be inscribed in to the economic
models used by central banks as an input to their forecasts. Reflecting the

6
achievements of this university, our models have a well-defined steady state
equilibrium for the real economy; well-defined steady state nominal properties,
typically an inflation rate; and forward-looking rational expectations, that is to say
model-consistent expectations. The second of these characteristics means that a
nominal target is always achieved in the medium-to-long run. And the third means
that the model’s agents know that; ie they know now and behave – set wages and
prices – accordingly, so that in these mainstream models the target is achieved over
cyclical frequencies too.
Typically, nominal things enter via inflation expectations, and they are pinned down
in the stylised, model economy by a policy rule of the kind I sketched earlier,
expressed in terms of an official interest rate (the price of base money). But just in
case it were thought that the “problem” of models promising the policymaker success
stems from the crime of ignoring money quantities, I should make it clear that that is
not so. It would not make a fundamental difference in policymakers’ modern-macro
models if nominal stuff entered via a money quantity, with the policy rule being
specified as a money-supply growth rate. So-called velocity shocks to the demand for
money would cause deviations from an inflation target in the short run, but everything
would ultimately settle down nicely – because that assumption would be built in to the
model’s long-run properties (in this instance via a demand-for-money equation that
was imposed as stable over the long run).
I’m exaggerating a bit. Forward-looking models can be set up in ways where things
go wrong for a while. In particular, by allowing agents to learn more or less gradually
that the monetary authority really does mean it about achieving its target for inflation
(or some other nominal variable)12. Everything still turns out okay eventually, but the
route can be a bit bumpy.
Experiments of that kind can help policymakers to think through, in a disciplined way,
what might happen if inflation expectations were to become dislodged. But, so far,
they do not do much to help us know what to look for in identifying whether inflation
expectations are in the process of becoming dislodged. We do not know enough
about how households and firms form their expectations – how much forward-

7
looking, how much backward-looking – to be able to model the process rigorously.
That is not part of the ‘information set’ of policymakers in today’s world.
What this underlines is that policymakers may well not be able to rely on their models
to help them terribly much when the stakes are highest; ie when our credibility may be
fragile. They are tools to help us think. But they don’t tell us the answers. Crucially,
we have to make judgments about whether medium-term inflation expectations are, in
fact, securely anchored. We need to resist falling into the trap of thinking that the
nominal side is now, and forever, nicely looked after by some miracle of credibility.
Notwithstanding the extent to which analysis of real economic variables seems to
dominate the pages of most central banks’ published analysis, including the Bank of
England’s, maintaining real aggregate demand in line with supply is not a sufficient
condition for achieving an inflation target; indeed, it would be consistent with any
level of inflation. We absolutely have to attend to indicators of medium-term nominal
trends. That is why central bankers like me look at measures of inflation expectations
from as many sources as we can: bond markets, surveys etc. And it is why the ECB
and others, including at the Bank of England, track the monetary aggregates as a cross
check, a potential amber light alerting us to medium-term risks.
Stabilisation policy and the impracticalities of fine tuning: real-side stuff
That brings me to the second element in the conduct of policy: stabilisation of the
path of demand and output, in order to keep inflation in line with the target over the
cycle, to underline the commitment to medium-term stability, and as something
desirable in its own right.
Well-anchored inflation expectations do make stabilisation policy ‘easier’. When a
credible central bank cuts its interest rate to offset the adverse effects of a shock to
demand, it will not be perceived as trying to raise demand and employment in the
short term (say over the next year or so), at the expense of higher inflation down the
road. Rather it will be understood as trying to avoid deficient demand: as trying to
stimulate demand a bit in the short run in order to bring it back to the economy’s
supply capacity and so, precisely, to maintain inflation in line with its target.

8

For at least this policymaker, however, there is a risk of commentators overstating our
capacity to stabilise demand – understandably perhaps following, in the UK, more
than a decade of fairly steady growth since inflation targeting was introduced.
To be clear, I do believe that we should be able to put behind us the self-inflicted
economy-wide boom and bust that, miserably, characterised the UK economy for a
few decades until the early 1990s13. All too frequently in the past, aggregate demand
was allowed to get out of control, bringing with it, variously, a credit boom, an assetprice bubble and, sooner or later, runaway wage and consumer price inflation.
Belatedly, the monetary authority would slam on the brakes, tipping the economy into
recession. Inflation would then slow.
But that we no longer neglect the inflationary consequences of excess demand does
not mean we can nicely fine tune demand to ensure uninterrupted growth. Why?
I will mention just two reasons. First, we just do not know enough about the
underlying structure and properties of the economy. Quite apart from the change in
monetary regime, the extent and variety of the structural change underway in the real
economy is profound: for example, labour market reform domestically, and the
opening up of labour markets across the European continent, which has materially
increased inward migration to the UK; the new technology and the price transparency
it brings; China and India. In consequence, in the UK for the moment we do not
really know whether the short-run trade off between excess (or deficient) demand and
inflation has changed; whether the short-run Phillips curve has become flatter.
Second, the data we use give us an unavoidably imperfect read on what is going on. Not
infrequently in my experience we debate the various possible explanations for some puzzle in
the data, only to find that a year or so later the data have been revised and, as it turned out,
there was no puzzle. For that reason, the Bank of England is putting considerable resources
into researching data uncertainty14.
Where does that leave us? I should like to say that we can ‘rough tune’ but not fine tune.
Rough tuning is important, as we do need to keep aggregate demand and supply broadly in

9
line as a condition for maintaining stable inflation. But that does not mean that we can
always smooth out quarter-to-quarter, or even year-to-year, fluctuations in demand and
output to the extent some commentary implies. In terms of the political economy of
monetary policy making, it is important for the central banking community to get that across
and accepted. If we fail in doing so, and the public believes that central banks can deliver
more than is realistic, there will at some point down the road be disappointment, conceivably
putting in jeopardy the real achievements of monetary policy in delivering price stability.
Of course, these strictures apply most of all to ourselves. We try to discipline ourselves not
to claim too much credit for stable growth. And in forecasting, we have to attend to the
uncertainties around our projections of the central outlook. Some numbers may serve to
underline that. The MPC’s projections are published as fan charts. The fan-chart standard
deviation of output growth at around one year is a little under one percentage point; and of
inflation at around two years, roughly 0.5 percentage points. This is not a world in which
one should get carried away by fine judgments that alter the central projection for demand by
0.1 or 0.2 percentage points. Yet, as the Bank has documented,15 assuming that credibility is
maintained, the effect of a surprise change in the official interest rate, is judged to be small;
maybe less than 0.1 percentage point on the annual rate of inflation two years after a 25bp
surprise change maintained for one year. Of course, we are not in fact in the business of
aiming to make surprise changes in our policy rate. Against a background of credibility, a lot
of practical monetary policy making is not about forestalling major lurches in the economy
and inflation via large, abrupt changes in the policy rate. Instead, it has to involve careful
analysis of the conjuncture, with transparency to the market. But these numbers do perhaps
illustrate the importance of our not getting drawn into absurd degrees of detail, and the risk of
signalling that we think we can precisely fine tune demand conditions.
How can we maintain and underpin credibility? The following seem to be ingredients.
Being very publicly committed to anchoring medium-term inflation expectations in line with
a clear target, above all else. Inflation outturns being, on average, in line with the target.
And being seen to be committed to the essentially technical job of professional economic
analysis of conjunctural conditions and the underlying structure of the economy. Typically
moving our policy rate in steps of 25 bp seems to have been useful in conveying the break
with the past. Perhaps because it conveys that things are ‘under control’. The counterpart to

10
that is being understood to be ready to do whatever it is necessary to maintain well-anchored
inflation expectations.

Policy strategy, risk management, and communication
If the key tasks are anchoring inflation expectations and, with less weight, stabilising demand
conditions, how do central banks go about their policy job?
At the Bank of England, in both our published projections and our policy decisions, we
emphasise the risks around the ‘central outlook’. And although some of the presentation is
different, that is on the same page as what former Chairman Greenspan called the ‘risk
management’ approach to policy.
In my experience, it is not sensible to respond to all possible risks, even some that would
have a big impact if they crystallised. Take, for example, global imbalances. If they were to
unravel abruptly, with a big fall in the dollar against the euro, aggregate demand in the euro
area might fall for a while. Depending on what had happened to sterling’s bilateral exchange
rates, the UK would not be immune from spillovers, as the euro area is by far our largest
trading partner. For some time, therefore, global imbalances have been a real source of risk
to the UK as well as to the global economy. Should I have been voting to cut interest rates to
head off those risks? I don’t think so. It would not have made sense to try to anticipate the
effects of a shock that had not yet occurred and over which we had effectively no influence.
A number of external ‘tail risks’ are rather like that.
How does that fit with ‘precautionary’ or ‘insurance’ policy settings. Individual
policymakers differ on the usefulness of this concept. I find it quite useful. But on my view
of what it means, it has to be subject to some quite stringent conditions in practice.
Remembering that we have a highly imperfect line of sight of what is going on in the
economy, assume as a thought experiment that some indicators are flashing the possibility
that there has been a material shock to demand. For example, imagine that there has been a
bit of bad news but that there are signs that consumer confidence may be ebbing away by
more than we would have guessed was proportionate. So maybe spending will fall

11
materially. The probability is thought to be low, but tangible. In other words, most likely the
outlook is fine, but it might not be. A cut in rates might be warranted in order to guard
against the consequences if the risk has, in fact, crystallised. The policymaker could wait for
more evidence, but by waiting they risk being too late to avoid some deviation of output from
‘potential’ and of inflation from target. This is not a free lunch. In keeping with the
insurance metaphor, a premium will have to be paid: in the form of accepting a slightly
higher probability of inflation rising above target in the near term if the (insured-against) risk
has not, in fact, crystallised. In other words, the policymaker faces a trade off, based on a
judgment of probabilities and costs.
But, in my view, there is more to it than that. Communication matters too. If the
policymaker takes out the insurance, they need to be clear (with themselves) about the
conditions under which it would be withdrawn, ie the cut reversed. And that state-contingent
policy analysis needs to be communicated to the market too.
Some economists do not like the idea of ‘insurance’ policy settings, and ask, reasonably, how
they square with the type of objective (loss) function I set out at the beginning of my
remarks. Alternatively, it is argued that they are so obviously consistent with a ‘standard’
loss function that it does not really add anything to talk about ‘insurance’ or ‘precautionary’
settings as a way of framing policy analysis and decisions. These are both fair points!
Possible responses run as follows. First, maybe we (society) are more averse to fairly bad
events than to risks that take us just a little distance from target/potential; eg maybe
preferences would be better approximated by a loss function with a ‘higher power’ than a
quadratic16. Second, maybe what is going on can be thought of in terms of how heavily or
not we discount future deviations from target/potential relative to very near-term deviations;
ie a policymaker may accept the price (premium) of risking slightly higher/lower inflation in
the nearish term in order to reduce (insure against) the risk of a bigger or more persistent
deviation of inflation from target a little down the road.
What the insurance/risk management metaphor does illustrate is that a policymaker has to
think beyond the immediate policy decision. Indeed, it would be odd not to. In the great
scheme of things, fixing the overnight rate for the next month (in the UK) – or 45 days or so
(in the US) – seems neither here nor there.

12
Of course, on both sides of the Atlantic, we have recent examples of policymakers making
their strategy clear, albeit in subtly different ways. In the most recent cycle, the Bank of
England’s rate troughed at 3.5%. Some of us made it clear that, so far as our individual
decisions were concerned, we expected, other things being equal, to vote for a gradual
withdrawal of monetary accommodation if/as demand recovered and the slack in the
economy was gradually absorbed.17 Crucially, those statements were state contingent.
Some policy strategy issues
Against that background, I should like briefly to review, without reaching firm conclusions
on, four issues that feature in the recent literature. Whether central banks should publish an
expected (optimal) path for their policy rate. Second, whether stabilisation policy is subject
to a bias, meaning that a central bank will find it optimal not to deliver on promises and that,
in consequence, its policies to offset shocks will be less effective than they could be if it
could commit itself. Third, whether stabilisation policy could be more effective if the central
bank targeted a path for the price level rather than an inflation rate. And, fourth, how central
banks should respond to asset price inflation.
(a)

Should central banks publish an expected policy path?

Amongst others, Lars Svensson18 and Michael Woodford have argued that central banks
should publish the path they expect for the policy rate or the near-term path of inflation they
are aiming for. The Norwegian and New Zealand central banks have been publishing policyrate paths for a short while.19 The Bank of England does not. What do I – let me stress,
personally – think about that?
As others have pointed out, managing a scheme for voting by nine members on a path of
rates would be pretty complex. Proposals have been made (eg for deriving a median path
from individual members’ paths)20, but they seem to entertain the possibility of shifting
majorities for different parts of the resulting path (or implied money market curve). That
may add an extra complication to explaining policy.
Indeed, more broadly, there would probably be a challenge in the area of communication. A
single path for rates would, of course, be a misleading statement of the policymaker’s

13
intentions; of its ‘reaction function’. The path policy takes will depend, very obviously, on
the shocks that hit the economy in the future. But not only on that. Also on whether, even
in the absence of new shocks affecting households and firms, the economy evolves on the
path the central bank expected, including agents’ responses to past policy decisions and
shocks. On any changes in view about how the economy works (about the ‘model’). And it
will depend on whether the central bank’s beliefs about agents’ inflation expectations are
(broadly) accurate. In other words, the outlook for policy is unavoidably state contingent,
and those contingencies include the possibility of the policymaker discovering that it had not
been as credible as it had assumed. Communicating that state contingency in the form of a
series of interest-rate paths would be formidably difficult. It is not obvious to me that a fan
chart for the interest rate delivers this21 unless accompanied by a clear explanation of what
states of the world would take the central bank’s rate to different parts of the fan. So the
question boils down to how the policymaker’s reaction function can best be conveyed.
At the Bank of England, we have tackled this by publishing as complete an account as we
can of our analysis of the economic outlook, including the risks. In the minutes of our
meetings, we describe how those risks feature in our policy judgments. And individually, we
explain the reasoning behind our decisions and our view of the outlook in Select Committee
appearances, speeches, etc. The underlying question here is whether a more effective
communication policy is based on explaining the underlying analysis or on providing what
many might wrongly perceive to be the ‘answer’ in the form of a path for rates. In a world
where attention to our analysis is limited, it may be preferable to keep our ‘audience’ focused
on the MPC’s analysis of the outlook for output and inflation.
Sometimes that analysis lends itself naturally to a contingent statement, by individual
members, of a possible path for policy. I have already referred to one such example around
the end of 2003/beginning of 2004.
In a similar vein, circumstances may arise where we explained the broad path for inflation we
were trying to deliver. For example, a shock to the economy might be sufficiently nasty that
returning inflation to target on the usual timetable would threaten undesirable volatility in
output. We might then want to set policy in a way that accepted deviations from the inflation
target for a period, while committing to achieve the target in the medium run. Related to
that, our mandate makes specific provision for communication if inflation outturns were to

14
miss our target of 2% by more than one percentage point. In those circumstances, the
Governor of the Bank would be obliged, as part of the Committee’s public accountability, to
write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why inflation had deviated
from target, the Committee’s plan for returning to target, and its time horizon for doing so.
Such circumstances have not yet arisen, but they illustrate that provision is made for the
Committee to explain what commentators would call its strategy.
The debate is certainly interesting, and it should go without question that, like policymakers
everywhere, I am very much in learning mode over these issues.
(b)

Is there a stabilisation bias?

Inflation targeting has been characterised as ‘constrained discretion’ in the sense that the
central bank makes policy choices, but choices disciplined by a clear objective.22
Exploring the implications of discretion, Michael Woodford and Lars Svensson have argued,
in a series of papers23, that optimal policy suffers from a stabilisation bias, arising from time
inconsistency. Any central banker’s ears will prick up at this, given the importance of an
earlier literature – associated with Kydland & Prescott, Barro, Fischer24 – in helping to
explain the inflation problems of the past and to make the case for central bank
independence.

The ‘old’ problem was about the incentive of a monetary authority to cheat, or renege
on promises, by generating surprise inflationary booms in order to secure an increase
in output and jobs. This was, indeed, pretty tempting for politicians when they had
their hands on the interest rate lever. In a rational world, the result was no permanent
increase in jobs but a higher-than-desired steady-state rate of inflation. And the
solutions variously offered by the academy included appointing a ‘conservative
central banker’ more averse to inflation than society at large, or writing a ‘contract’
that incentivises the monetary authority to do the right thing25.

In practice, the solution has amounted to a combination of central bank independence,
clear goals, and transparency. These real-world central bankers care about ensuring
that nominal magnitudes do not distort economic decision taking, and they care about

15
their reputations. But they are not ‘conservative’ in the sense of being ‘inflation
nutters’. Rather they are ‘dutiful’ in the sense of sticking to a clear, symmetric
mandate. That, many would argue, has been a necessary condition for achieving
credibility.

But now it is argued that a monetary authority does, after all, still have an incentive to
cheat. This time, not on its delivery of price stability in line with a target over the
medium-to-long run, but rather in how it stabilizes shorter-run fluctuations in demand
and inflation in the face of shocks.
As I understand it, broadly the argument runs as follows. Assume that a shock to
costs hits the economy; the oil price rise over the past couple of years might be the
kind of thing. In the short-run, demand and output will be pushed below the
economy’s ‘trend’ path, and inflation above the authority’s target. In the story, to
bring inflation back to target, the central bank raises its policy rate and announces that
it will keep it higher for a while. Because it is believed, near-term inflation
expectations drop back in line with the target. That being so, in order to avoid ‘lost’
output, it is now optimal for the central bank to reduce its policy rate back to where it
was, ie not to leave it higher. The central bank has therefore not done what it said it
would do; it has been time inconsistent. And, reflecting rational/model-consistent
expectations, agents allow for this, so that central bank stabilisation policy is not as
potent as it could be if credible commitments were feasible.
For this practitioner at least, the story does not sound very much like reality. Unlike
the inflation problems of the past, it is not obvious to me that we are going about
breaking promises about how we conduct cyclical policy. I do not mean that in the
trivial sense that we do not publish an intended path for rates, and so there is no
promise to break. Rather, I do not believe that we have published analyses of the
economic outlook that, notwithstanding the absence of news, we have subsequently
deliberately junked – and so abandoned as an input to our policy judgments – when it
suited us in order to secure a ‘better’ path for output. For example, I have mentioned
how in late 2003/early 2004, some MPC members explained that, if the economy
continued to recover, we expected to vote for a gradual withdrawal of monetary
accommodation. If the economy had been knocked off course, speaking for myself I

16
would not have had any difficulty in referring back to my earlier statements and
explaining how things had changed. It would have been the obvious thing to do. That
would not have involved breaking a promise; and I do not think it would have been
misunderstood.
Perhaps more important than that, the model world in the stabilisation-bias story
seems to be better than reality in one key respect, and therefore to miss something
rather central to the policy maker’s job. In the face of a major cost (or supply) shock,
the big question is whether, as well as a temporary upward impetus to inflation, there
will be ‘second-round’ effects via wage earners trying to recover lost purchasing
power. In other words, the big issue is whether medium-term inflation expectations
will remain anchored; or more graphically, whether the central bank will ‘lose
control’. I think we can see that in the statements of central banks from a whole host
of countries over the past year or so. The statements amounted to saying: “if it looks
as though second-round effects are occurring, and creeping into rising medium-term
inflation expectations, then I shall have to – and believe me, I shall – tighten policy.”
If the central banker’s commitment to do so is believed – ie if it is credible – then it
does not have to tighten policy for that reason. It is a state-contingent policy stance.
And the central bank behaves time consistently.
Unless we are passing each other in the night, a possible explanation for the difference
between my practitioner’s view and the time-consistency problem in the model
economy is that the latter assumes model-consistent expectations. In the model
economy, the monetary authority’s ability to deliver, and its will to stick to, its
inflation target over the medium run is never in any doubt. Whereas what it feels like,
at least to me, is that that kind of credibility needs to be earned and re-earned, over
and over again. That does not make us ‘inflation nutters’: the target is symmetric.
But maintaining well-anchored medium-term inflation expectations is not guaranteed.
And, therefore, credibility is not to be taken for granted in the way we seek to
stabilize the path of the economy in the face of shocks. At its broadest, in a world
where medium-to-long-term inflation expectations are anchored principally by virtue
of the central bank conducting policy consistent with the declared regime, the
policymaker has little incentive to ‘cheat’ on stabilisation policy. That is because
developing a reputation for being time inconsistent on that part of its task would risk a

17
perception that it would be time inconsistent on achieving the inflation target over the
medium run. In other words, it would risk undermining the credibility of the regime.
A potential area for research is whether a ‘stabilization bias’ problem would reappear
in models that combine central bank discretion with persistent deviations of mediumterm expectations from target stemming from imperfect or gradual learning by
households and firms about the authority’s long-term objectives and its commitment
to them.
(c)

Would price-level targeting make stabilisation policy more effective?

It is occasionally argued that stabilisation policy would be more effective if central
banks targeted the price level rather than a rate of inflation. That need not mean a flat
price level. It might mean that the central bank committed to deliver a path for the
price level with a positive rate of inflation on average. The difference from today’s
inflation targeting would be that bygones would not be allowed to be bygones. A
period of overshooting would be followed by a period of undershooting, and vice
versa26.
Assuming complete credibility, this would mean that following an adverse demand
shock, households and firms would expect sufficient policy stimulus to plug the gap
left by deficient demand and, on top of that, to generate a little excess demand in
order to raise inflation above its average and so bring the price level back to its
targeted path. The consequent rise in near-term inflation expectations would, it is
argued, make the job of offsetting the initial adverse shock somewhat easier.
I wonder, though, whether price-level targeting might, in fact, endanger credibility by
the extra complication it would bring to the formation of inflation expectations.
When asked about what rate of inflation we are trying to deliver over the long run or
cyclical horizons, the MPC’s answer is virtually always the same: 2% on the CPI
(potentially departing from that only on rare occasions when, after a major supply/cost
shock, we wanted to get inflation back to target more gradually than usual). With
price-level targeting, the de facto near-term target would regularly vary according to
(recent) inflation outturns and the time horizon for offsetting them.

18
That might confuse households and firms about the long-term objective, making it
more difficult for the central bank to maintain credibility. By repeating an
unchanging and simple message about the inflation rate we are aiming at (2%), we
may make it easier for households to learn about our aims.
(d)

How should central banks respond to asset prices?

Others argue that whether the central bank targets consumer price inflation or the
price level, they should also target asset prices. On this question, I subscribe to much
of the current orthodoxy27.
Of course, changes in asset prices feed into policy making as they are an important
influence on demand conditions, through households’ wealth, firms’ cost of capital,
and the price (exchange rate) at which we trade with other economies.
But I do not believe we should use interest rates to target asset prices alongside
consumer price inflation. In the first place, we just do not know enough about the
determination of asset prices – especially of risk premia – to have much of an idea
about what price to target. Big moves in asset prices do occasionally occur because of
changes in the underlying economic fundamentals. We could not be relied upon to
distinguish between those benign changes and bubbles. But even if we could, I don’t
see how in practice we could use our single instrument (the overnight interest rate) to
target both consumer price inflation and asset prices – especially when one
remembers that there are lots of different asset prices and that questions of
disequilibria about them may run in different directions.
Having said that, there is no denying that asset prices can be a serious complication
for monetary policy. And I think I would want to register just a slight qualification to
a strong version of the proposition that the central bank should simply – as if it could
be simple – ‘mop up’ after a bubble has burst. Policymakers need to take care that the
measures they take to offset the impact on aggregate demand of one type of imbalance
unravelling do not themselves create or exacerbate imbalances elsewhere in the
economy, including in other asset markets. In other words, policymakers need to
guard against one imbalance leading to another.

19
That view is, I believe, quite consistent with inflation targeting. The simple set up I
described in my introductory remarks had two relevant features. First, the
policymaker’s objective (or loss) function was set as a quadratic in inflation and
output. And as I described, that can be unpacked as caring about both systematic
biases from the target and the volatility of inflation.
Second, the policymaker cares not just about today (or tomorrow) but about the
future.
Putting these two features of the objective function together, the policymaker places
some weight on the prospect of unusual volatility in inflation down the road. This is
not just hypothetical. In 2002-03, some of us on the MPC voted to maintain an
unchanged policy rate rather than cut partly on the grounds that, by stoking the
embers under household debt and house prices, too great a risk would be taken with
future output and, most important, inflation variability28. Speaking for myself, that
was directed at avoiding policy settings that, on balance, could have increased
uncertainty about demand conditions and inflation in the future, and complicated the
operation of policy down the road, not on some spurious aspiration of steering asset
prices along some (unknowable) equilibrium path.
Maybe that would be one way, consistent with focussing on a single objective, to
construe the thought-provoking papers that have come out of the Bank for
International Settlements in recent years29. Certainly this is an area where
policymakers still have lots to learn.
Summary
It is next to certain that my views on many of the issues covered in these remarks will
continue to develop as the MPC confronts new challenges. It would be hard to be
serious about policymaking without learning.
But for the time being, two key threads run through what I have said. The first is the
absolutely vital task of anchoring medium-to-long term inflation expectations in line
with a clear target. That just cannot be taken for granted. The second is the
importance of clear and clean communications about objectives. On that front, we
should not kid ourselves that households and firms are studying our every utterance or

20
examining in detail the economy in which they live and work. That points, I think, to
keeping things as straightforward as possible, without glossing over uncertainties and
risks.
The two threads are intertwined. We have a better chance of keeping inflation
expectations anchored to the target if the target is simple to communicate; and if we
do not over elaborate, or slip in to being overly ambitious about, our conduct of
cyclical policy.

poor inflation record in recent decades, one key factor was poor institutional arrangements. Monetary
policy, if set correctly, should be a stabilising force for the economy. However, serious mistakes were
made, which often meant that inflation was higher and more volatile than it would otherwise have been.
This, in turn, created substantial economic instability that harmed the long-term performance of the UK
economy. Many of these policy mistakes were made because the aims and procedures of monetary
policy were not properly defined’.
