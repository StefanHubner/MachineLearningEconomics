BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION: STILL RISING. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
THE FUTURE OF CASH?
It is a great pleasure to be the keynote speaker at Banknote 2009. I want to use my time today to
consider the implications of developments in banknote circulation for the future of cash. In
particular, I am going to examine what I regard as the apparent paradox of banknotes, namely that
the value of notes in circulation continues to rise, while the evidence we have suggests that the
use of banknotes as a payment mechanism is declining gently, not I should say dramatically. I am
going to illustrate this using our experience of Bank of England banknotes. There are three parts
to my remarks. I am going to begin by describing trends in banknote circulation and use. Then I
will consider the paradox in these trends. Finally, I will draw out some key challenges that we
face in managing the circulation of Bank of England notes. Let me say at the outset that my very
clear objective in terms of Bank of England notes is to maintain the integrity of our banknotes,
and an important part of that is meeting the public demand. I am not trying to promote or kill our
notes.
The trends in banknote circulation and use
I am going to talk about trends in banknote circulation in the context of the roles of money, as a
medium of exchange (payments) and a store of value. Chart 1 illustrates the pattern of the total
value of Bank of England notes in circulation over the last forty years. The striking thing is the
acceleration of growth over the last fifteen years. This may come as something of a surprise to
the ‘cash is dead’ lobby. This chart suggests that nothing could be further from the truth. The
total value of our circulation was around £15bn in the mid 1990s, while today it is around £45bn.
As the chart also shows, this increase can for the most part be attributed to one denomination, the
£20 note.

But it is important to put this increase in notes in circulation into context. Chart 2 does this by
plotting the value of notes in circulation as a share of the nominal GDP of the UK, again over the
last forty years. What we now see is a decline in the value of notes from 6% of nominal GDP in
1970 to a low point of 2.4% in the mid-1990s. Since then, there has been a stabilisation and small
increase, followed by a noticeable increase over the last two years, to 3.2% of nominal GDP. We
can tell a story about inflation in the UK economy to explain the long-run trend. The decline in
the stock of notes in circulation relative to nominal GDP came in the high inflation period of the
1970s, running on into the early 80s. As inflation erodes the value of the currency, the incentive
to hold banknotes declined markedly in a period of high inflation. Likewise, this was a period
that saw a marked decline in the use of cash for wage payments. The move to an environment of
low inflation has subsequently stabilised that situation.

This pattern of the note issue as a percentage of nominal GDP reveals that something quite
noticeable has happened over the last two years. Chart 3 focuses on this development by plotting
the course of the note issue to GDP percentage over the recessions of the early 1980s and early
1990s and the current experience. The contrast of the current experience is striking. Two
features of the current situation strike me as most relevant in explaining this development: first,
lower levels of public confidence in the banking system; and second, very low interest rates
which thereby reduce the opportunity cost of holding banknotes (as a non-interest bearing asset).

I should add two important points at this stage. First, my understanding is that this pattern over
the last two years is reflected in other major currencies. Second, as I will come back to later,
banknotes are central-bank money in a form that can be held by the public, in other words the
retail equivalent of reserve accounts at the central bank, the latter being wholesale central-bank
money. Banknotes are therefore a non-interest bearing store of value. In the current recession,
the demand for banknotes has risen, and it is likely that this reflects demand for central-bank
money as a store of value. We can add some further evidence to support this story by looking at
the pattern of behaviour of the various denominations of Bank of England notes. We issue four
denominations - £5, £10, £20 and £50. Chart 4 shows the growth rate of each denomination over
the last nearly four years. The striking feature of this chart is the growth rate of the highest
denomination note, the £50, which had picked up from the onset of the financial crisis in the
summer of 2007, and then rose further from last autumn, in the wake of the failure of Lehman.
Since the summer of 2007, the total value of our £50 notes in circulation has risen from £7bn to
£9bn. Again, I believe this is a pattern seen in the high denomination notes of other currencies.
Chart 5 shows the same story, but this time expressing it in terms of the contribution of each
denomination to overall growth. The yellow contribution shows the role of the £50. This strikes
me as pretty good prima facie evidence that there has been an increase in demand for banknotes
as a store of value.

So far, I have told the story of trends in demand for banknotes over the last forty years in terms
more of the macroeconomics of demand for notes as central bank money. Now I want to turn to
the more micro elements of banknote use. The first thing to say here, as Chart 6 illustrates, is that
over the last twenty years there has been a major change in the method of distributing banknotes
to the public. At the start of the 1990s there were under 20,000 ATMs in the UK, whereas now
the number is over 60,000. Since the beginning of the current decade, the major growth has been
among the independent ATM deployers, as opposed to financial institution operated machines.

And as Chart 7 shows, ATM withdrawals now account for around 70% of all cash acquisitions by
individuals in the UK, compared with 25% in the early 1990s. We can all observe around us the
growth of the ATM industry, but it is worth considering how influential it has been on the
circulation of banknotes. First, the rise of the ATM has fundamentally changed and modernised
the distribution of what is sometimes regarded as an old-fashioned means of payment. Second, it
is likely that the growth of ATMs may have led to an increase in notes in circulation for another
reason.

When we talk to ATM operators about their business model they stress that the least acceptable
outcome is for their ATMs to run out of notes. As a consequence, ATMs are re-stocked well
before they run out. This means that the overall ATM estate is holding what could be described
as idle inventory stock, but these are defined as notes in circulation. But I should be clear that I
don’t have enough evidence to prove to you that the stock:output ratio for banknotes has gone up,
which would run counter to the story in almost all other industries.
I want to move on now to trends in cash usage (I am using “cash” here to mean banknotes and
coin). Chart 8 shows survey evidence for the use of cash in retail transactions in the UK over the
last 25 years. In terms of the share of the total volume of transactions, cash has fallen from over
80% in the mid 1980s to 60% currently. In value terms, cash accounted for around 9% of all
retail transactions in the early 1990s, whereas it is around 4% currently. Cash is generally used
for small-value transactions. The latest evidence suggests that the average value of a cash
transaction is around £9, with 93% of payments under £5 being made in cash. One in five adults
in the UK report that they use only cash for day-to-day transactions, with this group heavily
focused on teenagers/young adults and the elderly. The survey evidence also indicates that more
credit-constrained individuals prefer to use cash, as a budgeting tool based, I think, on the
principle that with cash you can only spend what you have.

The paradox of banknotes
This quick survey of trends in banknote demand and use leaves us with what I regard as the
paradox of banknotes. The total value of Bank of England banknotes in circulation continues to
rise, but their use in transactions is falling gradually. To recap, I have put forward some
arguments that seek to explain this paradox. From a macroeconomic perspective, sustained low
inflation has increased confidence in the real value of the currency, while more recently demand
for banknotes has risen during this recession, and particularly for high denomination notes,
reflecting loss of confidence in banks, and very low interest rates. ATMs have changed banknote
issuance. And, banknote use is more concentrated among the young, the elderly, and those on
low incomes. I would add one other thought on the demand for banknotes, which is more to do
with human psychology. I suspect most people, however much they use cards, feel a degree of
comfort from knowing that they also have cash in their wallet or purse, even if it is as a back-up.
What does this analysis tell us about future demand for cash? As a central bank responsible for
the issuance of banknotes, two principles are at the front of our thinking: first, that we issue
central bank money, in the form of claims on the Bank of England; and second, that in doing so
we must meet the public’s demand for our notes. By issuing central-bank money, we are
providing both a means of payment and a store of value.
But I think we should recognise that the paradox of banknotes that I have described indicates that
there may well be a limit to the growth of the value of notes in circulation insofar as the use of
banknotes as a means of payment is not increasing. This is, though, a broad assessment, and I
would not wish to offer a judgment on the level at which the demand of the public to hold more
banknotes will peak. An important reason for this uncertainty is that, as recent experience
indicates, the demand for banknotes as a store of value is dependent on the state of the economy
and the financial system. This is a challenge for central banks because we have to manage our
own contingency stocks based on a view of likely future demand. This is something to which
central banks have had to devote more attention over the last two years.
What does it mean to meet the public’s demand for banknotes
I want to turn now to considering what it means to meet the public’s demand for our banknotes. I
take this very seriously, with the principle that the public knows best what it wants in terms of
what it requires from its banknotes.
I think it is reasonable to say that, in the past, meeting the public’s demand for notes was for most
part focused on ensuring that the value of notes demanded was available. At the Bank of England
we have outsourced much of our role in note distribution for 27 years and our note distribution
schemes have been designed around the objective of meeting public demand for a value of notes.
There is nothing at all wrong with this objective; indeed, it is the heart of what we do on note
8

distribution. But increasingly, we are trying to meet two other objectives as well: maintaining a
satisfactory physical quality of our notes in circulation, and meeting the public’s demand for
different denominations, ie the denominational mix.
There are two developments which stand out for me in terms of the physical quality of notes.
First, modern ATMs can more safely dispense notes of a physical quality that as the issuing
authority I would not wish to see in circulation (for example, heavily soiled notes). This is a
mundane point, but the latest ATMs are harder to jam, unlike their predecessors. On the whole,
financial institutions do not dispense what we regard as unfit notes, even though their ATMs
might be able to do so, but as the issuing authority we now have to pay more attention to ensuring
that this does not happen. The second development represents the connection between the
physical quality of notes and denominational mix. We have most difficulty getting our low
denomination note, the £5, into circulation. The main reason for this problem is that few ATMs
dispense £5s. The link to quality comes about because once our £5s enter circulation, they stay in
circulation and exchange hands more times before they return into the wholesale cash distribution
system for fitness sorting, and thus can be taken out of circulation as unfit or re-circulated as a fit
note. Put simply, since there are relatively few £5 notes entering circulation they stay in
circulation and are not banked and fitness sorted as regularly as they should be. Chart 9 illustrates
this problem. It shows over the last nearly fifteen years the trend in how many times per year on
average banknotes of each denomination are processed through the wholesale cash centre fitness
sorting process. The intuition we think is that the lowest value note should be sorted most often,
and the highest value note least often. The reason for this order is that the lowest value note will
be nearest to a pure transactional instrument, and the highest value note nearest to a pure store of
value instrument. As the chart indicates, the intuition holds for all denominations except the £5.
On average, at £10 note passes through a cash centre for sorting nine times a year, a £20 four and
a half times, and a £50 just under once a year. But the £5 has seen a decline from five times a
year in the mid-1990s to one and a half times a year now. This goes a long way to explain the
problem we have with the £5. We need to see more dispensed so that they are less scarce and
therefore they return to cash centres for sorting more often.

In the last few years we have had some success in increasing the total number of £5s in
circulation. The overall value of £5s in circulation had been stuck at around £1bn since the early
1990s. In the last two years it has risen to £1.3bn. But the evidence from turnover indicates that
we have a lot more to do. Recently, we have therefore run two pilot schemes. One is with a
major bank, which has agreed to stock a proportion of its ATMs with £5s and examine what
affect this change would have on its cash business. The results to date suggest that the business
case for stocking some ATMs with £5s is stronger than previously thought.
At the same time, we have carried out a second pilot study. This has been focused on the business
case for major retailers ordering more £5s to use as change. A major supermarket chain has
conducted a trial which involves supplying more £5s to many of its stores. Again, the results
appear to have been a success. Using more £5s as change has appeared to slightly speed up the
overall processing of payments at the checkout and appears to be well received by customers.
I am very grateful to HSBC and Sainsbury’s for their help with these two pilots. In the New Year
I hope and expect that we will take these examples to other financial institutions and major
retailers to make the case for a change of policy towards issuing £5s. This is important because
my assessment is that there is a good deal of aversion among the commercial sector to change in
this area. Yet our evidence suggests that the public wants more of them and of a better quality.
To achieve that objective we need to see more £5s dispensed from ATMs and by retailers in
change. With the results of these two pilot exercises, I think we have the evidence to press the
case for raising the dispense of £5s, and we will do this alongside reviewing our distribution
scheme to ensure that the incentives for note distribution are properly aligned across the
denominations.
10

The story of the £5 illustrates the growing importance of denominational mix in our note
distribution policy. We want to work with the commercial sector to ensure that the public’s
demand for a balanced denominational mix of notes is met.
In conclusion, notes are a big business for central banks. They are high profile in the eye of the
public. There is an apparent paradox in that the value of notes in circulation has been rising year
after year at the same time that evidence suggests that the use of notes to pay for transactions is
declining. I have offered some explanations for this paradox which highlight that banknotes are
also a store of value since they are central bank money. But at the same time the objectives of our
central bank distribution scheme have grown in number to embrace the physical quality of notes
in circulation and the denominational mix. The last of these – denominational mix – poses the
biggest challenge, but in the UK I believe we now have evidence to support the business case for
ATM and retailer dispense of £5s.
And, finally, I am sometimes asked why this matters to the Bank of England? After all, I can
assure you that in the current financial conditions we are not short of difficult challenges. The
answer is simple. We should not forget that our job is to ensure that confidence in our currency is
maintained – and crucial to that is satisfying the public’s demand for our notes.
