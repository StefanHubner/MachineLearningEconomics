In this speech I will focus on recent developments in the evolution of the pandemic and how these affect the
outlook for the economy and monetary policy.

1. The current economic situation

The economy has been on an extraordinary trajectory since the start of last year, and it is important not to
lose sight of where we are. After falling by about 25% last spring, GDP recovered sharply over the summer,
but has stagnated since the late autumn, and has probably fallen outright at the start of this year. In
December, the latest available data, GDP was just under 7% below its level of 2019 Q4. Compared with the
evolution of GDP in the financial crisis (see Chart 1), we are still only at levels comparable with the trough of
the financial crisis. Our expectation is that the recovery will be more rapid than it was then, as illustrated by
the red diamonds showing our February central projection. I will discuss that in more detail in a moment. But
for now I want to emphasise how far we still have to travel in this recovery.

A second perspective on the evolution of the economy is the one in Chart 2, showing successive MPC
forecasts since the pandemic began, as well as actual GDP. You can see that we have made forecast errors
in both directions so far. We were too pessimistic initially about the depth to which we thought the economy
would fall. That forecast error was large in historic terms, but small relative to the scale of the shock, as the
chart clearly illustrates. We have made smaller forecast errors in both directions in subsequent periods:
where the economy ended up in 2020 Q4 was exactly in line with our May scenario, but somewhat weaker
than in our August projection, and somewhat stronger than in our November projection.

Consistent with the fact that economic activity is well below its pre-Covid trajectory, the UK’s labour market is
running well below any measure of full employment. In addition to the 800K job losses since the start of the
pandemic (representing around 2 ½ % of the workforce), 20% of the private sector workforce are currently on
furlough.1

When discussing economic cycles, I think numbers are more informative than letters. But for those who
insist, in the lexicon of recovery shapes2 we are experiencing something between a swoosh-shaped recovery
and a W-shaped recovery, as Chart 2 shows. We are clearly not experiencing a V-shaped recovery.

2. News since our November projection

Since our November projection, there have been three major developments that relate to Covid and its
impact on the economy. We are learning to cope, we have vaccines, and we have variants.

By learning to cope, I mean that for a given level of social restrictions, the economy appears to be able to
operate at a higher level than in the first lockdown. As I said a moment ago, the level of GDP in Q4 was
higher than we projected in November. In part this was due to more firms being able to continue operating
within the health-related restrictions, contributing to a less severe drag on consumption than in the first
lockdown. Despite that improved ability to cope, consumption in Q4 was still 9% below its level a year earlier.

In December, the latest period for which we have monthly GDP data, an average of 12% of the private sector workforce were on
furlough. This has subsequently increased to 20% (period 8-16 February).

Chart 3 uses high frequency payments data to gain some perspective on spending developments at the start
of this year. It suggests that in the January lockdown, spending fell below November levels, but remained
above the levels seen in the first lockdown.

The second development since November is that effective vaccines have been created and are being rolled
out successfully. As recently as November last year, we were uncertain whether any successful vaccines
would be found. Now we have several that are approved, and more on the way. Vaccines are being rolled
out particularly quickly in the UK, and that is excellent news for both our health outlook and our economic
outlook. In our central forecast, a successful vaccine rollout allows social distancing restrictions to be lifted in
the coming quarters, and voluntary social distancing is also eased as health concerns fall back significantly.
That is projected to drive rapid economic growth over the course of this year.

The third development is that we are discovering variants, or mutations, of the virus. This is not an unusual
development in any epidemic, and one that scientists have warned us about all along.
The consequence of these mutations is two-fold.

First, the spread of a more infectious variant in the UK late last year has meant that we have needed tighter
social distancing restrictions in recent months to reduce virus spread. The economic recovery expected later
this year will therefore start from a lower level, relative to our November projection, but it is expected to catch
up faster.

Second, some mutations may render the vaccine less effective in terms of reducing infection or transmission.
We have some early indications already of reduced effectiveness of the vaccine in the case of the B.1.351
variant (the variant first detected in South Africa), but further data is needed to understand the changes in
effectiveness with more precision.3 And research is already underway to modify existing vaccines in order to
work better with known variants. What we can say is that variants add downside risk to the success of the
vaccination programme: vaccines may be less effective, may need to be modified (which takes time), and
their impact may be less long-lived than initially hoped. This risks delaying the point at which the economy
can be largely free of social restrictions and voluntary social distancing.

Covid is unlikely to just go away. It will be with us for years. The question, for the MPC, is whether it lingers
as a health risk that does not otherwise affect the economy, and it therefore ceases to be a factor influencing
monetary policy. Alternatively, it could continue to weigh on the economy to some extent, via uncertainty, or
persistently elevated unemployment as the economy reallocates resources away from sectors that are
affected by lingering health risks.

3. The medium-term economic outlook
The main question for the setting of monetary policy is: will demand rise all the way back to the economy’s
medium-term potential, fall somewhat short, or rise above it, temporarily or persistently? These
considerations will be the main driver of underlying inflation pressure, and are the key to ensuring that
inflation returns sustainably to the MPC’s 2% target.

With consumption having fallen far further than aggregate income, a large amount of savings has been
accumulated, in aggregate. In the period between March and November 2020, excess accumulated savings
were estimated to be around £125bn, worth around 8% of annual household income. Significant further
savings are likely to have been accumulated since then, possibly doubling or tripling the accumulated
amount by the middle of this year.
As I have previously discussed,4 the effect of the pandemic on the economy has been unusually uneven. We
are really not all in this together. Some sectors have experienced sharply reduced demand, some have seen
little change, while others have experienced increases in demand. Chart 4 illustrates that these shifts across
sectors have been much larger than in previous economic cycles.

Across households, we have seen a similarly wide dispersion of experiences, illustrated in Chart 5.
Households in the bottom 20%, or bottom quintile, of the income distribution have seen a marked decline in
savings. Households in the next two quintiles have experienced small declines and small increases in
savings respectively. It is mostly households in the top 40% of the income distribution that have experienced
marked increases in savings, as their incomes have been largely maintained while consumption has fallen
sharply.

To what extent these savings will be spent once social restrictions and voluntary social distancing are eased
is highly uncertain. The propensity to spend out of wealth is estimated to be quite small, with international
estimates centred around 5%.5 That would suggest a boost in the level of consumption of around 1 to 1 ½ %,
and this is what is already factored into our February projection.

The propensity to consume out of additional income, rather than wealth, is significantly higher than that, with
estimates ranging from 10% to 50%. But the higher estimates relate to households that have low income or
low liquid assets. The households that have actually accumulated the savings last year have both high
incomes and are likely to have high liquid assets, so would tend to have a lower propensity to spend.
That begs the question: should we consider this unspent income as “additional income” or “additional
wealth”, or something else altogether? A comparison between UK and US income dynamics is instructive,
shown in Chart 6. UK aggregate household income fell slightly in this pandemic – with income largely
protected by the furlough scheme. But it is difficult to argue that the unspent savings represent “additional
income” relative to what households may have been expecting before the pandemic. In the US, on the other
hand, the pandemic stimulus cheques and the increase in unemployment benefits have led to a significant
rise in household income relative to its pre-pandemic trajectory. That can more reasonably be interpreted as
“additional income” for many. Moreover, it has, by design, been spread more evenly across the income
distribution, so for both of these reasons one might expect US households to spend more of the accumulated
savings than UK households.

In any case, the degree to which health risks dissipate later this year will be a key factor in determining to
what extent savings are retained or spent. The more there are lingering health risks and associated
economic uncertainty, the more it is likely that a larger share of the accumulated savings stock will be
retained, and that the desired on-going flow of savings will remain somewhat elevated relative to
pre-pandemic flows.

Given that we have never experienced an economic situation quite like the one we are now in, a wide range
of outcomes are possible. I am genuinely uncertain about this, and it is something that reasonable people
can disagree on. Given the scale of the amounts involved, even small changes in the assumed propensity to
spend out of these accumulated savings lead to large changes in the expected outturns for consumption and
the economy as a whole.

4. Inflation

The pandemic shock was fundamentally a disinflationary shock. Without significant support from fiscal and
monetary policy to help protect jobs, income, credit and confidence, the economic impact on demand would
have been greatly amplified resulting in severe disinflation. It is only thanks to the substantial fiscal and
monetary support that the disinflationary impact is expected to be temporary, and inflation is expected to
return sustainably to target. These are not just our expectations as MPC members, but also the expectations
of external forecasters, as is shown in Chart 7.

Despite the fact that the pandemic shock was clearly disinflationary, the detailed inflation picture that has
emerged in recent months is difficult to interpret, given the large differences in the experience across various
sectors.

A crude summary is that consumption demand has been weak, but within that, services demand has, on
average, been far more affected by social distancing than goods demand. Consistent with that sectoral shift,
we have seen more disinflation in services than in goods. And, as shown in chart 8, this is a pattern that has
been observed in other countries as well. Such large sectoral shifts can lead to temporary price moves that
mask underlying inflation trends, as discussed in detail by my colleague Ben Broadbent6.

Wage data have been similarly difficult to interpret. Here, too, large sectoral shifts have masked underlying
trends. When the jobs lost are disproportionally those at the lower end of the pay scale, the average pay of
the remaining jobs is arithmetically higher. The strength of these compositional effects is difficult to estimate
with precision. But the resulting strength in average pay is clearly not “underlying strength”, because when
the jobs return, the compositional boost will unwind. It is therefore important to form a view based on a range
of pay-related indicators. One such indicator, which, although not particularly timely, has given us reliable
signals in the past about underlying wage growth, is the Agents’ pay settlements survey, shown in Chart 9.
This shows that pay settlements, which had risen to around 3% in the past few years, are expected to fall
back to around 2%, close to where they were in the long period of weak wage growth after the financial
crisis. Other surveys of pay deals give a similar message.

It is important to distinguish these shorter term temporary fluctuations in price and wage data from underlying
inflationary pressures. With the economy and the labour market running so far below its medium-term
potential, we will ultimately need to close that gap to get inflation sustainably back to target.

5. Monetary policy toolkit

Over the past year, the MPC has cut the policy rate to 0.1%, judged to be the effective lower bound (ELB) at
the time, and has announced QE, or asset purchases, of £450bn to ensure that financial conditions were
stimulative enough to return inflation to its 2% target sustainably. For much of last year, both short-term and
long-term interest rates have been close to zero.

To reiterate, the monetary policy response was not there to boost activity beyond safe levels while health
risks remained acute. Rather, the monetary policy response was intended to prevent an unavoidable
economic contraction from becoming unnecessarily amplified due to a high cost or unavailability of credit, a
loss of confidence, and a lack of cash flow, which would in turn have caused unwarranted persistent damage
to the economy.7

I have on many occasions explained my view that QE works primarily through expectations and liquidity
channels, with only small and temporary term premium effects. As a consequence, when long term yields are
already very low (close to the ELB) and there is ample liquidity in markets, there is little QE can do to add
further stimulus to the economy.

I made this point on a few occasions, e.g., see Vlieghe (2020), “Monetary Policy and the Bank of England’s Balance Sheet”, speech
available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2020/gertjan-vlieghe-speech-monetary-policy-and-the-boes-balance-sheet

In the early stages of the pandemic, when market functioning was severely disrupted, the MPC acted quickly
to buy UK government bonds on a large scale, as well as a smaller amount of corporate bonds. At the time,
the QE bond buying pace happened to match, approximately, the pace of government issuance. That in itself
was not a new development. As shown in chart 10, both in 2009 and 2012 the QE buying pace even
exceeded government issuance of gilts. What was unusual last spring was that government issuance itself
was unprecedented, which reflected the unprecedented scale of the economic shock leading to a very large
fiscal response. That same unprecedented economic shock also required a very large monetary policy
response, which the MPC delivered.

Chart 10 also shows that, when market functioning started improving, the QE buying pace slowed
significantly, and is now well below the pace of government issuance. We are not simply buying what the
government is issuing. We are buying much less. This shows clearly that the driving force behind the
decision of how much to buy is what we think we need to buy to return inflation to its target, not how much
the government happens to be issuing.

In the US, we also saw a rapid pace of central bank purchases during the period of market turbulence,
followed by a much lower pace of purchases thereafter, also well below the pace of government issuance,
(shown in Chart 11).

Should market functioning deteriorate again, of course the MPC will not hesitate to accelerate the buying
pace again, if that is appropriate to ensure that financial conditions are consistent with meeting the inflation
target. But absent such a deterioration, and with long term interest rates already very low, we need to look
for tools other than QE to deliver further stimulus if required.

It is therefore an important and welcome development that the MPC will be adding negative interest rates to
its toolkit from August, once banks have made the necessary operational adjustments. The six-month period
for operation readiness was the time frame recommended by the Prudential Regulation Committee.8
The possibility of negative rates, which the MPC started discussing last spring,9 has already been affecting
the yield curve since then. Chart 12 (b) shows that forward interest rates out to five years have regularly
been in negative territory over the past year, representing an amount of stimulus that would not have been
present if we had ruled out negative interest rates. As shown in Chart 12 (a), in previous years, when there
was not a live discussion about the possibility of negative interest rates, the actual level of Bank Rate tended
to act as a lower bound for forward interest rates.

I have previously observed that the question of negative rates can be broken down into whether they are
feasible, effective, and appropriate. From August 2021, negative rates will be feasible.

I also conclude from the large amount of evidence gathered from countries that already have negative
rates,10 that negative rates are effective. That is to say, negative rates stimulate the economy and lending
relative to a counterfactual where rates are not cut any further. Some research papers find cuts into negative
territory as effective as cuts in a positive range, while others find that the effectiveness is slightly reduced.
But there has been no evidence that negative rates have been counterproductive to the aggregate aims of
monetary policy.

There is a theoretical possibility that, below a certain level, further cuts in interest rates do become
counterproductive to the aims of monetary policy.11 That is still possible, but we have seen no evidence that
any country has reached these levels yet. Where these theoretical models have been too pessimistic, in my
view, is in the assumption that deposit demand would shrink rapidly near zero interest rates, because
everyone would want to convert their deposits into paper money to avoid negative interest rates. In practice,
the inconvenience of holding paper money has meant that people are in fact willing to hold a range of assets
with negative nominal rates, including corporate bank deposits, large retail deposits, and wholesale bank
funding instruments. Banks have therefore seen a fall across a wide range of interest rates on their liabilities,
which has allowed them to preserve their interest margin much better than simple models had assumed.

Banks might not pass on the rate cuts in full, but even a partial pass-through would be stimulative.
Importantly, the transmission of monetary policy is much broader than just via the interest rate on bank

As summarised in Tenreyro (2021), “Let’s Talk about Negative Interest Rates”, speech available at:

loans. The cost of market financing (bonds, shares) would fall as normal, the exchange rate would fall as
normal.

The final question then remains in what circumstances negative interest rates are appropriate, meaning
when are they needed in order to return inflation sustainably to target? I will turn to that in the next section.

6. The outlook for monetary policy

I will now discuss some possible outcomes for the economy, and what they might imply for the future stance
of monetary policy.

The MPC published its best collective view of the economic outlook in the February Monetary Policy Report.
This outlook comprises not just a central path for the economy, but a fan chart around that central path
incorporating both upside and downside risks. Moreover, the MPC gave specific guidance on the future
setting of monetary policy in its February Minutes. It is useful to highlight two key sentences: “If the outlook
for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve
its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that
significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target
sustainably”.

What I want to do is to discuss some illustrative scenarios for the economy that fall within the fan chart of the
Monetary Policy Report, and to discuss what my preferred Bank Rate path might look like in each of these
scenarios. The Bank Rate paths I am showing are consistent with the MPC’s guidance, but the guidance
encompasses a wide range of other paths as well. I want to be very clear that these are my own personal
views, and do not represent the view of the MPC. And I emphasise that any future rate path that I discuss is
not a promise, it is my own forecast based on a particular economic scenario.12 If the data turn out differently,
so will the associated rate path.

If the economy evolves broadly in line with our February central projection, then in my view it is likely that no
further monetary stimulus is required. The current stance remains appropriate, and we will just complete the
already announced QE programme. For me the question will then turn to when it becomes appropriate to
remove stimulus. Given how low I think the neutral rate of interest is, there is no hurry at all to remove
stimulus. This view of a low neutral rate is further supported by the fact that, immediately before the
pandemic, our policy rate was just 0.75% and we were discussing whether it should be cut because inflation
pressures were a little too weak. Given these considerations, my preferred path for policy would be to keep
the current monetary stimulus in place until well into 2023 or 2024, long enough to judge whether economic

I have discussed the benefits of providing more clarity in our preferred path before, see Vlieghe (2019), “Continuous improvements in

slack has indeed been eliminated fully, and inflation has returned to target sustainably, rather than being
pushed up by temporary factors.

Stronger economic scenarios are of course possible. More of the accumulated savings could be spent in the
coming years, so that spare capacity is not just eliminated, but the economy moves into excess demand. I
would want to judge whether that excess demand is persistent or not, so I would favour not responding to the
first signs of it, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored. It is perfectly possible that we have a short
period of pent up demand, after which demand eases back again. In my judgement it would be a policy error
to respond to such circumstances with early monetary tightening. Tightening too soon would be a worse
mistake than tightening too late, given that monetary policy space for easing is limited. So even if the
economy recovers more strongly than in our central projection, I think removal of monetary stimulus is
unlikely to become appropriate until well into 2022. Such a strong economic scenario would be a nice
problem for the MPC to have. We have all the policy space we need in order to tighten monetary policy. And
given low neutral interest rates, is likely we would not have to tighten all that much.

There is also the possibility of a weaker scenario, and my own view is that risks remain skewed in this
direction. First, there is the risk that concerns about the virus will linger, in part driven by uncertainty about
future variants, but also by a slower pace of vaccination outside the UK, so that the economic impact of
health risks will be greatly reduced but not eliminated this year. In the words of renowned global health
expert Peter Piot: “The pandemic is not over anywhere until it’s over everywhere”.13 Second, I worry that, as
we transition out of the furlough scheme, some of the furloughed workers will not be seamlessly reintegrated
into the labour market. This transition is to some extent already present in the MPC’s central projection, and
has been for some time. But I worry that the resulting labour market slack will be more persistent and more
disinflationary than in our central projection. Even a small amount of persistent labour market slack would be
enough to keep wage pressure too low, and therefore inconsistent with inflation returning sustainably to
target. In such a scenario, I judge more monetary stimulus would be appropriate, and I would favour a
negative Bank Rate as the tool to implement the stimulus. The time to implement it would be whenever the
data, or the balance of risks around it, suggest that the recovery is falling short of fully eliminating economic
slack, which might be later this year or into next year. After the further boost delivered by negative rates to
eliminate slack, interest rates can begin to return to positive.

These are just some of the possible scenarios, and I am showing them graphically in Chart 13. But I think
they illustrate usefully what sort of timing and magnitude of policy adjustments I would find appropriate in
different circumstances, without committing to them and without any implication that others on the MPC
share these views. As always, the actual policy settings will be determined by how the data evolves, and will
be such that we ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target sustainably.
