Splitting the remaining surplus after a negative ToT shock
• Baseline New Keynesian model: Labour is the only input in the baseline NK
model and the labour market is ‘frictionless.’ The split of the surplus depends on
adjustment frictions, but in the long run the share of 𝑣 𝑠 accruing to workers 𝑣 𝑖
and firms 𝑣 𝑓 is stable. In equilibrium, marginal cost of work equal the marginal
benefit for workers and firms (w wage, Z productivity) …
𝑤𝑡
𝑃𝑡

= 𝑀𝑅𝑆𝑡 and 𝑀𝐶𝑡 =

𝑤𝑡 /𝑃𝑡
𝑍𝑡

• Introducing labour market frictions: Labour market frictions imply workers and
firms need to be ‘matched’, giving rise to a surplus value from a job match split
via a negotiated wage:
𝑣 𝑠 = 𝑣 𝑓 (−𝑤) + 𝑣 𝑖 (𝑤)
• When the real income of the economy declines, for example through a ToT
shock, 𝑣 𝑠 ↓. Under standard Nash bargaining 𝑣 𝑓 and 𝑣 𝑖 decline equally.

• The profit and labour share in value added have remained relatively stable. This
could imply symmetric ‘push and shove’ between labour and capital.

What happens when parties refuse to accept that the real
income implications of ToT shock?
• If both parties – whether these are workers and firms or intermediate and final
𝑓
goods producers – refuse to accept that their respective equilibrium surpluses 𝑣𝑡

and

𝑣𝑡𝑖

have declined and they target past
∗
𝑓∗
𝑣𝑡 +𝑣𝑡𝑖

𝑓∗
surpluses 𝑣𝑡 and

𝑖∗
𝑣𝑡

then …

> 𝑣𝑡𝑠 .

• In this situation, the input sellers target share, 𝛾 ∗ , is increasing in the differential
𝑖∗
between 𝑣𝑡 and 𝑣𝑡𝑖 . A higher 𝛾 ∗ will lead to higher seller price proposals 𝜄∗ …
𝜄∗
= 𝛾 ∗𝑣 𝑠
𝑃

• As long as

𝑓∗
𝑖∗
𝑣𝑡 +𝑣𝑡 >𝑣𝑡𝑠

inflation will persist.

Mechanics of targeting a real surplus that is too high –
creation of ‘push and shove’ inflation
• We assume that total surplus 𝑣 𝑠 produced by a buyer and seller agent in the economy
changes from 𝑣0𝑠 > 𝑣𝑡𝑠 .
• We assume that in response to the decline in the total surplus the buying producers and the
input sellers accept a decline in their real surplus only at rate 𝜌𝑣 . Both agents j then target vj∗ :
∗
∗
vt,j
= 1 − 𝜌𝑣𝑗 vt−1j
+ 𝜌𝑣𝑗 𝛾𝑗 𝑣𝑡𝑠

• Targets input prices 𝜄𝑡∗ and target output prices 𝑝𝑡∗ are set according to the deviation of the
target surplus from the equilibrium surplus, in the following way;
∗
𝜄𝑡∗ = 𝑝𝑡 (1 + (vt,𝑖
−𝛾𝑖 𝑣𝑡𝑠 ))
∗
𝑝𝑡∗ = 𝜄𝑡 (1 + (vt,𝑓
−𝛾𝑓 𝑣𝑡𝑠 ))

• Intuitively, a higher target leads to higher (realised) input price demands 𝜄𝑡∗ . In turn, buying
producers pass the realised higher input price level on to output prices protect their real
surplus.

Mechanics of targeting a real surplus that is too high
• The partial equilibrium model is closed by transmitting targeted prices with
Calvo parameter 𝜆𝑗 to aggregate price levels 𝜄𝑡 and 𝑝𝑡
𝜄𝑡 = 𝜆𝜄 𝜄∗ + 1 − 𝜆𝜄 𝜄𝑡−1
𝑝𝑡 = 𝜆𝑝 𝑝∗ + 1 − 𝜆𝑝 𝑝𝑡−1
• Is a sluggish refusal to accept real surplus declines the same as price frictions?
➢ While the implied dynamics are similar in the response of aggregate prices the
micro foundations and policy implications are fundamentally different: Here
sluggishness to accept 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 inflation.
➢ This sluggishness is by its nature asymmetric and inflation expectations do not
matter as drivers of inflation via this channel. Real income expectations do.

13

Illustrating the dynamics
• In the next slides we show …
➢ A negative ToT shock at time 2
➢ A positive ToT shock at time 26 making up 50% of the negative ToT at time 2
➢ The fourth slide assumes that monetary policy can force a higher speed of
acceptance. Intuitively this may be the result of interest rate increases reducing
the bargaining power of input sellers, restricting their ability to raise the input
price. And also cutting the demand for output produced, reducing the scope for
output price increases.

14

Immediate surplus decline acceptance

Immediate acceptance means no inflation caused by targeting too high real
surpluses as the target surplus of both parties immediately adjusts
15

Sluggish (20%) surplus decline acceptance

Sluggish acceptance leads to temporary inflation as targeted surpluses adjust to
real surpluses. The positive terms of trade shock at time 26 has a negative
effect on inflation provided real income increases are also sluggishly accepted.
16

Acceptance of the surplus declines never happens
Acceptance rate = 0

Refusal to accept decline in surplus means inflation increases persistently.
The positive terms of trade shock at time 26 decreases inflation, but it is
still positively increased compared to time 0.

Acceptance of the surplus decline is facilitated by monetary
policy action

Monetary policy can facilitate a similar path to a sluggish acceptance of surplus decline.
Compared to the refusal to accept, the dotted paths show that the increase in inflation will
only be temporary elevated as the targeted surpluses are facilitated down.
20

Existing literature on the refusal to accept a real surplus decline
• The framework in Layard Nickell Jackman has real wage resistance which
encapsulates this concept for workers.
➢

In response to a real income shock the NAIRU rises.

➢

To get workers to accept the decline in income the bargaining power of the worker is being
reduced by higher unemployment leading to eventual acceptance in the reduction of their surplus.

➢

Once sellers accept their decline in surplus, firms are no longer pushed to increase their prices
and are encouraged to accept a surplus decline as average buyer bargaining power falls.

• Other resolution: Reversal of the ToT shock, increasing productivity, increasing
labour supply.
• Refusal to accept a surplus decline may be further micro founded by real adjustment
costs to income declines or minimum income requirements for input sellers and
buyers to continue production.
