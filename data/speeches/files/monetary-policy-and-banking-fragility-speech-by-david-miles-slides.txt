(a) I use GDP and trend growth estimates from Hills, Thomas and Dimsdale ( Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2010) to
create this chart. The authors use a Hodrick-Prescott filter to separate the trend and the cyclical components of real GDP
growth. I assume that their trend growth estimate at the start of each recession would have prevailed during the following
seven years had the recession not occurred
occurred. The chart shows deviations of actual GDP from this projected trend growth
growth.
The dotted line for the latest recession uses the MPC’s mean projection for output growth over the forecast horizon as
reported in the May 2011 Inflation report.
