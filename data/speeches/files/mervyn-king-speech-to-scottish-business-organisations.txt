Two years ago Scotland was home to two of the largest and most respected international
banks. Both are now largely state-owned. Sir Walter Scott would have been mortified
by these events. Writing in 1826, under the pseudonym of Malachi Malagrowther, he
observed that:

“Not only did the Banks dispersed throughout Scotland afford the means of
bringing the country to an unexpected and almost marvellous degree of
prosperity, but in no considerable instance, save one [the Ayr Bank], have their
own over-speculating undertakings been the means of interrupting that
prosperity”.

Banking has not been good for the wealth of the Scottish – and, it should be said, almost
any other – nation recently. Over the past year, almost six million jobs have been lost in
the United States, over 2 ½ million in the euro area, and over half a million in the United
Kingdom. Our national debt is rising rapidly, not least as the consequence of support to
the banking system. We shall all be paying for the impact of this crisis on the public
finances for a generation.

The United Kingdom faces two fundamental long-run challenges. First, to rebalance the
economy, with more resources allocated to business investment and net exports and
fewer to consumption. That is consistent with the need – now widely accepted – to
eliminate the large structural fiscal deficit and to raise the national saving rate. It is part
of a need for a wider rebalancing of domestic demand in the world economy away from
those countries that borrowed and ran current account deficits towards those that lent and
ran surpluses.

Second, both the structure and regulation of banking in the UK need reform. Banks
increased both the size and leverage of their balance sheets to levels that threatened
stability of the system as a whole. They remain extraordinarily dependent on the public
sector for support. That was necessary in the immediate crisis, but is not sustainable in
the medium term.

3
These two challenges are interrelated. In creating the crisis, imbalances in the world
economy led to unusually low real interest rates and large net capital flows from the
emerging market economies to the developed world. That provided the fuel which an
inadequately designed regulatory system ignited to produce the financial firestorm that
engulfed us all. If our response to the crisis focuses only on the symptoms rather than the
underlying causes of the crisis, then we shall bequeath to future generations a serious risk
of another crisis even worse than the one we have experienced.

Tonight I want to focus on the second of those challenges – reform of the structure and
regulation of the banking system. Why were banks willing to take risks that proved so
damaging both to themselves and the rest of the economy? One of the key reasons –
mentioned by market participants in conversations before the crisis hit – is that the
incentives to manage risk and to increase leverage were distorted by the implicit support
or guarantee provided by government to creditors of banks that were seen as “too
important to fail”. Such banks could raise funding more cheaply and expand faster than
other institutions. They had less incentive than others to guard against tail risk. Banks
and their creditors knew that if they were sufficiently important to the economy or the
rest of the financial system, and things went wrong, the government would always stand
behind them. And they were right.

The sheer scale of support to the banking sector is breathtaking. In the UK, in the form
of direct or guaranteed loans and equity investment, it is not far short of a trillion (that is,
one thousand billion) pounds, close to two-thirds of the annual output of the entire
economy. To paraphrase a great wartime leader, never in the field of financial endeavour
has so much money been owed by so few to so many. And, one might add, so far with
little real reform.

It is hard to see how the existence of institutions that are “too important to fail” is
consistent with their being in the private sector. Encouraging banks to take risks that
result in large dividend and remuneration payouts when things go well, and losses for
taxpayers when they don’t, distorts the allocation of resources and management of risk.

4
That is what economists mean by “moral hazard”. The massive support extended to the
banking sector around the world, while necessary to avert economic disaster, has created
possibly the biggest moral hazard in history. The “too important to fail” problem is too
important to ignore.

There are only two ways in which the problem can - in logic - be solved. One is to accept
that some institutions are “too important to fail” and try to ensure that the probability of
those institutions failing, and hence of the need for taxpayer support, is extremely low.
The other is to find a way that institutions can fail without imposing unacceptable costs
on the rest of society. Any solution must fall into one of those two categories. What
does this mean in practice?

Consider the first approach. To reduce the likelihood of failure, regulators can impose
capital requirements on a wide range of financial institutions related to the risks they are
taking. This is the current approach underpinned by the Basel regime. In essence, it
makes banks build a buffer against adverse events. It has attractions but also problems.
First, capital requirements reduce, but not eliminate, the need for taxpayers to provide
catastrophe insurance. Second, the “riskiness” of a bank’s activities and the liquidity of
its funding can change suddenly and radically as market expectations shift. This means
that what appeared to be an adequate capital or liquidity cushion one day appears wholly
inadequate the next.

Indeed, the Achilles heel of the Basel regime is the assumption that there is a constant
capital ratio which delivers the desired degree of stability of the banking system. After
the experience of the past two years, and a decade or more in which capital ratios fell and
leverage ratios rose to historically unprecedented levels, banks need more capital to
persuade investors to fund them. A larger buffer gives new creditors greater comfort that
their claims will be met in future, without resort to the public purse. And rather than pay
out dividends or generous remuneration, banks should use earnings to build larger capital
buffers. But how much larger? We simply don’t know. A higher ratio is safer than a
lower one, but any fixed ratio is bound to be arbitrary.

5
One way of dealing with this problem is to require banks to take out insurance in the
form of “contingent capital”, that is capital in a form that automatically converts to
common equity upon the trigger of a threshold that kicks in before a bank becomes
insolvent. If a bank’s regulatory core tier 1 capital – common equity – remained above
the threshold, nothing would happen. But if the regulatory core tier 1 capital fell below
the threshold then the contingent capital would automatically be converted to common
equity. When bank failures impose costs on the rest of the economy, it is reasonable to
insist that banks themselves purchase a sufficient degree of insurance in the form of a
large capital cushion available automatically before insolvency.

Such contingent capital instruments are very different from instruments, such as
subordinated debt, which banks have been permitted to count as capital under the Basel
regime, but which do not provide a reliable capital buffer until too late – after the bank
has failed. So at present the taxpayer is providing capital that is exposed to future losses
rather than investors in debt-like capital instruments of a troubled bank. Whether
investors would be willing to provide contingent capital on the required scale would
depend upon the price, but at least the cost would fall where it belongs – on the banks.

So the first approach to the “too important to fail” problem might be made to work with a
requirement for contingent capital. It is worth a try. But it has three drawbacks. First,
banks still have an incentive to take really big risks because the government would
provide some back-stop catastrophe insurance. Second, experience has shown that it is
difficult to assess risks of infrequent but high-impact events, and so it is dangerous to
allow activities characterised by such risks to contaminate the essential – or utility –
services that the banking sector provides to the wider economy. Both of these drawbacks
mean that it is almost impossible to calculate how much contingent capital would be
appropriate. And a third drawback is that the approach probably requires the extension of
detailed regulation, and especially a special resolution regime, to all institutions deemed
“too important to fail” – or could become “too important to fail” in the middle of a crisis
– in order to prevent a bank failure leading to conventional insolvency procedures. It

6
remains to be seen whether that scope would be easy to define beforehand. Failure to
deal with the underlying problem draws regulators deeper into murky waters.

The second approach rejects the idea that some institutions should be allowed to become
“too important to fail”. Instead of asking who should perform what regulation, it asks
why we regulate banks. It draws a clear distinction between different activities that
banks undertake. The banking system provides two crucial services to the rest of the
economy: providing companies and households a ready means by which they can make
payments for goods and services and intermediating flows of savings to finance
investment. Those are the utility aspects of banking where we all have a common interest
in ensuring continuity of service. And for this reason they are quite different in nature
from some of the riskier financial activities that banks undertake, such as proprietary
trading.

In other industries we separate those functions that are utility in nature – and are
regulated – from those that can safely be left to the discipline of the market. The second
approach adapts those insights to the regulation of banking. At one end of the spectrum
is the proposal for “narrow banks”, recently revived by John Kay, which would separate
totally the provision of payments services from the creation of risky assets. In that way
deposits are guaranteed. At the other is the proposal in the G30 report by Paul Volcker,
former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, to separate proprietary trading from retail
banking. The common element is the aim of restricting government guarantees to utility
banking.

There are those who claim that such proposals are impractical. It is hard to see why.
Existing prudential regulation makes distinctions between different types of banking
activities when determining capital requirements. What does seem impractical, however,
are the current arrangements. Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to
retail depositors and other creditors, and then suggested that such funding could be used
to finance highly risky and speculative activities, would be thought rather unworldly. But
that is where we now are.

7
It is important that banks in receipt of public support are not encouraged to try to earn
their way out of that support by resuming the very activities that got them into trouble in
the first place. The sheer creative imagination of the financial sector to think up new
ways of taking risk will in the end, I believe, force us to confront the “too important to
fail” question. The belief that appropriate regulation can ensure that speculative activities
do not result in failures is a delusion.

Separation of activities does not resolve all misaligned incentives. Where private sector
entities outside of the utility banking sector engage in a high degree of maturity
transformation on a scale that could have consequences for the rest of the economy, the
government would not want to stand aside when such an entity fails. That is the heart of
the matter. Maturity transformation reduces the cost of finance to a wide range of risky
activities, at least some of which are beneficial, but the implicit government guarantee
means that the true cost of that maturity mismatch does not, as it should, fall on those
who receive the benefits. The aim of policy should be to minimise or eliminate that
subsidy. Separation of activities helps not hinders that objective, not least because it is
the mixture of activities that reduces the robustness of the system. Although there are no
simple answers, it is in our collective interest to reduce the dependence of so many
households and businesses on so few institutions that engage in so many risky activities.
The case for a serious review of how the banking industry is structured and regulated is
strong.

By international standards UK banking is highly concentrated. There are four large UK
banking groups. Of these four, two are largely in state ownership and their assets are a
multiple of the assets of the next largest bank. As in the English Premier League, getting
into the top four will not be easy for those outside it. But in both cases I hope greater
competition will produce less rigidity in the composition of the top four.

Whichever approach to the “too important to fail” problem is adopted, there is growing
agreement that such financial institutions should, as I argued at the Mansion House in
June, be made to plan for their own orderly wind down – to write their own will. I

8
welcome that, but without separation of the utility from other components of banking it
will be necessary to develop detailed resolution procedures for a very wide class of
financial institutions. The options may turn out to be separation of activities, on the one
hand, or ever increasingly detailed regulatory oversight, with the costs that that entails
for innovation in, and the efficiency of, the financial system, on the other.

So far, I have discussed measures to ensure that the financial system can continue to
function when individual institutions find themselves in difficulty. But there are broader
policy goals relevant to financial stability. The crisis certainly suggests that there is a
need for additional policy tools that can (a) moderate the growth of the financial sector
and (b) lean against the macroeconomic effects of the credit cycle. The Bank is working
with others to explore such macro-prudential instruments, and we will be setting out our
thinking in a discussion paper and a speech by Paul Tucker later in the week. Given the
difficulty of applying such tools to overseas banks, their use in (a) is likely to be more
productive than in (b). The key point though is that parallel to the long-established role
which monetary policy plays in taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going,
so there is a role for the central bank to use macro-prudential policy instruments for
financial stability purposes by turning down the music just as the dancing gets a little too
wild.

As we focus on how to create a sound and stable financial system, we cannot neglect the
rest of the economy. Recent months have brought better news here. Around the world,
the sharp falls in output that occurred over the winter have largely come to an end, and
business and consumer confidence have improved somewhat. It is likely that in the
second half of this year, the UK economy will return to positive, if modest, growth.
Financial markets have improved, with banks finding it easier and less costly to access
wholesale funding markets, and in time this should ease lending conditions to households
and businesses.

These developments are encouraging. But they need to be seen in context, and we should
be under no illusion that the path to a sustained recovery will be smooth and painless.

9
Output is still well below and unemployment well above their levels of a year ago, and
are likely to remain so for sometime. To keep inflation close to the 2% target, monetary
policy tries to keep a balance between overall demand and supply. Judging that balance,
given an impaired banking sector and the likelihood of a significant fiscal tightening over
the next few years, is particularly difficult.

At the moment, inflation is 1.1%. Many have forgotten that only a year ago it reached
5.2%. It is likely that inflation will remain volatile over the coming year. It will pick up
over the next few months reflecting higher petrol prices, recent falls in sterling and the
reversal of the cut in VAT. Looking through these short-run factors, however, inflation
will be determined by the path of money spending relative to the supply capacity of the
economy. Over the past year money spending, which normally expands at around 5% a
year, has fallen by 5%. That is already pulling down on inflation and will continue to do
so until spending recovers. To put money spending back on a desirable trajectory is
likely to require a pick up in the growth rate of broad money in the economy. That is
precisely what our asset purchase programme, by injecting more money directly into the
economy, aims to achieve.

In deciding when and by how much our present programme of asset purchases should be
either expanded or reduced, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to base its
decision each month on a judgement of the action required to meet the 2% target for
inflation.

Before the financial crisis, a generation of households and businesses had accepted that
the discipline of a market economy was the most promising route to prosperity.
Uncomfortable though it seemed, the importance of more flexible labour markets,
greater competition in product markets, regulation of privatised utilities and allowing
unsuccessful businesses to fail, came to be widely understood. Then, out of what must
have appeared to many of you to be a clear blue sky of economic stability, arose a
financial firestorm that wreaked substantial damage to the real economy, and we have

10
not yet seen its full consequences. The case for market discipline is no less compelling
for banking than for other industries.

So I am sure that we can turn this crisis to our long-run advantage by reviewing and
reforming the structure and regulation of banking. As Sir Walter Scott noted, the failure
of the Ayr Bank in 1772 “was a terrible [warning], and has been so well attended to in
Scotland … forcing a capital on the district could only lead to wild speculation, instead
of supporting solid and promising undertakings”. Of the bankers themselves, Scott
recognised that, while the majority were “good men”, “there may have been, among so
numerous a body, men of a different character, fishers in troubled waters, capitalists who
sought gain not by the encouragement of fair trade and honest industry, but by affording
temporary fuel to rashness or avarice”.

If unsustainable capital flows provided the fuel and an inadequately designed regulatory
system ignited the fuel, the past two years have shown how dangerous it is to let bankers
play with fire. This is not a question of blame – as Sir Walter rightly said, the majority in
the industry are “good men” and women. It is a matter of the incentives they face. To
protect our genuinely successful financial centres – of which Edinburgh is clearly one –
reform of banking is essential. With that, I am confident that we will have attended to
our terrible warning and our varied and internationally competitive financial services
industry will thrive.
