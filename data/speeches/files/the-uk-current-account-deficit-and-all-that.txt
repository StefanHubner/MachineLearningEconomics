Summary
1.

The UK current account in 2005 was, at £31.9b., around 2 ½% of GDP, half a
percentage point above the average deficit of the last twenty years. This means
that foreign residents have added £31.9b. more to their pile of UK assets than
UK residents added to their pile of foreign assets.

2.

These piles of assets are huge, at around four times UK GDP, and the sums
added to them each year are also enormous, at around 60% of UK GDP.
Furthermore, the piles change in value not only because of additions each year
from the current financial account but, more importantly, because of
revaluations.

3.

A significant feature of these piles of assets is that the pile held by UK residents
is weighted much more towards equity type investments (direct investment and
equity securities) than UK assets held by foreign residents. Typically, equity
type assets have higher average returns than debt type assets.

4.

This has led to two outcomes favourable to the UK. First, the income generated
by the foreign assets owned by UK residents exceeds that generated by UK
assets owned by foreign residents by over 2% of GDP in recent years. Second,
despite the continuing current account deficit of around 2% of GDP for the last
twenty years, the difference between UK assets and UK liabilities remains only
modestly negative compared to the size of each of the stocks. Furthermore, if
the stocks are adjusted to market value, UK assets continue to exceed UK
liabilities. In particular, the UK has a strong positive net balance on stocks of
foreign direct investment to the tune of over £500b. once adjusted to market
value. Thus despite some recent well-publicised purchases of UK companies
by foreign concerns, UK companies own far more foreign assets than foreign
companies own UK assets.

5.

So long as average returns on equity type assets continue to exceed average
returns on debt type assets, the current position is probably sustainable. Risks
include first, a continuing and rapid increase in the trade deficit which might
eventually undermine the favourable adjusted net asset position. This would
probably take a long time. Second, a significant fall in the long-term returns on
equity relative to returns on debt. Third, UK assets held by foreign residents
become more weighted towards equity type investments, perhaps by a massive
purchase of UK companies by foreign concerns. Finally, a large and permanent
real appreciation of sterling which would significantly reduce UK assets
relative to UK liabilities. As present, this seems unlikely.

1. Introduction
When talking to a variety of audiences about the state of the UK economy, it is
almost inevitable that one of the older participants brings up the question of the
balance of payments. In particular they recall that back in the 1960s, the
balance of payments used to be accorded front page headlines. By contrast,
today, it is barely mentioned at the back of the business section. However, a
related issue, the purchase of UK firms by foreign companies is currently
making waves. As Hamish McRae remarks, “Are we selling the farm to cover
the dissolute son’s losses on the gambling tables of London?” (Independent, 15
Feb. 2006).
In what follows, I shall try and address some of these issues. I first consider the
structure of the current account and place it into a historical perspective. I then
focus on the stock position, analysing the composition of UK assets and
liabilities and how this tends to generate a favourable net income position for
the UK. Finally, I analyse the sustainability of the present situation1.
2. The Balance of Payments in 2005
The balance of payments is concerned with the flows of goods, services and
payments into and out of the country. To see how it all works, it is best to get
down to detail. Start with the current account, defined as follows:
current account balance = trade balance in goods + trade
balance in services + net income flows + current transfers
Next, we must see what each of these categories means.
Trade balance in goods (services) =
value of goods (services) exports – value of goods (services) imports.

4

Net income flow = flow of income (eg. interest payments,
dividends etc.) generated by foreign assets held by
domestic residents – flow of income generated by
domestic assets held by foreign residents.
Current transfers = taxes, social contributions received from
non-residents + net social security payments +
net transfers with international origins – foreign aid
payments + other items.
In Table 1, we set out the picture for 2005.

A number of points arise from this breakdown which is fairly typical of recent
years. First, goods imports exceed goods exports by a significant amount
(£65.6b.). In fact, goods imports have exceeded goods exports in every year bar
five since 1946. But, as a proportion of GDP, this deficit on goods trade has
generally been greater in the last two decades than previously, despite the UK
being a net exporter of oil over most of this period. Furthermore, it continues to
rise. Second, services exports, which are now around 50% of goods exports,
substantially exceed services imports to the tune of £18.7b. Again, this is

5

typical in the sense that services exports have exceeded services imports in
every year bar two since 1951. As a percentage of GDP, this surplus has been
relatively stable for thirty years.
The income flows in 2005 reveal that UK residents received a flow of income
generated by foreign assets considerably in excess of the income flow generated
by UK assets held by foreign residents (£27.4b.). This “net income position”
tends to be a little more variable than the trade surpluses and deficits, although
in recent years it has generally been positive. However, it was negative as
recently as 1999 and was significantly negative in the early 1990s (over ½% of
GDP in 1990-91). Finally, the balance of current transfers is significantly
negative (-£12.4b) and this is typical of recent decades when aid payments and
net EC contributions have been important features. As a proportion of GDP,
this element of the current account has been relatively stable over the last thirty
years.
All these elements add up to a current account deficit of £31.9b., around
2½ % of GDP. This is somewhat above the average current account deficit
over the last twenty years (1985-2004), and a great deal above the average
deficit in the previous thirty (1955-1984), which was close to zero.
So what does it mean to have a current account deficit of £31.9b? Essentially
foreign residents have added a flow of income to their total holdings of UK
assets which exceeds the total flow of income which UK residents have added
to their total holdings of foreign assets by £31.9b. So foreigners have, in 2005,
added £31.9b. more to their pile of UK assets than UK residents have added to
their pile of foreign assets. In fact, both foreign residents and UK residents
have added huge amounts to their respective piles, in excess of £700b., but the
foreign residents have added somewhat more. To look at this in more detail, we

6

present, in Table 2, a picture of the capital and financial account for 2005. In
order to understand this, note first that the capital account consists of numerous
odds and ends including land purchases and sales associated with embassies,
the transfers of migrants, and EU regional development fund payments. It is
very small relative to the other elements. In the financial account, direct
investment refers to the purchase by the residents of one country of a significant
part (exceeding 10%) of an enterprise in another country. So the credit column
refers to money spent by foreign residents

on direct investment in UK enterprises and the debit column to money spent by
UK residents on direct investment in foreign enterprises. So when Banco
Santander purchased Abbey, this represented a large sum in the direct
investment credit column in 2004 and when Vodafone purchased Mannesmann,
this represented an even larger sum in the direct investment debit column in
2000.
Portfolio investment refers to the purchase by residents of one country of equity
and debt securities issued in another country. So in the credit column appear
the net purchases by foreign residents of UK equities and debt securities. In the

7

debit column we see the net purchases of foreign equity and debt securities by
UK residents. Finally, other investment refers to bank deposits made by
residents of one country in banks in another country or to loans made by
residents in one country to residents in another. So in the credit column we find
net increases in deposits made by foreign residents in UK banks or net increases
in loans made by foreign residents to UK residents. In the debit column, we
simply find the reverse.
Turning to Table 2, the first striking point is that the totals under both debit and
credit columns are enormous, around 60% of UK GDP. This is a function of
the fact that the UK financial sector is highly integrated with the world
economy and plays an important intermediary role in a high proportion of the
World’s financial transactions. Thus for example, if a UK bank receives £10b.
in deposits from foreign residents and then lends this £10b. to other foreign
residents, the first transaction contributes £10b. to the credit column and the
second transaction contributes £10b. to the debit column, both in the other
investment category. Or, for example, if the bank takes the £10b. of deposits
from foreign residents, lends this to a UK firm which then uses it to buy a
foreign company for £10b., then this money will appear in the credit column
under other investment and in the debit column under direct investment.
Because these types of transactions are so commonplace, we see huge totals in
both credit and debit columns which tend to differ by proportionately very
small amounts. Second, given the relative sizes of the different types of
transaction in each column, it is no surprise that the total stocks of foreign
assets held by domestic residents consist mostly of “other investments”, with
portfolio investments and direct investments coming second and third in the
rankings.

8

Finally, we may note the errors and omissions entry with a balance of £4.8b.
As the name indicates, this is the result of transactions or elements of
transactions that are not picked up by the ONS.
Having seen how the various cross-border transactions add up in 2005, it is
worth putting the current account numbers into some historical perspective.
3. The Current Account: Some History
In Table 3, we show the different elements of the UK current account as
percentages of GDP in 5-year averages back to 1955 as well as annual data for
the last decade. A number of features of these data are worth remarking on.
Starting with goods trade, we see how there is typically a deficit with the
exception of the recession period of 1980-84. During this period imports were
particularly low and the UK became a serious net exporter of oil following the
development of the North Sea oil fields. Aside from this exceptional period,
from the 1970s the deficit on goods trade has been substantial, rising

to over 4% of GDP in the last five-year period and over 5% in 2005. By
contrast, from the 1970s, trade in services has generated a steady surplus
averaging around 1.4% of GDP. The big jump in the absolute sizes of the trade
deficits (goods) and surpluses (services) after the 1960s was probably
associated with membership of the European Community in the early 1970s
which induced a significant opening of the UK economy to trade of all kinds.
This allowed the apparent comparative advantage of the UK in the production
of services relative to goods to come to the fore.

10

The changes in net income flows are a little more erratic, the most notable
feature being the dramatic increase in these flows in the 21st century. Why this
happened we shall discuss in subsequent sections. It is clear, however, that
without this increase, the current account deficit in the 21st century would have
been exceptionally high. Current transfers, by contrast, have been relatively
stable since the mid-1970s.
Turning to the current account as a whole, the key fact is that prior to 1985, the
current account switched back and forth between surplus and deficit and
averaged close to zero. Since 1985, the UK has seen a consistent deficit
averaging around 2% of GDP. In 2005 it rose to 2½% of GDP. The important
point here is whether or not such a continuing current account deficit is
sustainable. It has been going on for twenty years but does it mean we in the
UK are “living beyond our means” and that it will end in tears?
As we have seen in the previous section, a current account deficit of 2% of
GDP means that over the course of the year, foreign residents added to their
holdings of UK assets by more than UK residents added to their holdings of
foreign assets, the difference being 2% of UK GDP. Over twenty years, foreign
residents added to their holdings of UK assets to the tune of 40% of UK GDP
more than UK residents added to their holdings of foreign assets. So the
holdings of UK assets by foreigners must apparently be growing steadily
relative to the holdings of foreign assets by UK residents. We would then
expect the total income (interest, dividends etc.) generated by the pile of UK
assets owned by foreigners to be growing faster than the income generated by
the pile of foreign assets owned by UK residents. The latter minus the former is
the net income flow which should therefore be falling steadily. But a glance at
the third column of Table 3 shows that far from falling, this net income flow
has risen dramatically in recent years. Furthermore, according to the official

11

statistics, despite foreign residents adding 2% of GDP per year more to their
pile of UK assets than UK residents have to their pile of foreign assets in the
last twenty years, the UK assets of foreign residents have risen relative to the
foreign assets of UK residents by only about 20% of UK GDP over this period.
So what is going on here? Two things. First, the size of the piles of assets is
influenced not only by the flows of assets which are added to them but also by
the changes in the market value of the existing assets as real asset prices
change2. Second, returns per Pound of assets differ widely across different
assets, so the income flow generated by different piles of assets can differ
significantly even if the piles are of the same size. What this all means is that in
order to investigate questions of sustainability, we must look more closely at the
asset position of the UK economy rather than simply focussing on income
flows. This is known by the ONS as the International Investment Position, but I
shall simply call it the net asset position.
4. The UK Net Asset Position
In Figure 1, we present the values of the gross foreign assets of UK residents
and their gross foreign liabilities, which are, of course, the UK assets owned by
foreign residents. First, we see that both foreign assets and foreign liabilities
have grown dramatically in the last fifteen years, much more rapidly than
nominal GDP. By 2005, they had reached nearly £5,000b., around four times
UK GDP. Relative to GDP, the size of these stocks of foreign assets and
liabilities is far higher in the UK than in any other country.
A second point to note is how small the net asset position (assets less liabilities)
is relative to the size of the stocks. Since 1995, this net asset position has been
negative, averaging around 8% of GDP. It jumps around a fair bit, generally
because of movements in the exchange rate. For example, if all assets are in

12

foreign currency and all liabilities are in sterling3, since both are around 400%
of GDP, a 2 per cent appreciation of sterling would worsen the net asset
position by 8% of GDP. So it is not surprising that revaluations of assets and
liabilities have a much bigger impact on year-to-year fluctuations in the UK net
asset position than the differential additions to assets and liabilities emerging
from the current account. Nevertheless, it is true that the UK net asset position
was positive to the tune of 13.6% of GDP in 1980-84, but after twenty years of
current account deficits averaging 2% of GDP, the UK net asset position
averaged -8.6% of GDP in 2000-05.
So, in the light of this, why has the UK net income position improved so
dramatically in recent years? A clue to this puzzle is provided by dividing the
UK net asset position into its asset components, which are set out in Figure 2.
What stands out is the surge in the positive UK net asset position in Direct
Investment and the almost equivalent move in the opposite direction of Other
Investment. Since, in these data, Direct Investment is measured at book value,
generally lower than market value, this shows clearly how UK residents have
been purchasing foreign enterprises at a faster rate than foreign residents have
been buying UK enterprises, particularly since the late 1990s. This picture is
shown more clearly in Figure 3, where we see that in every year in the last
decade except for 2005, outward direct investment by UK residents has
exceeded inward direct investment. Indeed, the purchase of Mannesmann by
Vodaphone and of Atlantic Richfield by BP Amoco in 2000 represented more
outward investment by UK companies than the entire total of inward direct
investment by foreign companies in the three years 2001-3. However, it is true
that for the first time in many years, inward direct investment in the UK has
significantly exceeded outward direct investment in the last year (2005) and this
has provoked a heavy volume of comment.

13

Looking again at Figure 2, we see that since the late 1990s, the UK has had a
strongly positive net asset position in direct investment with negative positions
in all other assets. Has this anything to do with the dramatic improvement in
the net income position over the same period? The answer to this question
appears to be yes. If we look at the income generated by each group of assets
and liabilities and normalise on the stock of assets, we can generate implied
(nominal) rates of return. These we show in Figure 4. What stands out is, first,
that nominal rates of return are generally falling as inflation and nominal
interest rates fall. Second, we see that rates of return on direct investment are
generally higher than the other rates of return. One obvious reason for this is
that direct investment is measured at book value which is typically below
market value. A second possibility is that direct investment is more risky than
other investments and the higher average returns are, in part, compensating for
this.
Since stocks of direct investment are not measured at market value, is it
possible to make some corrections to these data to get closer to the desired
market value measures? Pratten (1996) has undertaken the most extensive
investigation of this issue. In 1991, Pratten collected data on 167 companies
which accounted for 77% of non-bank outward direct investment and a further
173 overseas companies accounting for 51% of non-bank inward direct
investment. Analysis of these data led Pratten to conclude that market : book
value ratios were 2.05 for outward investment and 1.25 for inward investment.
However, in order to accommodate potential biases, Pratten suggests that more
cautious estimates of market : book ratios should be used, namely 1.75 for
outward investment and 1.50 for inward investment. Extending forward
Pratten’s analysis by using changes in stock market indices as a proxy for
changes in market value and adjusting outward direct investment for exchange
rate movements, we find, using Pratten’s cautious estimates, that rates of return

14

on the estimated market values of direct investment are much closer to the rates
of return on the other assets (see Elliott and Wong Min, 2004, and Burnett and
Manning, 2003, for further details). In figure 5, we show the original and
adjusted rates of return on direct investment and the comparison rate of return
on all other assets (equities, debt securities, other investments). Then, in Figure
6, we show the “Pratten adjusted” net asset position, both in total and divided
into direct investment and all other assets.
Looking first at the net asset position, we see that once we make the market :
book adjustment to direct investment, the overall net asset position remains
positive and is much the same today as it was in 1990. Since the late 1990s, the
UK has developed a strong positive position in direct investment offset by a
large negative position in the remaining assets, most of which are in the other
investments category. Looking back at Figure 5, we see that while the implied
return on all assets excluding direct investment has declined since the late
1990s, the implied return on direct investment has risen since the same date.
This combination of the development of a significant positive position on direct
investment and a sharp rise in the return on direct investment relative to other
assets is the key factor underlying the dramatic improvement in the UK net
income position in the 21st century.
5. Is the Present Position Sustainable?
First, let us summarise the present situation. The annual current account deficit
is now around 2½ % of GDP, somewhat above the average deficit over the last
twenty years. The overall trade deficit has averaged around 2.8% of GDP in
recent years but is currently (2005) around 3.9% of GDP. This large deficit has
been reinforced by a deficit on current transfers of around 1% of GDP.
However, since 2000, the average annual net income flow has been close to 2%
of GDP, providing a significant offset to the trade deficit. Indeed, currently

15

(2005), the net income flow is running at 2.3% of GDP. So the basic position is
that the UK now has a very large trade deficit, a significant portion of which is
offset by a substantial positive net income position.
The sustainability of this situation depends on three factors. First, is the trade
deficit likely to continue to worsen? Second, is the net asset position likely to
remain close to zero, despite a continuing current account deficit? Third, will
this small positive or negative net asset position continue to be associated with a
substantial positive net income position? Concerning the first question, it is
plain from Table 3 that since the appreciation of Sterling in 1996/7, the trade
deficit has risen steadily. Given that domestic demand growth, and hence
import growth, was weak in 2005, we might expect a further worsening of the
trade deficit in the short run as domestic demand growth recovers. But a
continued worsening of the trade deficit in the long run is more uncertain.
Furthermore, even if it does worsen, this is not necessarily a threat to
sustainability. The key issue in this context is the asset position. This takes us
to the second question which relates to the overall net asset position. This is
now a small difference between two enormous stocks. As a consequence,
changes in the net asset position tend to be dominated by revaluations of the
stocks as exchange rates and stock markets move up and down. These changes
have tended to offset the impact of the cumulated current account deficits since
1990 (see Figure 6). Can this be expected to continue? Looking at Figure 2 or
Figure 6 it is plain that since 1990, the net portfolio of the UK is strongly
positive in equity type investments (direct investment, equity investment) and
strongly negative in debt type investments (debt securities, other investments)4.
Historically, average capital gains on the former exceed those on the latter
although they are more variable. If this continues and the balance of the net
portfolio remains weighted in favour of equity type assets, we can expect that
on average over long periods, revaluations of stocks of assets and liabilities will

16

probably continue to offset a current account deficit at its present level, unless
there is a significant and permanent real appreciation of Sterling. This latter
seems unlikely at the present juncture.
Turning to the third question, can we expect the substantial positive net income
position to continue? This situation also depends crucially on the fact that
while the overall net asset position is close to zero, the net external position in
direct investment is strongly positive. On top of this, the total returns on this
class of asset have been higher than any other class. Indeed recently, with very
low long-term interest rates on fixed interest securities, this gap has got bigger.
There are two overall threats to this state of affairs. First, the return generated
by equity type assets may fall significantly relative to that generated by debt
type assets. This is certainly possible. As the work of Mehra and Prescott
(1985) makes clear, the average difference between equity and debt returns
within each decade has varied wildly from one decade to another throughout the
20th century, although it does tend to remain positive. A second threat is the
possibility that the net external position in direct investment will reverse. Given
the speed with which much of the existing positive position developed (ie. over
ten years) and given the small reversal of this position in 2005, it is conceivable
that this situation could completely reverse. However, the adjusted positive
position in direct investment is now of the order of £500b. To turn this into a
negative direct investment position of £200b, say, would, at current prices,
require foreign residents to purchase all the top UK companies in every market
sector except Banking, Oil and Mining. This would include BAE, Rolls-Royce,
Diageo, BT, Tesco, Unilever, National Grid, Marks and Spencer, Reckitt, BAA,
Aviva, B Sky B, Vodafone, Glaxo Smith Kline, Astra Zeneca, BAT as well as
over 35 other major companies. Despite the current attraction of UK companies
to foreign residents, the notion that UK residents would cease foreign direct

17

investment while foreign residents bought even a significant proportion of the
above-mentioned companies seems somewhat improbable.
We may summarise this discussion of sustainability as follows. We have now
reached a position where the stocks of UK assets and liabilities are enormous, at
four times GDP, and relative to these stocks, the gap between them is tiny.
Furthermore, the asset side is overweight in equity type investment and
underweight in debt type investment relative to the liabilities side. If the
historical pattern of returns on these two different types of investments
continues, then it is probable that the overall net asset position will not worsen
dramatically even if the current account deficit remains at existing levels.
Furthermore, it is also probable that the net income position will continue to be
significantly positive. Risks to this favourable prognosis are first, the trade
deficit will continue to worsen by enough to drag down the current account
despite a favourable net income flow. This may eventually undermine the
favourable adjusted net asset position although this would probably take a
considerable time. Second, the returns on equity type investments worsen
significantly relative to the returns on debt type investments. Third, the flows
of foreign direct investments into the UK significantly exceed UK direct
investments abroad for a long period. Fourth, there is a significant real
appreciation of Sterling which may generate revaluations of the stocks leading
to a large fall in UK assets relative to liabilities.
Conclusions
The UK current account deficit in 2005 was, at £31.9b., around 2½ % of GDP,
half a percentage point above the average deficit of the last twenty years. This
means that foreign residents have added £31.9b. more to their pile of UK assets
than UK residents added to their pile of foreign assets. These piles of assets are
now huge (around four times UK GDP) and the sums added to them each year

18

are also enormous (around 60% of UK GDP). Furthermore, relative to the
height of the piles, the difference in their size is tiny.
A significant feature of these piles of assets is that the pile of foreign assets held
by UK residents is weighted much more towards equity type assets (direct
investment and equity securities) than the UK assets held by foreign residents.
Historically, equity type assets have had higher average returns than debt type
assets. This has led to two outcomes favourable to the UK. First, the income
generated by the foreign assets owned by UK residents exceeds that generated
by UK assets owned by foreign residents by over 2% of GDP in recent years.
Second, despite the continuing current account deficit of around 2% of GDP for
the last twenty years, the difference between UK assets and UK liabilities
remains only modestly negative compared to the size of each of the stocks.
Furthermore, if the stocks are adjusted to market value, UK assets continue to
exceed UK liabilities.
So long as average returns on equity type assets continue to exceed average
returns on debt type assets, the current position is probably sustainable. Risks
include first, a continuing and rapid increase in the trade deficit which might
eventually undermine the favourable adjusted net asset position. This would
probably take a long time. Second, a significant fall in the long-term returns on
equity relative to returns on debt. Third, UK assets held by foreign residents
become more weighted towards equity type investments, perhaps by a massive
purchase of UK companies by foreign concerns. Finally, a large and permanent
real appreciation of sterling which would significantly reduce UK assets
relative to UK liabilities. At present, this seems unlikely.

Footnotes
1. Much of this is not new. Reading and Richards (2005) have recently
brought some of this material to the attention of a wider public.
2. In fact the errors and omissions in the balance of payments are counted
by the ONS as part of the revaluation of the net asset position rather than
as part of the income flows into each pile of assets.
3. In practice this is not the case. UK residents may hold some foreign
assets denominated in Sterling and foreign residents may hold some UK
assets denominated in foreign currency.
4. Not dissimilar to a large bank.
