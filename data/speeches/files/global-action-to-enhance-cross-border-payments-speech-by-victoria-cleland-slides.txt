The cross-border payments market is significant, and growing in
importance in an ever more interconnected global economy

The value of cross-border payments is
forecast to increase from almost $150tr in
2017 to over $250tr by 2027 [1]

Global corporates move nearly $23.5tr across countries
annually, equivalent to about 25% of global GDP [2]
87% of merchant executives see cross-border online sales
as their biggest growth potential [3]

Remittances to low and middle income countries are estimated to have increased
10.2% in 2021, and a further 4.9% in 2022 to reach $626bn [4]
Remittances inflows can be as high as 50% of GDP for some countries [4]

The G20 identified enhancing cross-border payments as a priority
in 2020 and set out a Roadmap of actions

Many, but not all, cross-border payments face
challenges:

A number of Roadmap actions have already
been met

• High costs: remittance payments can cost
more than 10% of transfer value [5]

• Agreed global quantitative targets and
an implementation approach to monitor
progress in the speed, cost, access and
transparency.

• Slow speeds: payments can take up to 10
days to transfer between some jurisdictions [6]
• Limited Access: 29% of adults in developing
economies don’t have a financial account [7]

• Stocktakes and analyses of existing
payments systems / arrangements to lay
foundations for further work.

• Insufficient transparency: costs and speed
are often not known upfront and payments
cannot always be tracked

• Published proposals, best practices,
guidance and frameworks across
numerous wide-ranging building blocks.

In 2023, the Financial Stability Board announced an updated
Roadmap of priority actions to help meet the Targets by 2027
Payment
system
interoperability
and extension

Legal,
regulatory and
supervisory
frameworks

Central bank operators’
community of practice

Bank/non-bank regulation and
supervision

Faster payment system
interlinking across borders

Information to end-users

Cross-border payments service
level agreements / schemes

Anti Money Laundering (AML)
and Combatting the Financing
of Terrorism (CFT) application

Data exchange
and message
standards

Interaction with data frameworks
ISO 20022 harmonisation
requirements
Application Programming
Interface harmonisation
Legal Entity Identifier use

Actions being undertaken across all priority areas
Payments Summit

Technical assistance

Industry taskforces

Public sector outreach

Monitoring and progress reporting

Now is the time for public and private sector action to implement
practical projects and changes to processes and approaches
We need to work together globally to develop the vision and tools
and domestically to determine where progress is needed and how best to implement it

Is there a case to expand
the access to or operating
hours of key payment
systems?

Are there
opportunities for
interlinking

Could we amend
data standards /
formats to better
align internationally?

How do our legal,
regulatory and
supervisory frameworks
compare to others?

How can I help to achieve cheaper, fast, more accessible and more transparent
cross border payments?

In the UK, the Bank of England is renewing the Real-time Gross
Settlement (RTGS) service
• The new RTGS core ledger and settlement engine will be introduced in Summer 2024, with a
strong focus on resilience, competition and innovation – and benefits to cross-border payments
ISO 20022 adoption
•
•

CHAPS migrates to ISO20022 on 19 June 2023
The Bank of England will mandate use of structured data from 2025

Expanded Access
•
•

Making onboarding easier to increase access to new participants
Policy changes to include Non Bank Payment Service Providers and Omnibus accounts, already made

Enhanced user functionality e.g. APIs
•

Enhanced, more flexible functionality

Capability to Extend Service Availability
•

Technical capability to support 22x5 operation with settlement windows on weekends, and no technical
barriers to moving to near 24x7 operation in the future.

• The Roadmap for RTGS beyond 2024 sets out further enhancements and a range of potential new
features that could benefit cross-border payments (synchronisation, extended operating hours)
