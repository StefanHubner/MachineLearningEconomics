Introduction
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be here in Cardiff where, it
seems, you have had your fair share of MPC speeches of late. But I am certain
that this is a reflection of Welsh hospitality. It is also a measure of the
importance that MPC members attach to making their presence felt outside
London and I am here primarily to gain a better understanding of what is
happening to the Welsh economy.

The MPC sets the Bank Rate for the whole of the United Kingdom. But we are
only too aware that the economic picture varies by sector and region. Our job
on the MPC is to aggregate a wide range of information when we form our
judgement about the best course of action for the UK as a whole to achieve the
inflation target of 2% CPI inflation set for us by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The role of monetary policy is to achieve price stability by
balancing aggregate demand and potential supply in the UK economy.

My speech today is about one specific aspect of the supply side of the UK
economy and its implications for growth and inflation. It is a long-term
pattern (of more than fifty years standing) and one that you I am sure are all
too aware of here in Wales – the structural shift of the UK economy from
manufacturing towards services. In Wales, you have seen the share of
market services in gross valued added – that is services taking out
government services – rise from 39% in 1996 to 48% in 2003.2

Below, I will discuss some implications of this for decisions about interest
rates. However, along the way, I will take the opportunity to comment on

The data from 2003 is provisional ONS data published in Regional Trends 39. Market
services nominal GVA are calculated as the sum of GVA at current prices for wholesale and
retail trades (including motor trades); hotels and restaurants; transport, storage and
communication; financial intermediation; real estate, renting and business activities; and
other services. The excluded sectors, for example education and health, have some market
activity in them.

some broader issues that arise from this structural shift that has taken place
over a lengthy period.

While I will take a longer-term perspective, the issue of the short-term relative
strength of manufacturing and services is a subject of on-going debate. The
recovery in the economies of the euro-zone since the beginning of 2006 helped
to provide an export-led boost to UK manufacturing after a prolonged period
of contraction especially evident in 2005 when, according to the official data,
manufacturing failed to grow in all four quarters. However, data for the very
end of last year, for example from the CIPS/RBS manufacturing and services
surveys, suggested rather less evidence of a rebalancing of the economy
between services and manufacturing with the service sector once again
stealing the lime light.
Structural Change in the UK Economy
Chart 1.1 illustrates the familiar story. It shows the manufacturing and
services share of UK gross value added at factor cost between 1960 and 2004.
Chart 1.2 shows the same thing between 1985 and 2004 where the data is
measured on a fully consistent basis. Both show an increase in market
services, i.e. services excluding government. This increase is from a little less
than 50% of gross value added in 1985 to more than 60% in 2004. Most of this
is a relocation of economic activity from manufacturing to services. It is
broadly reflected in the share of employment in the UK economy which is
now about 11% in manufacturing.

But market services are a heterogeneous group of economic activities
including goods produced and consumed as services (such as restaurants),
those that facilitate the production and consumption of other goods (such as
retailing) and those that are inputs into other kinds of production (like
financial services). Chart 1.3 decomposes services output into four main
sectors: distribution, hotels and catering; business and financial services;
transport and communication and other market services. It is clear from this
that the increase in business and financial services accounts for the lion’s
share of the growth. Chart 1.4 shows this more clearly still when we look at
contributions to the growth of real value added across the UK economy. It
shows how business and financial services have been important to growth in
output in the United Kingdom from the 1990s onwards.3 The growth of outsourcing may be an important explanation of this trend, explaining why the
combined share of gross value added from business services and
This real income measure is nominal GDP value-added deflated by the consumption
deflator. The total of contributions across sectors does not include the financial services
adjustment (FSA). This would differ from aggregate real GDP even without the financial
services adjustment whenever the GDP deflator diverges from the consumption deflator. But
the two are different concepts. A real GDP value-added measure aims to capture the
contribution to output growth of the value-added inputs in each sector only. The real income
measure captures the contribution of each sector to the growth in UK real income generated.
A broader measure of real income would include net income earned abroad. See Cassing
(1996), Diewert (2005) and Duguay, P (2006) for an explanation of the real income measure.
See Tily and Jenkinson (2006) for an explanation of the FSA.

These facts are important in thinking through how structural changes affect
growth and inflation in the UK economy. Business and financial services are
an important intermediate input into other economic activities in the United
Kingdom and are not just consumed directly. The share of the sector’s gross
output which is an intermediate is about 60%. That said, this sector accounts
for 20% of household final demand, although a single item – imputed and
actual housing rents – accounts for 70% of this. Overall, services have become
more important in consumption in the United Kingdom – though they are
still a less important component in CPI than are goods (Chart 1.5)

It is useful to set this in an international context. Chart 1.6 shows that the
trend in the United Kingdom, while similar to other advanced economies, is
more pronounced. The increase in the share of market services in the United
Kingdom has been greater than that in France, Germany, Italy and the United
States and its share of market services is now larger than in all of these
countries. Thus, although other advanced economies have also experienced

6

the trend towards services, this has been greater in the United Kingdom.
Moreover, this is in the context of ten years or more of economic stability and
growth for the UK economy.

Note: The OECD measure of UK market services GVA, though
internationally comparable, may be based on earlier vintages of National
Accounts data than that used in Chart 1.2.

In looking at data of this kind, it is important to acknowledge a degree of
arbitrariness in whether businesses are classified as producing goods or
services. A manufacturing firm that out-sources its production abroad while
retaining marketing, design and distribution in the United Kingdom could
easily be regarded as a service sector firm even though its final output is a
good.
Services and Economic Prosperity
The trend documented above is often referred to as “deindustrialisation”.
When I was first a student of economics in the early 1980s, there was much
discussion of this as an economic problem. It was often said that the UK
economy had “too few producers”. Moreover, it was taken to be a symptom
of long-run economic decline relative to other advanced economies. There
were even those who thought that an explicit policy of protecting

7

manufacturing jobs was needed to safeguard the standing of the UK economy
in the face of global competition.

Our understanding of the process of structural change and the sources of
growth has since moved on. This somewhat alarmist view of
deindustrialisation and its implications was based on three myths about the
service sector:

Myth 1: The level of productivity in the service sector is inevitably low
compared to manufacturing.

Myth 2: The service sector does not benefit from productivity improvements.

Myth 3: Moving towards the production of services must worsen the UK’s
net trade position.

I will discuss each of these views in detail below and I will explain why I
regard each of them to be a myth. But it will help if I set the scene. For this I
require a brief digression on the general issue of what drives economic
prosperity in a modern global economy.

Most production uses a mixture of goods and services as inputs. It is useful to
view the production process through the metaphor of a ladder.4 Towards the
bottom of the ladder are relatively simple production processes, while
towards the top are processes that are more complex and specialised.
Different outputs – be they goods or services – use different production
ladders.

The main idea is illustrated in Figure 1 which gives an example of a
manufacturing final good (aircraft manufacturing) and a final service (an
airline). Within each there is a ladder with low and high value added services
4

See, for example, Grossman and Helpman (1991).

associated with them. The Figure gives some concrete examples of goods and
services at different rungs on the ladder.

Increasing the number of rungs on the ladder is a metaphor for technological
sophistication. Progress is also made by finding ways of producing or
sourcing goods or services at any point on the ladder that are cheaper and
better. One of the key economic decisions for any firm is which goods and
services to produce in-house and which to purchase in from other suppliers.

The sophistication in production that is possible in a given economy depends
upon the level of skills in the workforce, the availability of infrastructure,
access to capital and the “institutions” that enable stable business planning
and an effective legal and regulatory environment. These are the key
productive capacities that support economic success and progress in an
economy-wide sense. Looking across the world, the richest economies tend to
produce more goods and services towards the top of the world ladder while
those further down aspire to move up. In well-managed economies,
productive capacities expand over time and with them a move in production
to “higher rung” activities.

9

This view of what generates economic progress chimes well with recent
discussions about the importance of intangible capital in the investment
performance of the UK economy. An influential study by the US Federal
Reserve Board by Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2004), estimated intangible
investment to be around 13% of GDP in the late 1990s. Recent evidence for
the United Kingdom, by Marrano and Haskel (2006) suggests that around
11% of nominal GDP in 2004 is in the form of intangible investment. They
attribute half of this to efforts to build the “economic competences” of firms in
which they include firm-specific human and organisational capital. Other
researchers, such as Bloom and van Reenen (2006) have similarly emphasised
the importance of intangibles such as human resource management in firm
level productivity. Such intangibles are arguably areas where business
services may play a key role in improving productivity. While it is too early
to tell for sure, accounting for intangible investment may help to explain the
surprising weakness of UK business investment in the early part of this
decade.

Business services may also be important in changing the qualitative nature of
relatively standardised inputs into a product that is designed for the specific
needs of particular final and intermediate consumers. This typically involves
being located physically close to these consumers.5 But it also requires more
coordination, better institutions, more sophisticated contracts and a higher
level of skills from the workforce.

In recent years, we have seen all kinds of businesses outsourcing processes to
achieve lower costs and to take advantage of gains from specialisation. Some
of this is outsourcing of low value added activities, in part to low-wage
economies. But the growth of business services in the United Kingdom
reflects in part outsourcing of high value added activities which are high up
the production ladder allowing firms to take advantage of the specialised
skills available in business services. The latter, in particular, can be a source
5

See Hill (1999).

10

of productivity improvements. Business services are also often used directly
in the outsourcing process.

The relocation of some production across the globe benefits advanced
economies in two main ways. First, consumers and firms can buy these goods
more cheaply and second, labour can be freed up from low value added tasks
and redeployed further up the production ladder. The latter does require,
however, that the workforce has the skills to relocate in higher rung activities.

The forces unleashed by globalisation in Asia follow this pattern. China has
moved from a predominantly agricultural economy to labour intensive
manufactures. A more specific example from India is the production of car
seats which has been an enormously successful growth industry and India is
now one of the leading producers of car seats, selling them to many of the
world’s leading car manufacturers. But this is sustainable as a particular
point in the value chain, reflecting the endowments and opportunities of
Indian workers.

Much of the growth and structural change in the UK economy in recent years
can be captured with the quality ladder metaphor. Growth has been achieved
by moving into higher value added activities while reallocating resources
from those further down the value chain. The latter has not always been from
choice, with competitive forces playing a significant role in determining what
is viable in the face of world competition. You are only too aware in Wales of
the personal hardship that this can create. But the overall consequence has
been a transformation in the UK manufacturing sector and the growth in
services that I have documented above.

The achievements of the manufacturing sector over the recent period are
considerable even though it represents a smaller share of the UK economy. It
is clear that there are many success stories, and I have heard first hand about
some of them during my visit here. In such cases, manufacturers have found

11

their niche at a point in the value chain where they can exploit the
considerable human resources and opportunities available in the UK.

But recognising the contribution of manufacturing does not validate the
myths of deindustrialisation referred to above. I will briefly revisit each of
them and show how applying the way of thinking that I am suggesting
reveals each claim that I labelled as a myth above to be dubious.

To understand myth 1, that services are necessarily low productivity
activities, it is necessary to look beneath the aggregate picture. Chart 2.1
shows that on average, the real value-added income per service sector worker
is lower than in manufacturing. Such figures, taken at face value, would
perpetuate the myth that a movement towards services production must
impoverish the UK economy.

But looking at the market services’ sectors separately, a somewhat different
picture emerges. Not all service sector production is low value-added and
deploys workers less productively than in manufacturing. In terms of the
quality ladder metaphor, it is clear that many service activities are indeed
“high rung” economic activities. The UK’s strong global position in business
and financial services is a case in point. Chart 2.2 shows that real income per
head in this sector exceeds income per head in manufacturing.

However, there is a central challenge. Globalisation has made it more
difficult for less skilled workers whose jobs are more directly threatened by
global competition. Some service sector jobs are less immune to global
competition. Chart 2.2 shows that gross real value-added income per worker
in distribution, hotels and catering is lower than in manufacturing. This is
largely a reflection of these being relatively low-skilled sectors. Only by
improving the skill base – particularly through investments in education and
training – can this situation be changed.

12

The second myth is that services cannot benefit from productivity growth.
One way to view this is given in Charts 2.1 and 2.2, which look at the changes
in the level of real value added income per worker between 1985 and 2004.
Both charts show that productivity looked at this way has been rising in
services. The use of ICT is one important dimension of this. This is suggestive
that innovation in services is important and can be a source of economic
growth. This has been particularly important in business services which, as
we argued above, are a key intermediate input into other economic activities.

Finally, consider myth 3 that the growth in services is detrimental to the UK
trading position. It remains true that, relative to output, exports are higher in
manufacturing than in services. Moreover, many consumer services are
inherently non-tradable. For example, few people travel abroad to have their
hair cut or their clothes dry cleaned. However, business and financial services
make an important contribution to net trade. For example, the sector
accounted for a 23% share of UK exports in 2004. More generally, the
services’ trade balance was £23 billion in 2005, up from £9 billion in 1995.
These earnings can be exchanged for goods produced from abroad.

13

Moreover, these goods can frequently be purchased more cheaply from
countries that have a comparative advantage in producing them.

It is clear that services have become increasingly more globalised in recent
years. This is particularly evident since 1992 – the share of services exports in
GDP nearly doubled between 1992 and 2005 as shown in Chart 2.3. Services
exports and services imports together have increased from around 10% of
GDP to over 15% in the same period (Chart 2.4).

So let me summarise the story so far. The structural shift from manufacturing
towards services is consistent with increasing prosperity and growth for the
UK economy. What matters is not whether the output is in the form of
services or manufacturing – it is the move towards the production of higher
value added activities that enables the UK economy to progress. One of the
key challenges is to maintain the skill base and to develop the right kind of
business environment to permit continual movements of production up the
value chain. The stability created by sound monetary policy plays a key role
in delivering a favourable environment for business.

14

Services and Inflation
The discussion so far has focused on the real economy and the implications of
structural change in the UK economy for economic prosperity. But the
primary concern of the MPC is with inflation and setting interest rate policy
to achieve the inflation target. To do so effectively, we need to understand
the forces that lie behind patterns of change in the UK economy and to use
this to form a judgement of where inflation is going over the medium run.
The kind of broad trends that I have described above are a part of the
background against which interest rate policy is set.

Let me begin with the following “eye-catching” fact about UK inflation which
appears relevant to the discussion so far. Chart 3.1 shows that, since 1997,
there has been a persistent tendency for the rate of inflation in consumer
services to run ahead of the rate of inflation in consumer goods.

It is worth noting that the UK experience depicted seems to be quite different
from other advanced economies. To see this, I refer you to charts 3.2 to 3.7
which compare the rate of consumer service price inflation and consumer
goods price inflation for the United Kingdom with that in France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States. None of these other countries shows a

15

pattern that is anything like as clear-cut as the pattern that we see in the
United Kingdom. 6

When it comes to constructing a price index for services, there are a number
of issues to be confronted. Some services, like haircuts, are fairly easy to
define. But others present challenges. Take the case of the banking sector
which was estimated to be around 5.2% of UK GDP for 2003. The difficulty
lies in defining the output of banks. In principle, it is the flow of services that
the bank provides to its customers. But calculating this flow, and then the
corresponding price deflator, is not straightforward. One reason is that while
there may be charges on some kinds of bank accounts, generally banks
“charge” by paying a lower return on deposits than they lend at. The ONS
has to extract a measure of user cost from data on the stock of deposits, loans,
wages, fees and interest rates.

Oulton (2004) and Allen (2005) highlight the methods by which this can be
done. For example, the output measure of indirectly charged services is
mainly the value of deposits plus loans. To derive the experimental Banking
Service Producer Price Index (the average price per loan and interest bearing
deposit) from this, the number of large businesses outside of financial
intermediation is used as a proxy for the number of loans and deposits. There
are also issues when it comes to factoring services into National Accounts.

17

For example, banking output needs to be allocated between domestic
households, government, overseas residents and intermediate demand.7

In summary, although services are now a large part of our economy and a
crucial intermediate and final output, there are aspects of services
measurement – both price and quantity – that are inherently more difficult
than in the case of goods. This has implications for a body like the MPC and
its attempts to understand what is happening in the UK economy.

Returning to Chart 3.1, there is a standard cost-based story, due to Baumol
(1967), which explains why the relative price of labour intensive services will
tend to increase over time. If such services do not benefit from significant
labour saving technological change and wages are rising in the economy due
to technological progress elsewhere, then we will tend to see this happening.
This is sometimes referred to as “Baumol’s law”.

Baumol’s law is also consistent with a larger share of national income being
devoted to the production of services over time. This is because the demand
for consumer services, restaurant meals being a good example, rises
disproportionately with income.8 Increased labour productivity in the nonservice sector makes consumers as a whole richer and can lead to a larger
share of income being devoted to consumer services even though services are
becoming relatively more expensive.

This view of what drives the finding in Chart 3.1 is certainly plausible for an
array of consumer services such as restaurants or hairdressers. But it is rather
incomplete as an explanation of what has been happening to services in the
United Kingdom. First, as we have already observed, much of the shift

This allocation is related to the treatment of Financial Intermediate Services Indirectly
Measured. See Tily and Jenkinson (2006).
8 For example, Blundell, Pashardes and Weber (1993) estimate an income elasticity of demand
of services by households of between 1.2 and 1.4 using data on 61,000 households from the
British Family Expenditure Survey for 1970-84.

towards service sector output is in the form of producer services. In fact,
service sector producer prices seem to be increasing at a higher rate than
consumer goods prices – see Chart 3.8. This may be because, just as with final
consumers, intermediate consumers spend a larger share of their revenue on
services even as those services become relatively more expensive. And if such
services are required more intensively further up the quality ladder, then this
is consistent with business services also growing in importance. But such
services may still be able to generate value-added income as wages, profits
and returns on capital, and pass less on to their intermediate and final
consumers.

demand by national accounts convention.

However, there is another issue raised by Chart 3.1 which goes more to the
heart of the judgements that concern the decisions made by the MPC. The
trend observed in Chart 3.1 constitutes a change in the relative price of
consumer services and consumer goods while inflation refers to changes in
the overall price level. What we can learn about relative price changes for
overall inflation has been much debated. It is one of the main issues that has
resurfaced in recent discussions about how monetary authorities should
respond to the rise in energy prices, which is also a relative price change.

19

The rate of inflation is not determined in any one sector of the UK economy
but by the balance of demand and potential supply in the UK economy as a
whole. To keep inflation to the 2% target does not imply that all prices are
rising at 2% - but that they do so on average. Experience of inflation “on the
ground” can be very different. We have heard plenty about the fact that
pensioners, young single people and middle class school-fee paying
households experience inflation differently. But I have in mind something
quite different – this is the fact that producers, who ultimately choose when to
put up prices, experience different patterns of wage inflation and increases or
falls in costs. Even in a world of stable inflation, there will be quite different
underlying patterns of wage and price increases.

Returning to Chart 3.1, there is some evidence that it is the overall demand
and supply conditions that determine the level of CPI inflation. Consumer
services inflation and consumer goods inflation generally appear to move in
opposite directions. This is quite unsurprising when consumers need to
choose what to spend out of a given money income so that rising prices in
some items implies less spending on others. Such rebalancing of consumer
priorities has been an inevitable consequence of the recent increase in energy
prices.

But even though it is the overall balance of supply and demand that matters,
there are good reasons for assessing the current state of the UK economy by
looking separately at goods and services. In particular, we are accustomed to
the manufacturing and services sector moving at different speeds in the
United Kingdom. Recent evidence suggests that the services sector is
growing more strongly than manufacturing (see charts 3.10 and 3.11).
However, in mid-2006, the pick-up in the euro-zone economies gave a boost
to manufacturing which promised the possibility of some rebalancing
between the service and manufacturing sector.

20

When the MPC assesses the state of the UK economy, it relies on a wide range
of indicators. ONS data on output in manufacturing and services of the kind
that we see in Chart 3.10 is an important source. The recovery in
manufacturing through 2006 is clearly visible from this. However, such data
are available with a lag and are often subject to revision. Survey data from
the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) provide an
important additional source of intelligence. Chart 3.11 contains an additional
quarter of data and shows that while still moving in a positive direction, the
CIPS/RBS manufacturing output indicator declined somewhat towards the
end of 2006. This contrasts with the CIPS/RBS service sector output indicator
which has produced its highest reading for nearly ten years. While it is
dangerous to put too much weight on a single number, this suggests a fairly
robust picture.

A key issue in assessing the balance of supply and demand in the economy
concerns the extent of capacity utilisation in the economy. One way of getting
a feel for this is from a variety of surveys administered to the manufacturing
and service sectors. A typical question asked to a firm is “Are you currently
operating: At full capacity/Below full capacity? “. While quite crude,

21

answers to these questions can be aggregated to give an economy-wide
picture of spare capacity. An additional uncertainty in measuring spare
capacity in the United Kingdom at the current time is that, with a plentiful
supply of migrant labour, the concept of spare capacity is perhaps less welldefined than in the past.

It is sometimes suggested that it is inherently more difficult to make such
judgements in the service sector and hence, as the service sector grows as a
share of the economy, our estimates of spare capacity become ever more
imprecise. While it is correct that the surveys may give only an imprecise
reading on the overall level of spare capacity, I don’t subscribe to the view
that the answers to these questions are less informative than similar questions
answered for manufacturing. Historically, the coverage of the service sector in
these surveys has, however, been less comprehensive, although we do now
have a wider range of survey indicators to assess the state of the service
sector.

There does, however, appear to be some relevant information in some such
series. Chart 3.12 matches Bank of England Agents’ scores for service sector
capacity utilisation against business-to-business service price pressures
between 2005 and 2006 suggesting that there might be a relationship between
the two.

constraint scores are over the next six months. Before January 2005, this score reflected companies’ current
situation, rather than being forward looking.

Charts 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15 plot the available series on capacity utilisation in
manufacturing and services since 1997 from a variety of surveys. The general
story is one in which capacity utilisation in services has been tighter in the
period since 2004 than in the preceding three years. The CBI and BCC
measures also show some modest tightening of capacity in manufacturing
over the same period.

Putting all of this evidence together, we might reasonably expect inflationary
pressure at the current time to be coming more from the services sector in the
economy in part driven by limited spare capacity. Moreover, shortages of
skilled labour in these sectors may lead to upward pressure on wages for such
workers. Evidence from the BCC survey suggests that the percentage of
service sector firms reporting recruitment difficulties is currently close to its
average.9 To the extent that the economy is operating in a single labour
market, this may lead to generalised wage pressure that will ultimately affect
all firms in the economy.

I turn, finally, to a brief discussion of globalisation and its implications for
services. There has been much recent discussion of globalisation and its
implications for the UK economy as a whole and its implications for inflation.
See Bean (2006). Most directly purchased consumer services are non-traded
services and hence largely immune from the forces of global competition. But
business services are not. We are only too familiar with relocation of call
centres to low labour cost environments. Just as in the case of manufacturing
that I discussed earlier, this should be thought of as a movement along the
9

See Bank of England (2006).

24

value chain allowing for labour in the United Kingdom to be redeployed
more productively. It is consistent with the quality ladders view of economic
change that I discussed above.

A frequently made argument is that global forces in the 1990s created
favourable “tailwinds” by reducing the prices of many kinds of manufactured
goods. This may be a feature of trade in services and, we have already
observed, there has been an increase in the share of trade devoted to services
in the past 15 years or so. It remains uncertain whether greater global
competition in services will limit service sector price increases in future.
However, whether or not this comes to pass, it is important to remember that
the assessment of inflationary pressure requires looking at the balance
between demand and supply overall.

In summary: we have observed a tendency for consumer services price
inflation to run ahead of consumer goods price inflation over the past ten
years. However, this does not imply an inflationary bias in the structural
change from the production of services to goods. Changes in CPI depend on
the balance of demand and supply factors in the economy as a whole.
However, the current strength of the service sector, as evidenced in the
survey data to which I have referred, is germane to judgements about the
current strength of the UK economy.
Concluding Remarks
This speech has focused on some broad trends in the UK economy that are
likely to continue. I have argued that the growth of business and financial
services is not necessarily damaging jobs and prosperity in the UK. Let me be
clear that I am not trying to downplay the important role played by
manufacturing in the United Kingdom. But the general context is one in
which prosperity is maintained in both services and manufacturing by

25

improving the skills base and business climate to support movements
towards higher value added economic activities.

The forces of globalisation will continually put pressure on activities that are
exposed to international competition. The United Kingdom is full of
businesses – both manufacturing and services – that have shown themselves
to be more than equal to the challenge of globalisation. The United
Kingdom’s economic performance from the 1990s onwards is one of an
orderly structural shift in a context of broad macro-economic stability and low
inflation. There is little reason to believe that this will change in the future
provided that the fundamentals remain in place.

The rise of the service sector has created challenges for the ONS which has to
keep ahead of structural changes in the UK economy. As an MPC member, I
will continue to keep my eye on the bigger picture and the forces that shape
the balance of demand and potential supply in the economy as a whole. The
fact that manufacturing series are more readily available and better measured
should not give them undue emphasis in policy discussions.

One of the forces behind the success of the MPC since 1997 is the level of
intelligent debate, analysis and commentary that the MPC has encouraged.
The MPC does not only have to make the right policy decision, it also has to
provide guidance about economic trends so that decision makers throughout
the economy can interpret their implications. The minutes of the meetings
provide a key vehicle for communicating the views of the committee. Those
of our latest policy meeting, which will be published on January 24th, will
explain the thinking behind last week’s decision to raise Bank Rate by 25 basis
points. The December minutes made clear the concerns about upside risks to
inflation among some members of the MPC. Our decision this month must be
viewed in that context and financial markets had already been pricing in an
increase of around 25 basis points for February.

26

I have learned during my short tenure that there is an appetite for stories
about process and personalities on the MPC. However, it is the economic
issues that count in our decisions and following them provides the best guide
to where interest rates are going. I accepted the invitation to join the MPC last
summer on the premise that I would exercise my independent judgement in
assessing what the data are telling us about trends in the UK economy. My
decisions will be guided by this alone. This means recognising that we are
uncertain about many things. But we do not live in a world that defies
interpretation and uncertainty is not an excuse for inaction. The structural
changes that have taken place, and will continue to take place, in the UK
economy are important. Understanding them in a wider context does, I
believe, lead to better policy.
