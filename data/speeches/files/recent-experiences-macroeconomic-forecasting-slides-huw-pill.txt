PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure.) For the euro area we use final consumption expenditure for household and non‐profit institutions serving households. Trend line estimated using 2012‐2019 data.

(a) Spot price is the one‐day forward price of UK natural gas, as of 21 June 2023. The projections in May 2023, February 2023 and November 2022 are conditioned on wholesale gas prices
following futures curves. These futures curves were the 15 working day averages to 28 April 2023 and 24 January respectively for May and February 2023 and the seven working day average to
25 October 2022 for November 2022. The projections in August 2022 were conditioned on wholesale gas prices following the futures curve in the 15 working days to 26 July for the first six
months and then remaining constant.

Typical frequency of price changes
Sources: DMP Survey and Bank calculations. The latest data are from the May 2023 Survey. The results on frequency of price changes are based on the question: ‘Approximately how often did your prices
change in each of the following years?’. Respondents were then asked to choose one of the following options for both year 2019 and 2022: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half‐yearly, annually, and prices did
not change.

Sources: DMP Survey and Bank calculations. Three‐month moving averages. Realised price growth (lines) are responses to the question: ‘Looking back, from 12 months ago to now, what was the approximate
% change in the average price you charge, considering all products and services?’. The latest data are from the May 2023 Survey. Expected price growth (diamonds) are responses to the question: ‘Looking
ahead, from now to 12 months from now, what approximate % change in your average price would you expect in each of the following scenarios: lowest, low, middle, high and highest?’, and respondents are
asked to assign a probability to each scenario which is used to create a weighted average expectation of price growth..
