suggestions, and to my colleagues in the Bank of England, other countries and in the IMF for
stimulating conversations during and around more meetings than I care to remember. An earlier
version of this speech, entitled “International Capital Flows: Opportunities and Challenges", was
presented on 2 June 1999 to the Commonwealth Symposium on Liberalisation of Financial
Services.

Introduction

One of the roles which international financial officials are sometimes required to play is to describe
disasters as triumphs and to make the dramatic seem bland. So, on 16 September 1992, following
massive speculation against sterling and its suspension from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the
then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, opened his statement with the words: “Today
has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day”. In the seven years since, several finance
ministers have had cause to echo those words. Officials have spoken of the risks associated with
capital flows. Well they might. Sharp reversals of capital flows to emerging markets have caused
crises with a frequency and on a scale that threaten support for an open, market-led international
economy.

These crises have created millions of victims, whose circumstances and aspirations were totally
unrelated to financial markets. In Korea unemployment tripled, in Indonesia several years of
economic growth were wiped out leading to political instability, and similar results have been
visible in other parts of Asia as well as LatinAmerica. Over the past century, governments in the
industrialised world have, in the wake of domestic financial crises, taken steps to regulate and
strengthen the financial system. Is there a similar need to change the rules of the game for the
international financial system?

Capital markets do not operate on their own. They need an adequate legal and supporting
infrastructure for participants to engage with each other. There is no magic wand that can be
waved to create such an infrastructure internationally. Short of a world authority what is required
is a patient process of building such an infrastructure. Some have described this as a need for new
architecture; others as a need for plumbing. I prefer to speak of bricklaying. But after
innumerable meetings of ministers and governors, deputies, deputies’deputies and so on, we still
do not have an adequate building. Recent crises have shown that the need is not for a lavish palace
but simply a roof over our heads. We need to get to the point where less time is spent on the role
of the IMF in handling crises and more on the role of the World Bank in promoting development.
So where should we start?

2

In order to answer that question it is necessary to understand the causes of recent crises. Without
pretending to be comprehensive, I shall focus attention on the importance of balance sheets –
national balance sheets – as the trigger for financial crises. I shall discuss four issues. First, I shall
try to identify the problems underlying recent financial crises. Second, I shall discuss two
fundamental or purist solutions which, although infeasible in the short run, do provide us with
some ideas about how we might deal with these problems in our imperfect world. Third, I shall
describe some practical steps – a “middle way” –to improve the international financial system.
These are the bricks which are slowly being laid in place. Fourth, in the context of the middle way,
I shall argue that transparency is of crucial importance. Notwithstanding the weaknesses in
domestic policies pursued by a number ofemerging market economies, there is a structural fault in
the nature of international capital flows. Short-term debt flows, especially bank finance, are highly
volatile. Unless that problem is tackled the potential for future crises will remain.
2

What is the source of the problems?

“Small open economies are like rowing boats on an open sea. One cannot predict when they might
1

capsize.” So wrote Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist at the World Bank. He also likened the
international financial system to aroad which, after too many accidents, raises more doubts about
the design of the road than the drivers involved. The analogy with travel has been taken up by
Larry Summers, who compared global financial markets with jet aeroplanes. Travel is faster and,
on the whole, safer. But crashes, when they do occur, are more spectacular. Whichever form of
travel you prefer, one thing is clear. In recent years, the passengers have suffered from severe
travel sickness. So much so, that their journey towards an open capital market has seemed, at
times, a nightmare.

The core of the problems faced by a number of emerging markets has been the sharp reversal of
capital flows. Between 1996 and 1998, the reversal of capital flows to the five Asian countries
primarily affected (Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) was of the order of
$125 billion, equivalent to 12% of the pre-crisis level of GDP. These reversals imply equal and
opposite swings in the current account. To turn a large current account deficit into a substantial
surplus within two years almost certainly requires a recession. In 1998 real GDP fell by 6% in
Korea, by 9% in Thailand, by 14% in Indonesia, by 7% in Malaysia, and by 1% in the Philippines.

Moreover, the reversal of capital flows to emerging markets means that the industrialised countries
must in aggregate run a larger trade deficit. The distribution of that increase in the collective
deficit has already led to a debate about appropriate domestic policies in the G7, making it harder
to resist the ever present protectionist pressures, especially in election years. So rapid reversals of
capital flows bring substantial economic costs.

Capital flows also bring real economic benefits. They enable savings in one country to finance
more profitable investment in another. That was a key feature of the world economy in the
nineteenth century. Such flows also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise. And by
investing overseas, domestic residents are able to pool risks of various kinds with residents of other
countries. To date, international diversification of portfolios has been remarkably limited. In
particular, equity portfolios of investors in the industrialised world are heavily biased towards
domestic equities. In part, this reflects the difficulty of obtaining adequate information about the
legal, accounting and other aspects of the infrastructure of economies overseas. But the failure to
exploit the full benefits of an open capital market reflects also the instabilities resulting from the
volatility of short-term capital flows.

The volatility of capital flows has affected not only Asia but also Latin America, and almost all
emerging markets have suffered directly or indirectly as spreads on their debt have risen to levels
that in some cases have come close to cutting them off from the international capital market
altogether. Indeed, Eisuke Sakakibara, formerly of MOF in Japan, has insisted that the past five
2

years have been a “crisis of global capitalism”. The so-called “Washington consensus” that sound
macroeconomic and financial policies should embrace the free movement of capital has come under
fire. Both Mexico and Korea, regarded as models of development to such an extent that they were
admitted to the OECD, experienced damaging crises shortly after their elevation to the premier
league of advanced economies. Contrast their fate with that of India. Capital controls insulated
India to a large extent from the recent crisis. If we cannot find a way to reconcile free movement
of capital with prevention of financial crises, then many countries may draw the lesson that they are
better off with capital controls – either explicit or implicit – than without. Over the past decade,
the two-year swing in the current account among G7 countries has been of the order of 1-2% of
GDP. The largest swing was less than 4% (3.7% for Italy over the period 1992-94). These are
small compared with the swing of 17% for Korea, in 1996-98.

Two dimensions of the reversal of capital flows have been evident in recent experience. First, their
intensity and scale. Second, the rapid contagion from one emerging market to other previously
unaffected countries. Both phenomena are a product of the nature of the capital flows concerned.
The problems arise from short-term flows of debt finance, not long-term equity flows or direct
investment.

Equity investment has a self-stabilising mechanism. When an investor wishes to withdraw from the
equity market he or she has to find a buyer before they can head for the exit. The market price
adjusts in order to attract a buyer to replace the seller. The physical investments financed by equity
flows remain in place, even if their value on the market has fallen. The need to find a buyer to
replace a seller can be expressed in the equivalent statement that the maturity of the liability is
extremely long, in this case indefinite. The real problems stem from liabilities with very short
maturities. These occur with debt finance, whether in terms of bank deposits payable on demand
or longer-term debt finance which has almost run to maturity. In these cases, depositors who wish
to withdraw their funds do not have to find replacement depositors. They simply take their funds
out. The result is that, if this rush to the exit is on a sufficiently large scale, banks find themselves
on the receiving end of a liquidity run. Such runs can occur even if the fundamentals are sound,
although they are more likely when the fundamentals are weak. And the banking systems of some
emerging markets compounded the problem by borrowing in foreign currency at short maturities
and investing the proceeds in domestic currency assets at longer maturities. This was indeed a
recipe for instability.

The importance of short-term debt finance in the reversal of capital flows in recent years is clear.
Virtually the whole of the $125 billion reversal of flows to the five Asian crisis countries was
accounted for by swings in short-term debt finance. And 80% of this swing resulted from changes
in the net flow of finance from commercial banks. Figures from the Institute of International
Finance suggest that the same picture is true for a larger group of emerging markets, with 81% of
the decline in private net capital flows to the 29 most important emerging market economies
accounted for by bank lending.

Liquidity runs, although not the sole cause of problems, did play a major part in recent financial
crises. Such runs reflect mismatches in the national balance sheet. Such mismatches can occur in
either the public or private sectors. An example of the former is Mexico in 1994, where short-term
official dollar denominated debt exceeded foreign exchange reserves. Examples of the latter are

5
Thailand, Korea and Indonesia in 1997, where the private sector had borrowed short in order to
lend long. Either maturity or currency mismatches create the potential for sudden reversals of
capital flows on a huge scale. In the technical jargon, such markets are subject to multiple
equilibria where a small event can cause a shift from one benign equilibrium state to another which
is accompanied by rapid capital outflows. The possibility of a rapid shiftfrom one equilibrium to
another explains, in the words of Maurice Obstfeld, “why capital markets can appear to impose too
3

little discipline before the crises arise, and too harsh a discipline afterwards”.

If this diagnosis is correct, two observations follow. First, capital flows in the form of foreign
direct investment and portfolio equity investment should be encouraged. Emerging markets can do
a great deal to increase these by adopting modern accounting standards, a transparent legal
framework, and a stable market-friendly environment to which foreign investors will be prepared to
commit long-term investments. Second, ways must be found to reduce the volatility of short-term
flows of bank finance. The key is to avoid maturity and currency mismatches on the national
balance sheet. That is easier said than done, and similar mismatches on the balance sheets of
domestic financial institutions have caused financial collapses on a regular basis in the industrialised
world.

Before turning to the question of how such mismatches might be limited if not prevented, let me
mention two other contributory factors to recent crises. The first was overvalued real exchange
rates, reflecting attempts to maintain fixed nominal exchange rates beyond their economic shelf life.
Not only did such attempts contribute to a crisis when the nominal peg could no longer be
sustained, but they also contributed to the illusion that it might be profitable to borrow at lower
interest rates in foreign currency and invest at higher rates domestically, thus exacerbating the
balance sheet mismatches. The second is that capital outflows do not result solely from the actions
of overseas residents. Capital flight by domestic residents has been a factor in increasing the scale
of outflows from a number of emerging markets. It is important to focus on the nature of capital
flows not the nationality of investors concerned. Hence the resolution of crises involves more than
simply restructuring liabilities to foreign banks or overseas investors. The problems created by the
volatility of short-term debt flows require a structural solution.

3 Purist Solutions
3

Obstfeld, M. (1998), “The Global Capital Market: Benefactor or Menace?”, NBER Working Paper 6559, mimeo.

6

How can we design an appropriate infrastructure for the international capital market to prevent, or at
least limit the frequency of, crises? To return to our transport analogy, there is clearly a case for
eliminating blind spots on the road or lengthening the runway. But this is not enough. We also need to
think about how the emergency services should respond to a crash.

The purist is led naturally to consider solutions of two opposite kinds. One, which maintains open and
free capital movements, is to create an international lender of last resort (ILOLR). The second, at the
opposite end of the spectrum, is to reinstate permanent capital controls.

Consider first the merits of an ILOLR. The obvious institution to play that role would be the IMF, and
its First Deputy Managing Director, Stanley Fischer, provided a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of
4

an ILOLR earlier this year . Although not new, the concept of an ILOLR has, in polite official circles,
become the facility that dare not speak its name.

The principle of a lender of last resort was described by Thornton and Bagehot in the nineteenth century
as a willingness to lend freely against good collateral at a penal rate. All three aspects of this principle –
“lending freely”, “good collateral”, and a “penal rate”, are problematic at the international level. An
effective LOLR must be willing to lend whatever it takes to preventa liquidity run. The more credible is
the LOLR, the less the resources that are required to be lent in practice. Domestic LOLRs have
credibility. But for a prospective ILOLR the decision for a group of countries, either jointly or via the
IMF, to lend large sums to another country will always be difficult. In a world of nation states, it is
unreasonable to suppose that political considerations will not enter the choice of recipient of such
largesse. And the greater the political uncertainty about the willingness to act as an ILOLR, the larger
the amount of funding that will be required. In turn, the operation will appear less credible, and the
authorities are caught in a vicious circle. The current resources of the IMF - between $125 billion and
$150 billion depending on how they are measured – are wholly inadequate for an ILOLR. Nor are
resources on the appropriate scale likely to be forthcoming.

Moreover, serious moral hazard arises when the private sector ignores the risks of lending to a country
because it believes that the country would be bailed out by the international community in the event of a
liquidity crisis. And investors are encouraged to lend to emerging markets in forms – short-term debt –
which are more likely to be bailed out. In the domestic context, the LOLR ensures that neither the
managers nor the equity holders of the institution receiving support are allowed to benefit.

7
Internationally, it is not easy for the IMF to penalise those responsible for management of the economy,
nor to distinguish between those citizens that have been responsible for excessive risk-taking and those
who will be the innocent victims of the consequences of a financial crisis. It is the ordinary taxpayers in
5

emerging market countries who will have to bear the burden of servicing loans from the IMF.

Absent a world government, it is difficult to see a credible ILOLR on the horizon. The basic reason is
the maxim: “it’s the politics, stupid”.

The second purist solution, at the opposite end of the spectrum, is the imposition of permanent
capital controls. In other words, a return to the world in which the Bretton Woods institutions
were created half a century ago. The advantage of capital controls is that they prevent the liquidity
runs that result from currency and maturity mismatch of the financial sector. India did not
experience a financial crisis, Korea did. They also enable countries to maintain a fixed exchange
rate while retaining some flexibility in domestic interest rates. And they might limit the movement
of capital to lower taxed jurisdictions, thus slowing the inexorable decline of capital income
taxation resulting from the development of a world capital market. But it is difficult to distinguish
between controls on capital flows and flows related to trade. The growth of trade in services has
highlighted the difficulty of separating currency trade-related flows from those representing
investment. Thus, to be effective, capital controls are likely to impede trade flows. This would be
a heavy price to pay and few countries have chosen to pay it.

Permanent capital controls have other disadvantages. They forsake all the economic benefits of a
free capital market. And controls are never implemented by wise, or even merely clever,
economists. They attract rent-seeking and corrupt behaviour in both official and private sectors.
And they undermine the cause of market liberalisation. There is no shortage of protectionist
tendencies that seek to limit trade and investment. We should not add to them.

Fischer, S. (1999) “On the Need for an International Lender of Last Resort”, IMF.
A point stressed by Calomiris (“The IMF’s Imprudent Role as Lender of Last Resort”, Cato Journal, Vol 17 No. 3
1998) although he underestimates, in my view, the possibility of liquidity runs as seen, for example, in Korea in
1997.

5

8
So neither purist solution is likely to appeal - the one because there is insufficient political and financial
support for an ILOLR, and the other because permanent controls go against the grain of promoting
market reforms and good governance.

But the present system is not sustainable. The danger is that we have the worst of both worlds. The
IMF may lend large amounts, create moral hazard in doing so, and still not be able to ward off the threat
of financial crises. And faced with a run on their currency or banking system, countries may be forced
to take unilateral action to suspend payments. So what to do?
4 The Middle Way
Given that neither purist approach is on the agenda, the international community has been trying to take
some practical steps forward. The aim is to reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises. Some
might describe this as muddling through. I prefer to call it the “middle way”. The difference is that the
middle way is based on the principle that if the emergency services will be slow toarrive then whichever
form of transport you care to think of, borrowing countries should drive slowly.

How to encourage and enforce careful driving has been the subject of innumerable international
meetings. Initially, the discussion took place in the G10, which, as you know, comprises eleven
countries. Then last year the discussion was taken up by the G22. By the spring of this year that group
had become the G33. Can you complete the sequence by guessing which international forum will take
the lead next year? Suffice it to say that at the original Bretton Woods conference there were forty-four
countries and it took place fifty-five years ago.
In terms of practical steps forward, it is useful to distinguish between theprevention and resolution of
crises. On the former, recent experience suggests five lessons for emerging markets:

(1)

Create a do it yourself (DIY) LOLR, with the aim of providing self-insurance against a liquidity

crisis. There are several ways of providing such insurance. One is simply to build up large foreign
currency reserves. This has already been taken to heart by emerging markets. China has substantial
foreign exchange reserves ($147 billion at the end of June). And Korea, perhaps the best example of a
country suffering a liquidity run on its banking system in terms of foreign currency, has raised its
reserves from a low point of $7.3 billion in November 1997 to a current high of $64.8 billion in August.
It is unfortunate that the absence of more efficient solutions to the risk of crises means that scarce
capital might be deployed in this inefficient way. Building up net reserves – via current account

9
surpluses - will reduce world demand at a time when the US economy is unlikely to provide as large a
stimulus as over the past five years. An alternative is to create gross reserves by borrowing from abroad
and investing the proceeds in liquid international securities. Both methods involve costs. A second
approach to DIY LOLR is for emerging markets to create contingent credit facilities with international
banks, as Argentina has done with its contingent repo facility, or try to set up collateralised loan facilities
4

along the lines suggested by Martin Feldstein. A final approach to the DIY LOLR, in the absence of an
effective multilateral ILOLR, is the creation of regional self-insurance funds. All of these approaches
are likely to be pursued, to a greater or lesser extent, in the wake of recent financial crises.

(2)

Manage the national balance sheet, and, as far as possible, avoid maturity and currency

mismatches. For a country without a track record of international borrowing, it is important to manage
its external liquidity position, especially in foreign currency. The lack of foreign exchange controls
means that it will be difficult to observe, let along manage, the balance sheet of the entire private sector.
But the key elements are those relating to the public and banking sectors. Governments already have
information on these sectors. As important as anything is the need for self-awareness by the countries
concerned of the state of their national balance sheet and the approach of impending liquidity difficulties.
When governments and markets alike are informed of the potential for future financing difficulties, both
sides have time to take preventive action. Of course, the use of derivative instruments and hedging
techniques makes the assessment of risk exposure more difficult. But the effort must be made.
Alan Greenspan has suggested that consideration be given to simple rules of thumb such as that
countries without a track record of international borrowing should maintain unencumbered foreign
exchange reserves sufficient to meet all foreign currency liabilities over the following year, and that the
average maturity of external liabilities should exceed three years. RudigerDornbusch has proposed the
use of value at risk assessments of country balance sheets. Ideas such as these, precisely because they
focus on the national balance sheet, are sure to be centre stage.

(3)

Encourage inflows of equity rather than debt finance. This is an extension of the need to

manage the national balance sheet. The imperative is the old adage: borrow long not short. A credible
legal and institutional infrastructure for private investors would go a long way to encourage equity
inflows. Reserve requirements on short-term debt inflows, as adopted in Chile, might help to modify the
pace of vulnerable capital inflows, but will, in themselves, do little to help in times of rapid capital
outflow. It is also time to reconsider the incentive to the provision of short-term finance provided by the
Basel Accord risk weights.

10
(4)

Promote the better design of debt contracts which provide a framework for negotiation between

creditors and debtors when financing difficulties arise. The particular proposal - advanced initially by a
G10 Deputies’report in 1996 and subsequently endorsed by the G7 - for the use of collective action
clauses in sovereign debt contracts has attracted interest. How far such clauses would help is unclear.
Bonds issued under UK, but not US, law – currently these account for just under 50% of the stock of
emerging market eurobonds – generally include such clauses already. But their widespread adoption
looks unlikely, not least because of the reluctance of the G7 to incorporate such clauses into their own
debt contracts. More productive in the short run is likely to be the promotion of regular contacts
between debtor countries and their creditors in good times, well before any crisis occurs.
State-contingent debt where returns are related to the price of major exports is another possibility.

(5)

Avoid, at all costs, the defence of fixed but adjustable exchange rate pegs when they are no

longer consistent with internal and external equilibrium. Thailand shows the cost of a prolonged and
ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend its exchange rate. Brazil shows that there is life after a fixed
exchange rate. It is much too early to conclude that emerging markets have little option but to adopt
the dollar as their currency.

To these five imperatives, I have refrained from adding the mantra of better banking supervision. Of
course, banking supervision should always strive to be better. But is it not time to ask the question of
whether the implicit government guarantee afforded to the banking systems of the major industrialised
countries is itself not part of the problem. One of the factors contributing to the scale of short-term debt
flows to emerging markets is the moral hazard implied by the financing of banks in the developed world.
It is certainly crucial that international rescue packages do not lead to moral hazard in the provision of
finance to emerging markets. But an important lesson for the G7 is that moral hazard starts at home.

In the resolution of crises less progress has been made. The IMF can, and has, provided financial
assistance without which the cost of recent crises to the affected countries would have been even
greater. But the stumbling block has been how “to involve the private sector”. Although the statement
by G7 finance ministers to the Cologne Summit in June set out both “principles” and “tools” for
involving the private sector in crisis resolution, much remains obscure. Unilateral debt moratoria can be
damaging in terms of future access to capital flows. But there will be circumstances in which a debtor
country and its creditors could benefit from a joint resolution of temporary payments difficulties, and
procedures are needed to prevent some creditors from free-riding on others. The following four
elements in crisis resolution merit some consideration. They have no particular status, but are issues that
need to be faced. The four are:

11

(i) the provision of official finance should be linked to the involvement of other creditors, including
the private sector, in the resolution of crises. This can be achieved by the IMF setting a floor
for the minimum level of foreign exchange reserves a country is required to maintain;

(ii) the aim of resolution is to find a co-operative solution negotiated between a debtor and its
creditors. No particular class of creditor should be in a privileged position, unless the
instrument in question explicitly gives it preferred creditor status;

(iii) the use of temporary standstills – possibly sanctioned by the international community - would
allow time for a country to negotiate with its creditors. In the absence of a formal mechanism
to achieve this, the IMF can indicate its endorsement of a standstill by being prepared to provide
new money to a country which has temporarily suspended payments to its creditors (often
referred to as IMF lending into arrears). By making standstills part of the furniture – or one of
the bricks – they would be seen not as an ad hoc response, which might lead to contagion in
other emerging markets, but part of an approved process;

(iv) measures, including perhaps strictly temporary capital controls, to prevent capital flight by
domestic residents in exceptional circumstances. It would be odd to sanction a standstill of
payments to foreign creditors while allowing domestic residents to move assets overseas
without restriction.

The essence of the middle way is to find practical steps forward to enable emerging markets better to
manage the liquidity positions of their external liabilities, and to reduce their dependence on debt
finance. Crises will still occur. But the aim is to reduce their frequency and severity. To that end there
is one further policy which is fundamental to the success of the middle way - transparency.

5 Transparency
Transparency is one of the most popular words in economic policy today. Much has been said about
transparency, and, interestingly, much has been done. Why is transparency so important? In itself,
transparency will neither prevent nor resolve financial crises. But transparency can help reduce the
frequency of crises – by alerting not only markets but also policy-makers to problems on the horizon –

12
and their severity – by minimising the surprises about the scale of any liquidity problems. In Korea, the
foreign currency exposure of its banking system was not known until after the crisis had hit. And in
Thailand, the true state of the foreign exchange reserves was unknown even to its own finance ministry,
let alone financial markets. So transparency can be seen as a “second best” policy when purist solutions
to financial crises are unavailable. It is in the context of the middle way that transparency comes into its
own.

The aims of transparency are to allow better informed decisions in both public and private sectors, to
reduce the risk of contagion by allowing markets to differentiate amongborrowers, and to encourage
macroeconomic policy to become more predictable. Transparency is not simply a question of making
available certain data. It is an approach to economic policy, almost a way of life. The G22 Report of
the Working Group on Transparency and Accountability (which I was privileged to co-chair with
Andrew Sheng of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) was published in October1998. Its
recommendations were endorsed in full by the G7. It stressed the importance of transparency in three
different sectors: national governments, the private sector, and the international financial institutions.
Good progress has been made in implementing many of its recommendations.

Rather than give an exhaustive account of progress in transparency, let me give a few examples. In
March of this year, the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard was strengthened by the inclusion of
a template covering the disclosure of net foreign exchange reserves and short-term foreign currency
liabilities of central government. These data are required to be published monthly with a lag of no more
than one month, and the transitional period for observing the standard runs to the end of March2000.
Agreement is close on a Code of Monetary Policy Transparency to match the earlier Code on Fiscal
Policy Transparency.

BIS data on international banking statistics will be produced quarterly from next spring, and the lag in
publication shortened. One of the three Financial Stability Forum Working Groups is considering the
quality and timeliness of disclosure of exposures to and of highly leveraged institutions. This category
includes hedge funds. Proposals for direct regulation of internationally mobile funds are unlikely to be
workable. But many commentators remain suspicious, regarding such funds as like children playing just
out of sight who are told – “I don’t know what you’re doing, but, whatever it is, stop it”.

The IMF itself has become more open about the release of information. During an eighteen month
experiment countries will be able to publish their ArticleIV reports. And more background information,
including policy papers and programme reviews, is now available. All this should improve the

13
transparency and accountability of national governments, the private sector, and the IMF.

But there is one further step on which progress is urgently required. In a world of sovereign states,
countries cannot, and should not, be compelled to disclose information if they do not wish to do so. But
countries should not be able to claim to be transparent when in fact they are not. A crucial substitute for
the inability to make transparency mandatory is that we need transparency about transparency. That is
why the G22 Report recommended that the IMF – in the context of its Article IV consultations –
prepare a Transparency Report for each country summarising the degree to which that economy
complied with disclosure standards and codes of conduct. The case for “transparency about
transparency” is the case for honesty in economic policy.
Some progress has been made. Pilot transparency reports on the UK and Argentina have been
produced by IMF staff. Other pilot reports are to come. Australia has published a self-assessment
transparency report. The need now is to make the production of Transparency Reports an integral part
of the Article IV process. There is no reason for further delay. Transparency Reports should always be
published. I very much hope that the IMF will make rapid progress towards the regular production and
publication of Transparency Reports on each country. This practical measure could do a great deal to
enhance the performance of all economic actors involved in the international capital market.
6 Conclusions
Unrestricted capital mobility and the absence of an ILOLRare not a recipe for a stable international
financial system. Short-term interbank flows are the Achilles heel of present arrangements, leading to
both currency and maturity mismatches. Throw in a predilection of emerging markets for pegged
exchange rates and you have a dangerous cocktail. Purist solutions - whether of an ILOLR or a return
to permanent capital controls – are, for good reasons, unlikely to be pursued. What is needed now are
some practical steps forward. Central to any such programme is the need to monitor and manage the
national balance sheet. The objective cannot be to eliminate the risk of financial crises. The middle way
will not do that. But it can reduce the frequency and severity of crises. In this context transparency is
important. There will still be crises in the future, but transparency will reduce their costs and help to
keep governments closer to the straight and narrow. All central bankers will surely welcome that.

Of course, the immediate crisis has receded, and some of the Asian countries, in particular, have
recovered sharply over the past year. But we should not be misled by the calm after the storm. There
will be future storms, and now is the time to prepare for them. There is no need for another
international conference of thekind which led to the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions. But

14
there remains a need for thinking as original and imaginative as that which inspired the Bretton Woods
conference. The middle way is a start, but no more.

David Ignatius has written about the “founding generation”, people such as DeanAcheson and George
C. Marshall, who created the great post-war institutions. All of those institutions have now passed their
fiftieth birthday. It is time to appraise carefully the architecture, foundations, plumbing and even
bricklaying of that inheritance. Ignatius described the qualities of the founding generation as “resolve
and clarity”. Those qualities are still required. DeanAcheson entitled his memoirs, “Present at the
Creation”. Let us hope that, similarly, a new generation of officials will be able, at some future date, to
look back at the creation of an open world economy in which financial crises were successfully
contained. That would be an achievement of which all economic bricklayers could be proud.
