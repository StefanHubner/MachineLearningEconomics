The experience of business investment in the UK since the onset of the financial crisis broadly matches that
elsewhere in the advanced world – a sharp fall followed by a feeble recovery (Chart 1). Peak to trough, the
level of UK business investment fell by 20%, and it was six years before it surpassed its pre-crisis level,
putting the recent experience at the bottom of the swathe of past UK cycles (Chart 2).
In my brief remarks today, I will offer some possible explanations for this performance before concluding with
comments on the outlooks for UK investment and monetary policy.
I. Investment since the crisis
In part, weak investment reflects a weak economy, with the recovery following the crash being the slowest
since the Great Depression.
Weakness in demand is not, however, the whole explanation. Business investment has underperformed
relative to output since the crisis, with the ratio of the two falling in the UK by around 2 percentage points in
the immediate aftermath (Chart 3), similar to the experience in other advanced economies.
1

Falls in investment tend to be more persistent for recessions associated with financial crises (Chart 4). This
partly reflects restrictions in credit supply constraining investment, as well as productivity, wages and
economic performance more generally.

2

But weak UK investment also reflected a necessary adjustment in the capital stock. That overhang – which
peaked at close to 10% in the UK – is being gradually worked off through a combination of a recovery in
output and a prolonged period of subdued net investment (Chart 5).
And in part weak investment could reflect a misallocation of capital in the run-up to the crisis. In this regard,
the situation in the UK was a bit different to that in countries such as Spain and the US where significant
residential and commercial property construction booms subsequently turned to busts. Without a housing
glut to work off, the weakness of UK investment is all the more striking.
Another form of misallocation could be the ability of so-called zombie firms to live on in the very low interest
rate environment. The BIS’s proxy for this has seen the share of the “living dead” more than double since
3

the crisis. In contrast, the Bank of England estimates that the proportion of zombie firms in the UK has
fallen by a quarter since 2008 (Chart 6).

Bank research (Franklin, Rostom and Thwaites, 2016), finds that the reduction in bank credit supply had an economically and
statistically significant effect on companies: a 10% fall in the amount a firm could borrow is estimated to have reduced capital per
worker by around 5-6%, labour productivity by 5-8% and wages by 7-9%, and increased the probability of bankruptcy by around 60%.

Increased uncertainty has undoubtedly contributed to weak investment. Confirming the adage that bad
things come in threes, companies have faced uncertainty about the economy, geopolitics, and economic
5

policy, all of which are likely to have clouded the outlook for how investments will perform (Chart 7).

Greater uncertainty about returns means that fewer investment projects will be seen as worthwhile. This
could help explain the “puzzle” of why hurdle rates in business investment have remained stubbornly high
despite the weaker secular outlook for growth implied, for example, by long-term bond yields. The answer
may be that the expected volatility of earnings growth has increased. As an illustration, a simple Black –
Scholes model suggests that the hurdle rate for expected returns is high – in the region of 10 percentage
6

points (Chart 8) –consistent with survey evidence for the UK (Chart 9). A 10-percentage point pick up in the
volatility of expected earnings could almost double that rate, swamping the impact of lower risk-free returns.
All of these explanations concern the legacy effects of the crisis, but secular forces may also be at work. For
example, over the past thirty years investment has shifted from fixed assets towards intangibles – such as
7

computer software, intellectual property, and research and development. This may have dampened the
traditional investment accelerator. Increases in demand are usually accelerated by increases in investment
– higher demand boosts companies’ profits, increasing their net worth and so allowing them to undertake
further investment, as well as stimulating incomes and spending further. A wide range of analysis suggests
that the shift towards intangibles has, however, dampened this effect, perhaps because intangible assets are
less suitable for use as collateral than physical assets, such as property.

8

The weakness in investment is of course linked to weak productivity. In the UK, while the most productive
companies have continued to innovate, others have become slower at adopting those innovations. That has
stalled diffusion of productivity gains through the economy (Chart 10). This shortfall in investment could
reflect deeper causes such as inadequate competition, barriers to investment in knowledge-based capital
and sub-optimal managerial practices.

Identifying the effect of increased uncertainty is complicated by the fact that it is usually accompanied by a tightening in financial
conditions. In this regard, the pickup in uncertainty following the referendum on EU membership in the UK was unusual, as financial
conditions eased, helped by a series of monetary and macro-financial policy measures taken by the Bank of England.

For individual firms, the standard variation of annual earnings was around 30 percentage points in the period before the crisis. See
‘Uncertain times’, speech by Ben Broadbent at the Wall Street Journal, 5 October 2016, available at
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf.
7
For example, estimates by the Bank for International Settlements suggest that between 1990 and 2016, the investment rate in fixed
assets declined from around 8% to 3½% of total assets, while the investment rate in intangible assets increased from around 7% in
1990 to 10% in 2016.
8
Various papers find evidence that intangibles investment is less responsive to changes in demand than investment in fixed assets. For
example, Masayuki (2015) estimates an accelerator-type investment model, where growth of the firm’s sales is included as regressor,
together with a measure of cash flow. The estimated “accelerator” coefficient is small and not statistically significant for intangible
investment, suggesting this effect might be absent. Estimates from regression analysis by BIS show that the sensitivity of investment to
investment opportunities (proxied by Tobin’s Q) is approximately three times more sensitive for physical investment than for intangible
investment – a result that the BIS suggest could be explained by “the structural lumpiness of intangible investment”. In a similar vein,
Ryan and Taylor (2017) also find that intangible capital responds more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. They conclude
that, compared with physical capital, intangible capital’s convex adjustment costs are roughly twice as large.

Although these secular forces may likely persist, many of the conditions for a revival in business investment
are now in place.
II. The Contribution of Central Banks to Investment
Recognising that the most important contributions will be from structural policies, how can central banks
support that belated investment recovery?
First, we must acknowledge that, while the cost and availability of finance matters; internal cash flows, the
profit outlook and uncertainty are far more important determinants of investment. Monetary policy affects
companies’ profits and cash flows through its effects on domestic demand and, via the exchange rate,
external demand. Given the importance of internal finance for investment, and the high hurdle rates
investment projects must clear, such indirect effects are more important for investment than the direct effects
on the cost of capital. The biggest contributions of central banks are therefore improving the demand and
profit outlooks and reducing uncertainty.
Allow me to use the current situation in the UK to illustrate these points.
UK output is now in sight of potential, and the capital overhang looks set to be eliminated over the next few
years. In order to expand, companies will increasingly need to invest.
A strengthening global economy should tempt UK companies to do so, particularly since UK companies are
generally competitive given the recent fall in sterling. Indeed, the broad-based global recovery is creating the
possibility of a self-reinforcing revival in investment. The Bank of England estimates that more than 80% of
the world economy is now growing above potential. Global measures of industrial production and capital
goods orders, as well as world trade, have strengthened markedly over the past year, suggesting some
rotation in the composition of global demand towards investment. With that more favourable outlook,
investment intentions are now rising around the world (Chart 11).
If these intentions are realised, the global equilibrium interest rate could rise somewhat, making a given
policy setting more accommodative. The extent to which it does will depend on other secular factors that
have been holding it down, including demographics, debt overhangs and the capital intensity of production.

10

In this generally constructive environment, the main issues facing UK companies are uncertainties – about
how consumers will adjust to a period of weaker real income growth; about market access post-Brexit; about
the potential risks in the transition to new arrangements with the EU and the rest of the world.

Among companies responding to the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel survey between February and April 2017, Brexit was the largest
current source of uncertainty for 10%, one of the top two or three sources of uncertainty for 30%, one of many drivers of uncertainty four
40% and not important for the remaining 20%.

context, the best contribution the Bank of England can make is maintaining financial and monetary stability
by pursuing the right policies within consistent frameworks.
In recent years, the Bank has been determined to remove any lingering uncertainties that companies may
have about access to finance in good times and bad. The Bank is building the resilience of the financial
system through much higher capital levels, more prudent underwriting standards, rigorous stress testing and
appropriate contingency planning. The core tier 1 capital ratios for major UK banks are now almost 14%
(Chart 12). Yesterday, the FPC increased the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5% from 0%, announced
higher expectations of lenders’ underwriting standards for consumer credit, and recalibrated the leverage
ratio. With detailed contingency planning for the financial stability impacts of Brexit, UK companies can be
confident of continued access to finance in an uncertain world.
Reforms mean the UK financial system is working well. Net lending to private companies is been growing
following six years of contraction. Corporate bond spreads are well below their long-run averages
(Chart 13). And credit conditions among SMEs have been steadily improving.
If the opportunities present themselves, UK corporates could readily draw on this finance as their balance
sheets are in good health following a decade of de-levering to ratios amongst the lowest in advanced
economies.

12

Turning now to monetary policy, the Bank operates within an established framework, anchored in the
inflation target (Chart 14). The MPC set out in advance of the referendum how it would apply that
framework, emphasising that the effects of the process of leaving the EU on inflation would depend on its
impact on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The Committee has repeatedly stressed that, as a result,
the implications for monetary policy would not be automatic.
The MPC has also clearly set out its reaction function consistent with its remit. Under the exceptional
circumstances Brexit entails (with an inflation overshoot driven entirely by an exchange rate depreciation
caused a large fundamental shock), the Committee is required by its remit to balance a period of abovetarget inflation with a period of weaker growth. As the primary objective of monetary policy remains inflation
control, any overshoot of inflation above the target can only be temporary in nature and limited in scope. As
such, the MPC has been clear that its tolerance for above-target inflation is limited.
Since the prospect of Brexit emerged, financial markets, notably sterling, have marked down the UK’s
economic prospects. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the
transition to new trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed
between job losses and price rises. And it can support households and businesses as they adjust to such
profound change.

As spare capacity erodes, the trade-off that the MPC must balance lessens, and, all else equal, its tolerance
for above-target inflation falls (Chart 15). Different members of the MPC will understandably have different
views about the outlook and therefore the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any
changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace.
When the MPC last met earlier this month, my view was that given the mixed signals on consumer spending
and business investment, it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent the slowdown in
growth would prove. Moreover, with domestic inflationary pressures, particularly wages and unit labour
costs, still subdued, it was appropriate to leave the policy stance unchanged at that time.
Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues
to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional. The extent to which the trade-off
moves in that direction will depend on the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other
components of demand including business investment, whether wages and unit labour costs begin to firm,
and more generally, how the economy reacts to both tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit
negotiations. These are some of the issues that the MPC will debate in the coming months.
III. Conclusion
After an expansion that has relied overly on consumption, the rotation to other components of demand,
particularly investment, will be important to sustain momentum. Stronger investment will support productivity
growth, stronger wages and higher welfare for all.
It will also give monetary policy more traction. Globally, there are signs that such a rotation may be
beginning. Although some UK–specific uncertainties might limit the UK’s participation in that pickup, the
Bank of England will make its contribution by pursuing determined policies within well-established
frameworks in order to maintain monetary and financial stability.
