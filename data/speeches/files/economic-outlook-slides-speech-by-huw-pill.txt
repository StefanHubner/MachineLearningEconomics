MPC monetary policy summary – June 2022
• The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the
2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit.
• The scale, pace and timing of any further increases in Bank Rate
will reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook and
inflationary pressures.
• The Committee will be particularly alert to indications of more
persistent inflationary pressures, and will if necessary act
forcefully in response.
